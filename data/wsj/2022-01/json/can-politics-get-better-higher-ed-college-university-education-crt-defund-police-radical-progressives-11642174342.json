    "body": "Only a few years ago, several well-established features of the current political landscape were too absurd to be taken seriously. Defunding the police was a ridiculous idea; critical race theory would be a giant step backward in race relations; leftist radicalism was a fringe element of the Democratic Party. Suddenly all have gone mainstream.<br />Recent election results have seemed encouraging. Voters rejected a ballot measure to defund the police in Minneapolis, and Glenn Youngkin’s gubernatorial victory in Virginia was in part a referendum on critical race theory. Voters punished Democrats for their sharp move to the left. But there is a less reassuring way of looking at these results. In Minneapolis, 44% of voters wanted to replace the city’s police department with a Department of Public Safety, which would have been mandated with a “comprehensive public health approach to safety,” and remove the minimum funding requirement for police. This is an astonishing level of support for sheer lunacy."
