    "body": "Vladimir Putin’s actions in Ukraine are hard to rationalize, but I suppose it’s possible he believes Ukraine might be allowed to join NATO and then with NATO’s backing be allowed to attempt to expel the Russian forces occupying parts of Eastern Ukraine since 2014.<br />Mr. Putin would face a no-win choice, war with NATO or accepting a defeat of his pet fighters that his personalized rule probably couldn’t survive. If Mr. Putin believes this, then he also believes the U.S. is willing to court big risks to end Mr. Putin’s rule."
