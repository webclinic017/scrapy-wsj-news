    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The World Trade Organization on Wednesday authorized China to impose retaliatory tariffs worth $645 million on imports from the U.S. in a decade-old dispute over Chinese subsidies to promote exports of products such as solar panels and steel pipes.<br />The ruling was made by a WTO arbitration panel in a case dating back to 2012. China had complained about the tariffs the U.S. had imposed between 2008 and 2012 on solar panels and other products that the U.S. said were produced with unfair subsidies to state-owned companies."
