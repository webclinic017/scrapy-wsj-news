    "body": "The biggest videogame releases during the holiday season apparently weren’t enough to inspire gamers to crank things up.<br />Turtle Beach ,  which specializes in headphones designed for gaming, said late Wednesday that revenue for the full year 2021 will come in around $365 million, the low end of its previously issued forecast. That indicates fourth-quarter revenue of around $108 million, which is about 6% shy of Wall Street’s forecasts and down nearly 19% from the same period a year earlier. Turtle Beach shares fell 3% on Thursday."
