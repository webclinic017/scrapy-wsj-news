    "body": "Many investment strategies optimistically promise a hockey-stick-shaped uplift in returns in the final years.  Deutsche Bank ’s  transformation is no exception: After 2½ years of steady progress, management is promising an astonishing 2022.<br />Last year’s profit was the highest in a decade for the German lender, prompting €300 million of share buybacks, equivalent to $337 billion, and €400 million in dividends. On Thursday management outlined a 2021 performance much in line with U.S. rivals: strong revenue growth with profits flattered by loan-loss reversals and tempered by cost inflation. That leaves the bank with a long way to run to meet its two key 2022 targets: Return on tangible equity (ROTE) of 3.8% last year compares with an 8% goal for this year, while its cost-to-income ratio of 85% was well short of the 70% mark. A share-price rise of 5% in early European trading seems generous."
