    "body": "India has reached an agreement to supply the Philippines with the BrahMos anti-ship cruise-missile system, officials from both sides said, in a deal that could help counterbalance recent Chinese assertiveness over disputes in the region.<br />The sale represents the first time that India has exported the BrahMos, which is made by an Indo-Russian joint venture based in New Delhi. It also comes as India expands defense ties with the U.S. and its allies in response to China’s growing military heft."
