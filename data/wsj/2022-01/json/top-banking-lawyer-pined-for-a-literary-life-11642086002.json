    "body": "The man who would become known as the dean of American banking lawyers—an authority on the most arcane legal precedents and turgid regulatory subsections—started off wanting a literary life and found time to write whimsical poems.<br />John D. Hawke Jr., known as Jerry, majored in English at Yale and hoped to become a writer, or perhaps a professor of literature. Among his friends and colleagues during a mid-1950s stint as an Air Force information officer was Hunter S. Thompson, later known as the dean of gonzo journalism. Mr. Hawke had plans for further studies of literature at Oxford in England."
