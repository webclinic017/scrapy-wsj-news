    "body": "Relief is beginning to make its way to the isolated Pacific nation of Tonga after an unusually violent volcanic explosion. Here’s a look at the damage, the science behind the tsunami and what’s next.<br />An explosion on Jan. 15 rained ash over the islands of Tonga and triggered tsunamis up to 50 feet high, according to the Tonga government.
