    "body": "JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia—Millions of Saudi children began returning to elementary school and kindergarten classrooms Sunday for the first time in nearly two years, a period of remote learning that was among the world’s longest and that angered parents.<br />For some Saudis and foreign workers, the return to the classroom was a relief. Parents said their children faced learning difficulties and emotional setbacks during distance learning, and they grew frustrated as they watched neighboring countries ease restrictions on classroom learning last year."
