    "body": "We hear a lot these days about threats to democracy, but a real assault on the foundations of our republican form of government is under way: the refusal of executive branches to enforce laws passed by the people’s elected representatives. Exhibit A is the new Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg.<br />New York State’s Constitution, like the U.S. Constitution, divides government into three equal branches—legislative, executive and judicial—to ensure checks and balances that protect liberty and democratic self-government. New York’s Constitution requires that the state Legislature write and pass the laws, while the role of the executive branch is to carry out those laws as drafted."
