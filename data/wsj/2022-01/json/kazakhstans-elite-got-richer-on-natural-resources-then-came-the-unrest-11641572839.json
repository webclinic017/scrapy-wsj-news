    "body": "Kazakhstan’s enormous reserves of oil, coal and precious metals offered the promise of a prosperous future for millions following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The country, the largest of the former Soviet states in Central Asia, represents 40% of the world’s uranium production alone.<br />Yet a failure to spread wealth has fed dissent, culminating in protests that have engulfed the country this week as anger over corruption, income inequality and the outsize wealth of a small group of oligarchs spilled over. That helped turn resentment over a rise in fuel prices into a broader protest against the country’s economy and its authoritarian leaders."
