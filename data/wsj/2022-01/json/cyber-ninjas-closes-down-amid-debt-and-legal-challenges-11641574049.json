    "body": "WASHINGTON—Cyber Ninjas, the company hired to lead a Republican-ordered review of Maricopa County’s 2020 election results, said it was shutting down, citing mounting legal costs and debt among other factors.<br />Previously a little-known cybersecurity firm, Cyber Ninjas became a central figure in an unusual review of the 2020 presidential results after Democrat Joe Biden won in Arizona’s most populous county. The state’s Republican-controlled Senate ordered the review and hired Florida-based Cyber Ninjas to lead the process, even though Maricopa County officials had already conducted other audits that found no problems with the county’s voting system."
