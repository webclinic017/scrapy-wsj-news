    "body": "A decision by the French government to force electricity giant  Électricité de France SA  to eat higher energy prices slammed the company’s shares, making the state-controlled utility a high-profile victim of Europe’s energy crisis.<br />The move reflects the fraught decisions facing governments in Europe over how to spread the pain from a surge in natural-gas and electricity prices. Regulated utilities are seen as low-risk bets for investors but Friday’s 19% drop in EDF’s shares was the biggest for the French firm since it listed in Paris in 2005, according to FactSet data."
