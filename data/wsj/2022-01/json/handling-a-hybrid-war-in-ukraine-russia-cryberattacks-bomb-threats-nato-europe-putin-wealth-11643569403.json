    "body": "By now Vladimir Putin must understand that an outright invasion of Ukraine would cause Russia economic pain, but the strongman may believe hybrid attacks could help him achieve his goals at a lower cost. The West can do more to disabuse him of the notion.<br />Hybrid attacks have already begun in Ukraine. Ukrainian security services have reported hundreds of fake bombing threats this year, prompting some schools to close. A cyber attack brought down several Ukrainian government websites this month, with a message on one hacked site warning “be afraid and expect worse.” Kyiv believes the attack was carried out by Russian ally Belarus, which complicates calculations about how to retaliate."
