    "body": "Eric Adams has made his first mistake as New York City’s new mayor, endorsing a City Council bill to let roughly 800,000 noncitizens vote in local elections. Mr. Adams said Saturday he looks forward to “bringing millions more into the democratic process”—assuming a court doesn’t block the plan, which is possible.<br />In either case, New York’s Democrats are handing Republicans a political issue. Note what Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said on TV over the weekend: “I think that we should have a constitutional amendment, a U.S. constitutional amendment, that only American citizens vote in our elections.”"
