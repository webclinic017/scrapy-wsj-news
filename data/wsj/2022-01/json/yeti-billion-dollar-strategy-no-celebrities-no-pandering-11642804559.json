    "body": "Yeti—the Texas maker of rugged coolers and drinkware—has transcended its outdoorsy roots to become a pop culture juggernaut and an accidental status symbol. When brothers Roy and Ryan Seiders set out to create a superior cooler for their hunting and fishing adventures in 2006, they could not have anticipated that their products would be carried and posted to social media by A-list celebrities like Matt Damon, Reese Witherspoon and Kim Kardashian, given shoutouts in songs like Chris Janson’s “Buy Me A Boat” (148 million views on YouTube since 2015) or become the unofficial mascot of tailgate parties and beach hangs everywhere. Its trendy logo hats are worn by fashion types and sorority members alike. On social media, Yeti obsessives display massive collections of products, and share photos of their “YOTD” (Yeti of the day).<br />But while most brands embrace influencer culture, Yeti is not taking the bait."
