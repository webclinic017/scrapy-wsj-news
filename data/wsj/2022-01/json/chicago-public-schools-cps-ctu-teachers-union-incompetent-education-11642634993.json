    "body": "“The Scandal of Chicago’s Teachers” (Review & Outlook, Jan. 6) wouldn’t exist but for the pusillanimous behavior of the Chicago Public Schools. This is the body that negotiates union contracts and establishes the budget. It is ultimately responsible for schools’ performance. Historically, it has been governed by mayoral appointees and does the mayor’s bidding.<br />Over the past 20 years, CPS has been the model of incompetence. Enrollment over that period has declined by about 25%, or 100,000 students. Over the same period, the budget has grown, in constant dollars, by over 80%."
