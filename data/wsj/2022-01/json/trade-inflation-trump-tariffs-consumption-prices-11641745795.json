    "body": "In “Joe Biden’s Inflationary Trade Policy” (op-ed, Jan. 5), William Walker and Stanton Anderson attempt to blame President Trump’s tariffs as the “real culprit” for President Biden’s inflation. Yet there was virtually no inflation for nearly three years after the Trump tariffs on steel and Chinese goods first went into effect in 2018. What changed in 2021 was massive new government spending and a disastrous new energy policy. That toxic combination—along with excessively easy monetary policy and loads of new regulation—is what caused inflation, not tariffs.<br />Tariff revenue may reach $100 billion this year, up threefold from 2016. That’s important, but it’s a rounding error in the context of a nearly $21 trillion economy. The Progressive Policy Institute recently estimated based on studies published in 2019 that the tariffs on Chinese goods at most have added 0.1 to 0.4 percentage points to an inflation rate that was near 7% in November. I suspect even that low estimate is too high, given steps companies have taken to restructure supply chains and avoid tariffs. But even if it is anywhere near accurate, that’s a small price to pay to lessen our dependence on China and protect U.S. jobs."
