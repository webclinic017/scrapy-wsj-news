    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol is readying a slate of public hearings for 2022, and the panel’s top Democrat left the door open to subpoenaing GOP lawmakers as part of its probe.<br />Rep. Bennie Thompson (D., Miss.), the committee’s chairman, said that the panel will call in state and local election officials who are charged with conducting elections; government officials who told the Trump administration they could find no fraud in the elections; and National Guard members who weren’t immediately authorized on Jan. 6 to help stem the riot."
