    "body": "What happens when the world’s biggest hedge fund finds itself secretly targeted for dueling takeovers by Vladimir Putin and a CIA-backed U.S. senator running for president? The events associated with this mouth-watering development, long whispered in the upper echelons of global security and finance circles, are the subject of “Undermoney,” Jay Newman’s debut novel.<br />It is an important story, and Mr. Newman, himself a former hedge-fund manager who specialized in sovereign debt, tells it with a combination of investigative skill and dramatic flair. Mr. Newman is perhaps best remembered in this newspaper for his role in recovering billions of dollars in defaulted debt from the government of Argentina on behalf of Elliott Management."
