    "body": "PARIS—President Emmanuel Macron set off a wave of criticism from his political opposition Wednesday by using a vulgar term to lash out at unvaccinated people, framing their refusal to inoculate as a betrayal of French citizenship.<br />“The unvaccinated, I really want to annoy them,” Mr. Macron said in an interview with the newspaper Le Parisien, using a vulgar word, emmerder, that can mean “piss off.” “They undermine the solidity of a nation. When my freedom threatens that of others, I become irresponsible. An irresponsible person is no longer a citizen.”"
