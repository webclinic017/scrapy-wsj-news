    "body": "WHY JUST LIFT heavy weights to get strong when you can improve your gains during cardio, or even build forearms of steel while simply washing the dishes? That’s the premise behind a new category of workout clothing that strategically disperses additional mass across your body through weights sewn into the fabric.<br />The key, fitness experts say, is putting the extra load on active muscles. Run in weighted leggings like those from Omorpho’s Mad Max-looking collection—which have half-spheres of weights dotted across the shins and thighs—and you’ll feel that extra resistance every time your feet push off the ground ($275, omorpho.fit). Play tennis in weighted arm sleeves like Kilogear Cut’s power shrug (from $75, kilogearcut.com) and you’ll work harder with every swing. Do a push up in Lila’s body armor-like Exogen top ($329, lilamovetech.com) and your arms will have to lift an extra one to 18 pounds of weight around your torso. (Adjust the resistance by slipping included weights of different sizes into the pockets.) Bonus: When you’re not wearing resistance, those moves will feel easier."
