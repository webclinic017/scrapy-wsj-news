    "body": "I read Karl Rove regularly because he is an astute observer of the political scene. But I’m surprised that in “Biden’s Georgia Election-Law Distortions” (op-ed, Jan. 13) he conflates offering food and drink to voters standing in sometimes long lines in untoward weather with “electioneering.” In several national elections, I have volunteered to offer water and snacks to voters in long lines, which the Georgia law now forbids. We were always warned not to solicit votes or ask who the voter will support or to wear clothing supporting particular candidates. To conflate this with “electioneering” is misrepresenting what usually happens on the ground level.<br />H. Thomas Blum"
