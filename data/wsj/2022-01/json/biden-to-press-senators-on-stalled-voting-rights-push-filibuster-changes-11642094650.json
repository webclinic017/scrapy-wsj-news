    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden expressed doubts that Democrats would pass their elections legislation after a key senator again stated her opposition to rules changes that would ease the bill’s path around Republican opposition.<br />“The honest to God answer is I don’t know if we can get this done,” Mr. Biden told reporters Thursday after a closed-door lunch with the Senate Democratic caucus. He said he still had hope, but added: “One thing for certain: Like every other major civil rights bill that came along, if we miss the first time, we can come back and try the second time.”"
