    "body": "The Democrats’ government student loan takeover in 2010 is one of the great policy fiascoes of the age. But politicians can never admit it, so instead they’re kicking Navient, the student loan servicer.<br />Navient, formerly Sallie Mae, on Thursday agreed to settle 39 state Attorneys General lawsuits by cancelling $1.7 billion in defaulted debt. It will also make $260 payments to 350,000 federal student loan borrowers who were allegedly wrongly placed in long-term forbearance."
