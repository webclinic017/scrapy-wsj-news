    "body": "Robinhood Markets ’ business is seeing some stability. Whether markets believe it is another matter.<br />The meme-stock driven events of a year ago were wild, to say the least, for Robinhood, and for markets in general. Since then, though, by some measures, things have been relatively steady for the upstart online brokerage: Robinhood has now produced roughly the same results in equities and options trading for three quarters in a row: about $50 million in equity transaction-based revenue and more than $160 million for options."
