    "body": "Kudos to Devorah Goldman for stating what all physicians know and most patients suspect: As medicine has become industrialized, “The Doctor’s Office Becomes an Assembly Line” (op-ed, Dec. 30).<br />Recently, my wife and I have been patients in the Stanford Health Care system. Although the staff is friendly and competent, the operations of the system assume the patient has no issues other than the chief complaint, that the caregiver likewise has no issues, and that we would have no problem with potentially conflicting appointments at different locations. There is no patient-care coordinator to knit together the raveled threads of care. There is nobody to consider as your advocate barring luck."
