    "body": "Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  doubled Chief Executive Officer David Solomon’s pay in 2021 after the Wall Street firm posted a record annual profit.<br />Mr. Solomon received a $35 million pay package for 2021, the bank said in a securities filing Friday. That is up from $17.5 million in 2020, when Goldman cut his pay by $10 million following the bank’s admission that it broke U.S. laws in its dealings with an investment fund at the heart of a global corruption ring."
