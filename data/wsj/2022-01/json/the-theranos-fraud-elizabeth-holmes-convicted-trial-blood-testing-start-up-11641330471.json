    "body": "Startup businesses fail all the time, and very few are frauds. The difference with Theranos is that founder Elizabeth Holmes refused to accept that her company’s blood-testing technology wasn’t working as she advertised, and on Monday a federal jury convicted her on four counts of defrauding investors.<br />Ms. Holmes started Theranos with the vision of making lab tests cheaper, faster and more accessible to patients by developing a small device that needed only a finger-prick of blood. Such a test would be revolutionary, but Ms. Holmes’s ambition exceeded the technology. She raised hundreds of millions of dollars from venture firms and wealthy investors, but along the way she misrepresented Theranos’s prospects."
