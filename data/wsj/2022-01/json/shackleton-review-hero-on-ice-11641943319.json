    "body": "The so-called Heroic Age of Antarctic exploration ran from the 1890s to the early 1920s. Its stars still burn brightly—perhaps especially so in our own gruesomely unheroic times—with Ernest Shackleton considered by many to be the brightest star of them all. Admired for his courage, leadership and grace under pressure, he was called The Boss by his colleagues. In lower latitudes, he drank and dallied and made mistakes like the rest of us: That, of course, is why we love him. This year marks the centenary of his death.<br />Ranulph Fiennes is arguably the world’s greatest living extreme adventurer. His many expeditions include the 1979 Trans Globe, during which his team became the first to circumnavigate the planet via both poles. Drawing on his own experience, Mr. Fiennes offers a rare perspective in “Shackleton: The Biography.” As he reminds us, “no previous Shackleton biographer has man-hauled a heavy sledge load through the great crevasse fields of the Beardmore Glacier, explored undiscovered icefields or walked a thousand miles on poisoned feet, hundreds of miles away from civilization.”"
