    "body": "LONDON—British Prime Minister Boris Johnson apologized for attending a drinks party held in the Downing Street garden when strict lockdown measures were in place in 2020, seeking to tamp down growing public outcry and respond to pressure from his own lawmakers over the event.<br />During a boisterous session in Parliament on Wednesday, Mr. Johnson said he regretted joining a party in Downing Street billed as a “bring your own booze” party. He explained that he thought the gathering was a work event. “I know the rage they feel with me, with the government I lead,” Mr. Johnson said."
