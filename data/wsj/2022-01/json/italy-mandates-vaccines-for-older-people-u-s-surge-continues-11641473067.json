    "body": "ROME–Italy made vaccination mandatory for older people, adopting some of the toughest vaccine requirements in the West in a bid to curb Covid-19 and Omicron’s spread, as figures from New York suggested the new variant produces fewer cases of severe disease.<br />The U.S. registered 643,660 cases Wednesday, down from record levels seen at the start of the week when more than one million cases were recorded following the holiday backlog. The seven-day average of daily case reports in the country continued to climb, however, reaching 574,725 on Wednesday, up from 303,476 the previous week, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University."
