    "body": "As the old saying goes, don’t mess with Texas rabbis. On Saturday foreign terrorist Malik Faisal Akram learned the hard way that even an unarmed and welcoming man of faith can be a formidable adversary when his flock is threatened.<br />Like so many classic Texans before him, Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker  of Colleyville’s Congregation Beth Israel didn’t start a fight but took decisive action to end one. The critical moment occurred after the anti-Semitic, America-hating terrorist had held Rabbi Cytron-Walker and two congregants hostage for 11 hours. Another hostage had been released earlier in the standoff, during which Akram talked by phone with law enforcement outside the synagogue."
