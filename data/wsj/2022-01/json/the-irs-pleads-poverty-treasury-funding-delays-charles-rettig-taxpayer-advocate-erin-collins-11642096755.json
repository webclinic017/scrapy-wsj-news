    "body": "Treasury officials held a press call on Monday warning of a very “frustrating” tax season ahead, including delayed refunds—and psst, blame Republicans. Sorry, the biggest culprits here are the pandemic and the surge in federal payments to individuals.<br />The Internal Revenue Service usually enters tax-filing season with a backlog of a million returns, but Treasury says this year the agency faces “several times” more. The IRS closed last filing season with more than 35 million unprocessed returns—nearly five times as many as in 2019 and three times more than 2020."
