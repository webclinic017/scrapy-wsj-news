    "body": "The physicist Richard Feynman once told a story about his father taking him out in the woods to observe nature. Feynman saw a bird and asked what it was called. His father said the name was irrelevant—it was only important to see how a bird behaved if you wanted to learn about it. I have a hard time remembering names, which is one of the reasons I became a physicist and not a physician, as my mother wanted.<br />Maybe this is why I have a hard time understanding how people can be so hurt by the use of some words and names. But Google and the other organizations that are creating the programming of the future and the apps that will govern our daily lives have decided some words are so dangerous that we need to excise them, not only from daily speech, but also from computer code."
