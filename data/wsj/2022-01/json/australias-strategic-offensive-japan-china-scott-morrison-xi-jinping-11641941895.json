    "body": "The last few months have been a whirlwind for Australia’s defense diplomacy as the South Pacific nation of 26 million braces itself against Chinese advances in the region. The latest example is Canberra’s new Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) with Tokyo, which makes it easier for Australia’s military to conduct operations out of Japan, and vice versa.<br />The new pact sets the legal terms for visiting forces in each country, and is notable because Tokyo has been reluctant to coordinate closely on military matters with any nation except the U.S. The RAA will give Aussie forces more access to Japanese territory, facilitating joint operations in the Northern Pacific, including contested waters in the East and South China Seas. Japanese forces can exercise with Australia in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific."
