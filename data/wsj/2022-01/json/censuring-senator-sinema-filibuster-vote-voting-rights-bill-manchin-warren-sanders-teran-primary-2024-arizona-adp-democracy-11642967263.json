    "body": "If there’s any remaining doubt that killing the Senate legislative filibuster is now Democratic Party orthodoxy, it vanished over the weekend when the executive board of the state party in Arizona voted to censure Sen. Kyrsten Sinema. Her offense was taking a position in favor of the filibuster—which was Democratic Senate orthodoxy as recently as two years ago.<br />“While we take no pleasure in this announcement, the ADP Executive Board has decided to formally censure Senator Sinema as a result of her failure to do whatever it takes to ensure the health of our democracy,” Arizona Democratic Party Chair Raquel Terán said in a statement. News reports say the vote was unanimous."
