    "body": "Millions of American families learned from the Internal Revenue Service this month that they may owe additional taxes for 2021. The reason was they’d received advance payments of the child tax credit last year that may have been too high. These families will now have to submit an additional form with their 2021 income-tax returns and pay whatever they owe (or claim whatever they still have coming). It’s a good lesson in the limitations of the IRS—it isn’t well-positioned to make welfare payments.<br />Although many families were caught by surprise, the potential for discrepancies in the payouts was never a secret. Lawmakers acknowledged it when they increased the credit’s value and authorized advance payments as part of last year’s American Rescue Plan. Knowing that not all the payments would line up fully with their criteria, Congress created a “safe harbor” so that two-parent families with less than $60,000 in income (and lower amounts for other types of households) wouldn’t be held liable for any miscalculations. For the many households not protected by this measure, the time for a reckoning has come. Both they and the IRS will have their hands full."
