    "body": "Economic globalization was supposed to make wars harder to start. What if the experience with Russia right now is demonstrating that globalization actually makes them harder to prevent?<br />For at least the last decade, a prevailing theory in international affairs has been that economic interdependence across the globe makes conflicts less likely. If everybody is tied together economically as never before, then everybody would suffer from large-scale conflict. Therefore, nobody would take that chance lightly. Economic ties would help ensure peace."
