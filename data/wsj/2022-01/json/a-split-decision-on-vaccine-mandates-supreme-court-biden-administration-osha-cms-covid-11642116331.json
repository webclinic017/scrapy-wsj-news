    "body": "The Supreme Court rebuked the Biden Administration’s vaccine mandates with one hand on Thursday but gave it a pass on the other. The split decision counts as a welcome setback for an overreaching administrative state, but not as welcome as it might have been.<br />In the more important decision, a 6-3 majority blocked the Occupational Health and Safety Administration’s sweeping mandate covering some 84 million employees of large employers. In an unsigned opinion, the Court said OSHA exceeded its statutory authority. And it has never adopted a “broad public health regulation of this kind—addressing a threat that is untethered, in any causal sense, from the workplace.”"
