    "body": "The People’s Republic of China expanded its attacks on Hong Kong’s liberties this past fall by menacing a statue at Hong Kong University commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. But all its aggression against the work of art may have done Beijing’s authoritarian agenda more harm than good.<br />“Pillar of Shame,” a 13-foot bronze piece by the Danish sculptor Jens Galschiøt, was installed at the university under the auspices of the Hong Kong Alliance in 1997 and has been an irritant to Beijing ever since, as Chinese authorities have worked to purge any record of Tiananmen. The upcoming Winter Olympics likely made the statue a more urgent problem for Beijing; the pillar was the focal point of pro-democracy protests around the time of the 2008 Summer Olympics. With most of the Hong Kong Alliance detained after the recent crackdown on dissent earlier this year, China finally moved against the statue. On Dec. 22, uniformed thugs put screens around the pillar, wrapped it in plastic, and carted it away to an unknown fate."
