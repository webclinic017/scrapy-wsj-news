    "body": "Republicans firmed up their Senate lineup to try to win back control of the 50-50 chamber this fall after both Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and John Thune of South Dakota said they would run for re-election.<br />The two men, who were the final GOP incumbents to announce their intentions, face different challenges in November. Mr. Johnson is from one of the nation’s most politically competitive states and is a strong supporter of Donald Trump, while Mr. Thune represents a reliably Republican constituency and has clashed with the former president."
