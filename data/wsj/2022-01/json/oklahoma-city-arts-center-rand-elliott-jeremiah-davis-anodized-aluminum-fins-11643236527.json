    "body": "Oklahoma City<br />There is no law in nature that says that the external skin of a thing must express its internal structure. After all, as the English writer and polymath John Ruskin liked to say, the stripes of a zebra do not describe its underlying bones or muscles. As in nature, so in architecture, where one of todayâ€™s most conspicuous trends is to treat the cladding of a building as a fully autonomous object, subject to nothing but its own aesthetic imperatives. Is there a more striking illustration of this trend than the Oklahoma Contemporary Arts Center, encased in a mantle of shiny aluminum fins that sparkle and twinkle like so many vertical sequins?"
