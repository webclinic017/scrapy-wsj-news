    "body": "Your editorial criticizing Senate Democrats’ efforts to protect Americans’ right to vote empowers those who sought on Jan. 6, 2021, to overturn the results of a free and fair election (“Schumer’s Filibuster Stunt,” Review & Outlook, Jan. 4).<br />In the wake of former President Trump’s Big Lie, the Republican Party has radicalized against democracy. Nineteen states have passed 33 laws to make it harder to vote. Election workers have endured violent threats over the past year simply for doing their jobs. These are not isolated developments. They are born of the same antidemocratic poison of last year’s deadly insurrection, and they urgently require the Senate to pass legislation."
