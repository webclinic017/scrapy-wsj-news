    "body": "Alan Blinder writes that inflation “still looks transitory” but admits “that doesn’t mean it will be over in a month or two” (“When It Comes to Inflation, I’m Still on Team Transitory,” op-ed, Dec. 30). Indeed, it doesn’t mean it will be over in a year or two. According to the Summary of Economic Projections released Dec. 15, most Federal Open Market Committee members think inflation should remain above the 2% target through 2024.<br />I suppose anything short of forever is transitory. But earlier statements from Chairman Jerome Powell led us to believe that inflation would not remain above target for so long."
