    "body": "Douglas Schoen and Andrew Stein posit that a midterm loss for the Democrats will set the stage for Hillary Clinton to make a run for the party’s presidential nomination in 2024 (“Hillary Clinton’s 2024 Comeback,” op-ed, Jan. 12). But their analysis omits the near certainty that Republican control of the Senate or House will result in a thorough investigation of the role of Mrs. Clinton and her campaign in the Steele dossier, FISA court warrants and the Russian collusion allegations during Donald Trump’s presidency. That investigation should end any thoughts of a Clinton candidacy.<br />Patrick Chassaing"
