    "body": "When the American Revolution ended, John Adams despaired that an accurate history of it would ever be written. “The Essence of the whole will be that Dr Franklins electrical Rod, smote the Earth and out Spring General Washington,” he wrote in 1790, “. . . and thence forward these two conducted all the Policy Negotiations Legislation and War.”<br />Woody Holton’s “Liberty Is Sweet” is the opposite of the narrow caricature Adams imagined. It is a sweeping narrative history of the Revolution that attempts to include everyone—slave and free, men and women, prosperous businessmen and indebted farmers, immigrants and Native Americans—into a single story of different people struggling for freedom."
