    "body": "Federal Judge Claude Hilton will hear complaints on Jan. 18 from Asian-American parents in Fairfax County, Va., who are upset with the new admissions policy at Thomas Jefferson High School. Though it has received little attention, the case draws back the curtain on how race is being used to discriminate against Asian-Americans. In so doing it also underscores what is at stake in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, an appeal of which the Supreme Court is considering whether to hear.<br />The allegation in both cases is the same: The schools want fewer Asian-Americans so they can make room for black, Latino and white applicants who are less qualified on the merits. Before the change, Thomas Jefferson was about 70% Asian-American. The big difference is that Thomas Jefferson is a public school and Harvard is private."
