    "body": "If the tech mavens are right, we will all soon live in the metaverse. But since the dictionary defines this mystical place as “a highly immersive virtual world where people gather to socialize, play, and work,” you might ask whether we don’t already live there.<br />For years political and cultural leaders in the real world have been creating a virtual, make-believe one, an artificially constructed reality of fable and allegory in which performative posturing is the modus operandi. The idea is that by operating in this world they signal their own virtue, relevance and even meaning."
