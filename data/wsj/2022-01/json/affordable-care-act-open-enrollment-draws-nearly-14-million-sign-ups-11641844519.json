    "body": "Almost 14 million people have signed up for health-insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment period ending Saturday, an increase driven by a robust outreach campaign and broader consumer subsidies.<br />More than 13.8 million consumers have signed up for 2022 healthcare coverage on the federal exchange, HealthCare.gov, and in states that run their own exchanges during the current enrollment period, officials said. That marks a 21% increase in sign-ups on the federal exchange compared with the previous year’s open-enrollment period, officials said."
