    "body": "Howard Solomon was chief executive of a New York-based pharmaceutical company, Forest Laboratories Inc., in 1994 when his 31-year-old son Andrew sank into a deep depression. The elder Mr. Solomon invited his son back into the family home in Manhattan, helped nurse him and searched for medications that might help.<br />That search increased Mr. Solomon’s interest in an antidepressant sold in Europe by a Danish company, H. Lundbeck AS. He approached Lundbeck about the possibility that Forest Labs could license the antidepressant for sale in the U.S. Lundbeck’s CEO, Erik Sprunk-Jansen, initially was reluctant to consider the idea."
