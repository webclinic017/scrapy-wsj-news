    "body": "Amid a spate of high-profile crimes, including the murder of two New York City police officers, Mayor Eric Adams debuted a plan to “end gun violence” and restore order. Part of the proposal is what he calls an “unprecedented” expansion of New York’s summer jobs program, creating jobs for up to 250,000 young New Yorkers.<br />While some may deride such programs as soft on crime, the Adams plan is smart on crime. As I discuss in a recent Manhattan Institute report, research has shown that summer jobs reduce crime, cutting participants’ risk of violent and property crime charges by 30% to 40%."
