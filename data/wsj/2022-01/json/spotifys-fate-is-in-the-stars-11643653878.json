    "body": "Whatever else he may be, no one should accuse Joe Rogan of not being a team player.<br />The actor/comedian/podcast star issued an apology of sorts via Instagram late Sunday night. The subject was some controversial episodes of his mega-popular podcast that have come under fire for containing alleged misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines. The controversy has resulted in a few high-profile musicians, most notably Neil Young, to remove their music from Spotify, which hosts Mr. Rogan’s program exclusively. Mr. Rogan added that he agreed with Spotify’s plan—also announced on Sunday—to add content advisories to any podcast episode that includes discussions of Covid-19."
