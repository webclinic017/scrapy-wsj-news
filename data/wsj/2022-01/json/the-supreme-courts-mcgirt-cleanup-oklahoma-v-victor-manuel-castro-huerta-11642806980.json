    "body": "The Supreme Court made a mess in Oklahoma two years ago, but the good news is the Justices might now be moving to help clean it up. On Friday they agreed to hear an appeal that could refill some of the prosecutorial vacuum left by McGirt, the High Court’s gravely misguided 2020 ruling.<br />The new case, Oklahoma v. Victor Manuel Castro-Huerta, involves a man convicted of child neglect. His disabled 5-year-old stepdaughter weighed 19 pounds when she was rushed to the ER, “covered in lice and excrement,” the state’s brief says. Her crib was found “filled with bedbugs and cockroaches and contained a single, dry sippy cup, the top of which was chewed through.”"
