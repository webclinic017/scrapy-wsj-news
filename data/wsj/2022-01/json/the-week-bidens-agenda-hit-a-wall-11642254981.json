    "body": "WASHINGTON—The bad news was unrelenting this week for President Biden: the highest inflation in four decades, a Supreme Court rejection of a key element of his plan to fight Covid-19 and more roadblocks in Congress.<br />Taken together, Mr. Biden’s rough week put into sharp relief the limits of the president’s powers, as he finds himself with little recourse to tame a pandemic, halt inflation or coax victories out of a 50-50 Senate."
