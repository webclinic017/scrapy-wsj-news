    "body": "Facing rising inflation and stock-market turbulence, President Biden met with top corporate executives to promote his stalled education, healthcare and climate bill Wednesday, saying the plan “lowers prices for families and gets people working,” in an attempt to counter criticism of the package.<br />The meeting came during a rocky period in financial markets, with the Federal Reserve signaling Wednesday it will embark on a series of rate increases starting in March to temper heightened inflation. The S&P 500 reversed early big gains to close down 0.1%, the sixth loss for the broad-based index in the past seven trading days. A new report on the country’s gross domestic product is expected Thursday and data on consumer spending Friday."
