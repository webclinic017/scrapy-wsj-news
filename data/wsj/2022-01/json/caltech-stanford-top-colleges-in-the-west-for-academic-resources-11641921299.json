    "body": "The California Institute of Technology ranks highest in the West and in the entire U.S. for academic resources in the Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education College Rankings. Stanford University is second in the region for resources, at No. 4 nationally.<br />The WSJ/THE ranking is based on 15 factors across four main categories: Forty percent of each school’s overall score comes from student outcomes, including measures of graduate salaries and debt burdens, 30% from the school’s academic resources, including how much it spends on teaching, 20% from how well it engages its students and 10% from its environment, a measure of student and faculty diversity."
