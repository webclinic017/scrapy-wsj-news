    "body": "WASHINGTON—It’s that time again. Tax-filing season is here, and the pandemic and its aftereffects are still causing complications. Here’s a guide to what you should expect as you prepare and file your returns.<br />The Internal Revenue Service will begin accepting 2021 individual income-tax returns on Jan. 24. Most taxpayers get refunds. Early filers tend to be lower-income households whose primary earnings come from their jobs. They are often trying to get that refund quickly and aren’t waiting on information from partnerships and investments, which are of greater importance to the wealthier investors who tend to file later."
