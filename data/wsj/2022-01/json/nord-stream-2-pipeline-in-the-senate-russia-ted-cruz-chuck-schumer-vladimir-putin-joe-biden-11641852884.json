    "body": "It’s a policy that’s hard to figure. While Vladimir Putin threatens to invade Ukraine, Europe and the Biden Administration are acquiescing in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will make Europe vulnerable to Russian energy coercion. This week the U.S. will have a chance to send a different message to the Kremlin.<br />The opening is a deal between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Ted Cruz. In exchange for ending Mr. Cruz’s blockade on 32 nominees, Mr. Schumer agreed to hold a vote by Jan. 14 on the Texas Senator’s Nord Stream 2 bill. The legislation would impose pipeline sanctions within 15 days, and a presidential move to lift or waive them would be subject to a Congressional vote."
