    "body": "TAIPEI—Freddy Lim, the frontman for a Taiwanese heavy-metal band, turned heads when he won his first term as a lawmaker in 2016, signaling to some youth in the island democracy that a new political era was dawning. Now, the 45-year-old is facing a recall.<br />He has a lot of company: Mr. Lim is the fifth elected politician in Taiwan to face a recall challenge in the past year. If he were to be voted out on Sunday, he would become yet another victim of what some Taiwanese describe as an emerging trend of “revenge recalls.”"
