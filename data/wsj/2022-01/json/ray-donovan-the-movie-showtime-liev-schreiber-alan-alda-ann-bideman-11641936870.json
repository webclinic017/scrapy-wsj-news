    "body": "The hard-core base will be hoping that Showtime’s “Ray Donovan: The Movie” will be at least as shocking as “Ray Donovan: The Cancellation.” Even the show’s creative team was sandbagged by the 2020 decision to end the show after seven seasons—unceremoniously and without anything close to closure. Consider the movie an act of appeasement.<br />Consider it, also, something almost exclusively for the existing “Ray” fan, the viewer already familiar with the series created by writer and producer Ann Biderman (“Southland”) and starring Liev Schreiber as Donovan, a Hollywood fixer who went about getting his celebrity clients out of various degrees of trouble. And who wasn’t averse to cracking heads to do so. As “The Movie” relates—no spoilers will be forthcoming—it all began in Boston, where the story takes place. As befitting its tone of seriousness and self-regard, it has an ending that’s close to Shakespearean."
