    "body": "Twitter Inc.  will start allowing some users to use nonfungible tokens as their profile pictures, jumping into a digital-goods business that has exploded over the past year.<br />The feature, launching Thursday, is being offered to users of Twitter’s Blue subscription service. It marks the company’s biggest push thus far into NFTs, which are tokens that act as vouchers of authenticity for virtual goods, such as digital art, that can be tracked and traded along blockchain technology, a type of digital ledger."
