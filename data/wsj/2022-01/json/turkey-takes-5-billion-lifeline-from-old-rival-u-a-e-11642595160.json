    "body": "ISTANBUL—The United Arab Emirates and Turkey agreed to a currency swap equivalent to nearly $5 billion that reinforces an economic partnership between two Middle Eastern rivals and provides Ankara with a badly needed infusion of foreign funds.<br />The deal, announced Wednesday, deepens the detente between Turkey and the U.A.E., powers that until recently were on opposite sides of a Middle Eastern cold war and remain at odds over conflicts in the region. The two struggled for supremacy in the aftermath of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings and later backed opposing sides in the civil war in Libya and in Saudi Arabia’s blockade of Qatar."
