    "body": "As a commentator on fashion, I spend a lot of time peering down at men’s shoes. I recall in the aughts noticing, abruptly, that every man who could plausibly have a graphic design degree was wearing crisp white Common Projects sneakers. (I wondered if sales of toothbrushes also spiked, driven by persnickety twenty-somethings trying to keep their shoes box-fresh.) Four years ago, it was Allbirds’s wooly, $95 sock-like shoes cladding feet across New York City, and appearing to find a particularly strong foothold with tech-bro types.<br />Recently, I’ve observed a similar shoe surge, this time, of Loro Piana’s minimalistic Open Walk slip ons, which the brand has sold since 2005, but for many reasons seem to have soared in popularity of late. They’re tough to describe: Though the sole is white and rubber like a sneaker’s, the upper is supple and a bit chiseled, recalling an Italian Chukka boot. (Loro Piana is based in Milan, Italy.) Suede Open Walks retail for $1,050, and a pair in deerskin will chomp $2,425 out of your checking account. Their more-loafery sibling, the Summer Walk, recalls laceless Sperry boat shoes—but cost $995 in leather, roughly ten times as much (and $875 in suede). (Through a representative, the brand declined a request for an interview.)"
