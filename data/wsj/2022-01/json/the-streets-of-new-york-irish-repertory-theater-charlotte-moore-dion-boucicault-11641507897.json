    "body": "New York<br />Theater lovers throughout America owe a huge debt to the Irish Repertory Theatre for having kept us sane and entertained by streaming exemplary, standard-setting video productions throughout the Covid-19 lockdown. Now the Irish Rep, for me New York’s finest off-Broadway theater, is reopening its doors with a revival of Charlotte Moore’s 2002 musical version of Dion Boucicault’s “The Streets of New York.” In his play, the celebrated 19th-century theatrical ne’er-do-well, who died in New York in 1890 after spending his career shuttling back and forth across the Atlantic, told a succulent tale of melodramatic woe. It is greatly enhanced by Ms. Moore’s songs and is performed to the hilt by her new cast (a fine director, she has also staged this production)."
