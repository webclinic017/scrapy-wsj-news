    "body": "LONDON—A baking competition. Hundreds of street parties. A large military parade and beacons lit across the country.<br />Buckingham Palace is pulling out the stops to mark Queen Elizabeth II’s 70 years on the British throne. The bumper celebration for the country’s longest-serving monarch will look to both commemorate her historic contribution to the British nation and act as a rallying point following a tumultuous few years for both the country and its monarchy."
