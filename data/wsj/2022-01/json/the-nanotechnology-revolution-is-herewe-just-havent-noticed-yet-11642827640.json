    "body": "Before there was a “metaverse,” before there were crypto millionaires, before nearly every kid in America wanted to be an influencer, the most-hyped thing in tech was “nanotechnology.” “Nano-,” for those who could use a refresher, means “one billionth,” and nanotechnology generally refers to materials manipulated at an atomic or molecular scale.<br />For decades, computer scientists and physicists speculated that, any minute now, nanotechnology was going to completely reshape our lives, unleashing a wave of humanity-saving inventions. Things haven’t unfolded as they predicted but, quietly, the nanotech revolution is under way."
