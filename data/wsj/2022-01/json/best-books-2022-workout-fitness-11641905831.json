Swish some Gatorade and spit it out in the sink.<br />That is one taste of the unconventional advice in the year’s new fitness books, which zero in on the brain’s role in exercise and ways that movement can improve cognitive function and mental health. Several books explore not only how movement affects the brain, but also how the brain affects movement, offering ideas about mindfulness during workouts or tricks to short-circuit the brain’s barriers to exercise. (The Gatorade swish, one book theorizes, misleads the brain into thinking the system is getting a jolt of energy from a sugary beverage, even if it isn’t.)"
