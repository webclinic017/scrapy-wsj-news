    "body": "LONDON—Trian Fund Management LP, the activist hedge fund run by Nelson Peltz, has acquired a stake in  Unilever  PLC, according to people familiar with the matter, adding pressure to the packaged food and consumer goods giant in the wake of its failed $68-billion bid for  GlaxoSmithKline  PLC’s consumer-health business.<br />The size of the stake couldn’t be learned. Trian started buying Unilever shares well before its bids for the GSK unit surfaced earlier this month, one of the people said."
