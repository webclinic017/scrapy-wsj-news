    "body": "With Covid cases surging, the December jobs report counts as old news. But it might say more about the general state of the labor market than whatever the January report ends up showing.<br />The Labor Department on Friday reported that the economy added a seasonally adjusted 199,000 jobs last month. That was well short of the 422,000 economists had expected, though any disappointment was tempered by upward revisions to the previous two months that added 141,000 jobs to the nation’s employment count."
