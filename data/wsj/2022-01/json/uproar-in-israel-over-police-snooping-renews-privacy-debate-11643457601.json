    "body": "TEL AVIV—For years, governments around the world used Israeli company NSO Group’s software to spy on journalists, activists and dissidents, prompting the U.S. to blacklist it. Now, a firestorm has erupted here over whether the company’s tools were used to illegally monitor Israelis.<br />Israel’s police say they use a variety of spyware tools, including one developed by NSO, known for its Pegasus software, which can infect and completely take over a smartphone without the target being aware. The police haven’t said how similar spyware that has been tailored for their use is to Pegasus, only that Israeli law allows them limited access. They say spyware is crucial for tracking criminal activity amid a rise in the use of encrypted software in phone apps like WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal."
