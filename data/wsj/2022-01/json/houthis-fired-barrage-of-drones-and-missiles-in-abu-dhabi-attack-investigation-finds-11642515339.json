    "body": "This week’s attack on Abu Dhabi was carried out with advanced missiles and drones launched from Yemen by Houthi militants, said people familiar with a United Arab Emirates probe, showing how Iran’s allies have become emboldened in striking Middle East rivals after emerging stronger from years of civil war.<br />The deadly Houthi strike on Monday amounted to the most visible display of the military advancements made by a militia that less than a decade ago relied on machine guns and rocket launchers but now can help Iran project power almost 1,000 miles away from their Yemeni mountain strongholds. The Houthis have hit the U.A.E. before, but this was the first time the Emiratis acknowledged it."
