    "body": "Given the alacrity with which the White House seized on Justice Stephen Breyer’s retirement, the administration is clearly banking on a confirmation fight giving the Democratic Party a midterm lift. That calculation may prove as misguided as any other so far in Joe Biden’s presidency. Especially if the president again dances to progressive demands.<br />Justices often give the White House an early heads-up about retirement plans with the expectation the news will remain confidential until later in the court’s term. So eager was the Biden administration to change the headlines from inflation, Covid and the president’s crummy ratings, it didn’t grant Justice Breyer that courtesy. The Wednesday news leaks force-marched Justice Breyer into penning an official retirement letter the next day."
