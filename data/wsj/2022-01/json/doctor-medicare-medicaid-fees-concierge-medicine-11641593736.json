    "body": "Regarding Devorah Goldman’s op-ed “The Doctor’s Office Becomes an Assembly Line” (Dec. 30): The main issue in the decline of private doctors’ offices is the imposition of price controls. Since the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) instituted an arbitrary formula called RBRVS for establishing the value of physicians’ services, prices have been rigidly controlled.<br />With CMS, doctors by law may not charge more than Medicare and Medicaid allows. Pay for doctors’ services in independent offices have been held down, forcing doctors to sell out to hospitals. Private carriers pay doctors more than CMS, but they enforce de facto price controls by following RBRVS and making take-it-or-leave-it provider contracts with doctors."
