    "body": "IN LATE DECEMBER, days before the new year, a package landed at my doorstep. It contained a new purchase—one of the most talked-about items of clothing in recent memory: a Yeezy Gap Round Jacket (pictured above). Round indeed. The $200 coat looks like a wearable jumbo beach ball. Or perhaps more accurately, given its electric indigo shade, like some mutant, genetically modified blueberry.<br />This bulbous jacket is the first design to come out of a collaboration between Gap and Ye, the rapper who recently changed his name from Kanye West. Struck in 2020, the partnership is purportedly projected to last 10 years. Where Ye goes, chatter follows (as his recent paparazzi-tracked relationship with the actress Julia Fox proves) and this collaboration has been no different. Since sending friends photos of the coat, I’ve been subjected to an onslaught of breathless questions: How does it fit? How can I buy it? What does it even look like in person? Here, I answer those questions, and more, as I try to demystify Yeezy Gap."
