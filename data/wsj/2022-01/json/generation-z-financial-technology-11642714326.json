    "body": "Generation Z doesn’t know a world without mobile banking. And that presents opportunities—and challenges—for financial-technology companies.<br />Millennials ushered in the era of financial technology as we know it by embracing payment apps like Venmo and investing platforms like Robinhood and Acorns. But Gen Z grew up immersed in that technology—and they won’t be attracted by ease and novelty the way earlier generations were. They don’t want products that are designed for masses of users. Instead, they are looking for highly personalized experiences."
