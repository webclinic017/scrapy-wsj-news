    "body": "Democrats are poised to take sole control of drawing congressional districts in New York for the first time in more than 50 years after state lawmakers rejected maps from an independent commission.<br />The bipartisan panel failed to reach consensus on district lines and instead presented separate sets of maps drawn by its Republican and Democratic commissioners. The proposals were voted down last week by wide margins in the state Assembly and Senate, and the commission has one more chance to draw acceptable lines later this month before the process would shift to the Democrat-dominated state Legislature."
