    "body": "President Biden took questions from the press for nearly two hours Wednesday, his 364th day in office, which would have been an opportune moment to announce a change in strategy or agenda. In one poll this week, 37% of voters graded his first year as an F, and another 12% gave it a D.<br />Instead Mr. Biden offered more of the same. No, he said, he didn’t overpromise the public about what he could accomplish. He believes he has “outperformed” and delivered “enormous progress.” Americans simply don’t know the details of his successes. He had “no apologies” for the debacle in Afghanistan."
