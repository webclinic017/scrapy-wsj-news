    "body": "Argentine President Alberto Fernández said Friday that his government reached a deal with the International Monetary Fund to restructure a $44 billion bailout that would help the South American country avert a debt default and currency meltdown after being locked out of global financial markets.<br />Mr. Fernández, a member of the nationalist Peronist movement, said the agreement would allow the cash-strapped nation to turn around an economy that has been mired in financial turmoil since 2018. The deal will require approval by Argentina’s congress and the IMF’s board."
