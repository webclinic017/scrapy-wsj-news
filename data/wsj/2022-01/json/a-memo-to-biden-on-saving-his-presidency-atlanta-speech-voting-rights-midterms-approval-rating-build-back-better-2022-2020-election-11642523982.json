    "body": "Mr. President: After a year in office, your presidency is at a low ebb, and the 52nd week could hardly have gone worse. Most Americans don’t see you working on the problems they care about the most—the pandemic and inflation—and what you are doing isn’t working. Only 36% think your administration’s fight against the coronavirus is going well. Even fewer (30%) give you a passing grade on inflation.<br />On Covid, the people have specific complaints. They don’t support your effort to extend vaccine mandates and they don’t think your administration was prepared for the Omicron variant. Medical professionals have noted the failure to ramp up the procurement of home tests during the summer and fall of 2021. About 7 in 10 Americans believe that the information coming out of your pandemic task force has been confusing."
