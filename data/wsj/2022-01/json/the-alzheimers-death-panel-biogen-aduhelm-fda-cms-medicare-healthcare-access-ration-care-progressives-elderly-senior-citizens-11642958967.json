    "body": "President Biden says he wants to increase healthcare access. But this is hard to square with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ unprecedented proposal this month to restrict Medicare payment for a class of novel Alzheimer’s treatments.<br />The CMS recommendation follows the controversy over Food and Drug Administration approval last summer of  Biogen ’s  Alzheimer’s treatment Aduhelm. The monoclonal antibody clears amyloid plaque in the brain, a hallmark of the disease. It is the first treatment shown in clinical trials to slow Alzheimer’s progression."
