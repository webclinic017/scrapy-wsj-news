    "body": "The Biden Administration on Tuesday ordered another 600,000 doses of  GlaxoSmithKline  and  Vir Biotechnology ’s  monoclonal antibody. Last week it increased its order of  Pfizer ’s  antiviral Paxlovid by 10 million. Great, but these treatments will probably arrive after the Omicron Covid variant crests. Why didn’t it order more treatments sooner?<br />That’s an especially good question given that the stated purpose of Democrats’ $1.9 trillion spending bill last March was Covid relief. Yet less than 1% of the spending was allocated for therapies. About as much money was given last year to New York’s financially ailing transit system as the Administration spent procuring Covid therapies. The result: A persistent treatment shortage and countless preventable deaths."
