    "body": "Illegal border crossings into the European Union in 2021 were the highest since 2017, indicating the bloc hasnâ€™t resolved an issue that has dogged it in recent years.<br />Authorities in member countries reported almost 200,000 migrants tried to cross into the EU last year, a 57% increase compared with 2020 and about a third more than in 2019. Covid-19 restrictions in 2020 in North Africa and other areas stemmed the flow."
