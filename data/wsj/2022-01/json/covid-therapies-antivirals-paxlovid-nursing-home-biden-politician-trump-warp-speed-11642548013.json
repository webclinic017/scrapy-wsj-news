    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Biden’s Operation Snail Speed” (Jan. 13): I am the medical director of several nursing homes in the Denver area. Residents (patients) are dying because we can’t get any Paxlovid. The institutional pharmacies that supply medicines to the nursing homes tell me that they don’t expect to receive any for the foreseeable future. It is not always feasible to transfer elderly residents to hospitals, which have their own challenges at the moment and may not have any Paxlovid anyway.<br />I cannot help but contrast this abysmal situation with the one a year ago, following Operation Warp Speed. By January 2021, my nursing homes all had access to Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine. I understand that a large order for Paxlovid was placed only recently and that we may not have adequate supplies until July. This is mind boggling, and no, I am not a Republican."
