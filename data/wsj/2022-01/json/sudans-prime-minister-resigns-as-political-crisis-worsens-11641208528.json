    "body": "Sudan’s Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok resigned late Sunday, abandoning his weekslong efforts to form a new technocratic government to pull the country out of its economic crisis and a worsening political standoff.<br />Mr. Hamdok was head of Sudan’s fragile transitional government following the ouster of long-serving leader Omar al-Bashir in 2019 before being toppled and detained in an October coup. Following a deal with military leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Mr. Hamdok was reinstated in November but protest leaders rejected the agreement and have been demanding a full restoration of civilian rule, plunging the country into weeks of protests as inflation soared and food shortages spread."
