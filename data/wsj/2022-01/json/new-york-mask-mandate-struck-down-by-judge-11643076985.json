    "body": "A Long Island judge struck down New York state’s indoor mask mandate Monday, saying health officials needed approval from the legislature for a December rule requiring face coverings in schools, transit hubs and other indoor settings.<br />State Supreme Court Justice Thomas Rademaker ruled in Nassau County that Health Commissioner Mary Bassett didn’t have the authority to issue an emergency regulation last year requiring masks in indoor settings. Dr. Bassett’s masking rules were issued after Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency amid rising Covid-19 infections on Nov. 26."
