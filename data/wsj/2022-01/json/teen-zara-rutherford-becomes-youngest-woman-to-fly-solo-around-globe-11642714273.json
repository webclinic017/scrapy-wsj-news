    "body": "Zara Rutherford spent 155 days flying around the world, navigating rains, turbulence, wildfire smoke and other challenges before landing in Belgium Thursday, completing her quest to become the youngest woman to fly around the globe solo.<br />With her trip, Ms. Rutherford broke the record for youngest woman to fly around the world solo, which was held by Shaesta Waiz, who made her voyage in 2017 at the age of 30, according to Guinness World Records. The youngest person to make the solo trip is still Travis Ludlow, who did so last year when he was 18."
