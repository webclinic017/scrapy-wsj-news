    "body": "OPEC appointed a veteran Kuwaiti oil official as its next secretary-general, an administrative role that also serves as a communication channel between the cartel’s often-fractious internal politics and the rest of the world—whose economies often can be greatly affected by the group’s oil-production policy.<br />At a virtual meeting Monday, the 13-strong Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries appointed Haitham al-Ghais to the post, replacing Mohammad Barkindo, a former Nigerian oil official who has held the position for two terms since 2016. He will take the reins from Mr. Barkindo in August."
