    "body": "HONG KONG—Activist Edward Leung rose to prominence on the now-banned slogan “Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times,” but he didn’t get to see it become a rallying cry during the city’s mass protests in 2019.<br />The activist was in prison on an earlier rioting conviction when protesters swarmed Hong Kong that year, adopting his philosophy of forceful resistance in monthslong battles with police. Now the 30-year-old Mr. Leung, who is expected to be released as soon as Wednesday, will step back into a profoundly changed city."
