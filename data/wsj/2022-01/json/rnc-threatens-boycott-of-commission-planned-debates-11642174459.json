    "body": "The Republican National Committee is threatening to prohibit its future presidential nominees from participating in general election debates sponsored by a commission that has been the official organizer of such events for more than three decades as it sought to address grievances leveled by former President Donald Trump and others in the party.<br />Ahead of its winter meeting next month, the RNC made clear this week that it will seek a change in its rules that would require presidential candidates pursuing the partyâ€™s nomination to pledge not to participate in debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates."
