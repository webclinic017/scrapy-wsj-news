    "body": "Meat Loaf died on Thursday, age 74, at his home in California. The cause of death has yet to be confirmed. A flamboyant titan in voice and form, he brought joy to millions and left millions more in perplexity. Who was this stack-heeled, sweating beast, bursting out of his white ruffled shirt as he bellowed through teenage melodramas about making out by the lake and death by motorcycle? What possessed people to buy his albums and make “Bat Out of Hell,” his monstrous, melodramatic concept album of 1977, one of the biggest-selling rock albums of all time?<br />You either got it or you didn’t, and if you got it, you got the lot. Meat Loaf embodied rock ’n’ roll in all its promise and decay. The passions of youth wobbled within a body run to seed; the simple pleasures of Elvis in the youth of his golden Sun recordings flowered into the sickly extravagance of Elvis in his lusting, swollen Vegas dotage. We never, as Meat Loaf sang on his epic signature song “Bat Out of Hell,” “see the sudden curve before it’s way too late.” The arc of the music, the arc of a life."
