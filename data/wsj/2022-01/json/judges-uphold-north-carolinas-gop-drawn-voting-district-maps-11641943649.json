    "body": "A North Carolina court on Tuesday upheld the state’s new Republican-drawn voting maps, rejecting claims that they were illegally gerrymandered for partisan advantage.<br />A three-judge panel in Wake County Superior Court said while excessive partisanship in redistricting was incompatible with democratic principles and had subjected the state to many years of ridicule, the court had no basis for constraining the legislature."
