    "body": "By most measures, 2021 was a good year to be an energy investor. According to research firm Morningstar Inc., energy outperformed every other funds sector, and asset flows into these funds grew a net $11.4 billion. As economies around the world started to reopen, energy demand surged, fueling a rebound by energy stocks.<br />Those same stocks could be poised to perform well this year, as energy demand remains elevated. Limited oil and gas supply is also likely to keep prices high. A recent research note from UBS suggested that oil could stay above $80 a barrel in 2022; itâ€™s around $80 now."
