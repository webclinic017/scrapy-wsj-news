    "body": "During his press conference last week President Biden was asked to comment on U.S. foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere. He riffed on Central America, said he’d spent “a lot of time talking about” Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro, and incoherently referenced Chile and Argentina. He went on to express concern about the shrinking number of democracies in the world.<br />Yet strangely the president never mentioned the region’s heart of darkness, the 63-year-old military dictatorship in Havana."
