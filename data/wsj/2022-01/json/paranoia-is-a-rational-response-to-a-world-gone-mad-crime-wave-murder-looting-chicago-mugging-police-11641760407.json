    "body": "Paranoia, in our time at least, is the better part of valor. Our time is a time of rampant crime: muggings, carjackings, smash-and-grab store lootings, and random murder. I have not been directly affected by any of this marauding, but hearing about it on television and radio news, receiving online flashes about it on my cellphone and stories from friends, I find myself affected by it, as I suspect most people are.<br />The other night at 7, I left to pick up dinner at a restaurant less than 100 yards from our apartment building. I walked warily on the deserted street over to the restaurant, and when I returned, using my fob to get back into our building, I heard myself exhale a sigh of relief. I live in Evanston, Ill., the first suburb north of Chicago, traditionally a peaceful place once known as the land of the blue-rinse dowager."
