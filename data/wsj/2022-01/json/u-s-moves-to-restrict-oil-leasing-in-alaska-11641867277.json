    "body": "The Interior Department said Monday that it plans to block oil and gas leasing on about 11 million acres on Alaskaâ€™s North Slope, or roughly half of a 23-million acre reserve set aside for energy development decades ago.<br />The action, announced in connection with a federal lawsuit brought by environmentalists, would reverse a Trump administration effort to expand oil production in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska."
