    "body": "Big private-equity firms have outgrown that label, but investors can now buy something closer to a purebred.<br />TPG is the latest firm with roots in private equity to list its shares—they began trading on Thursday. It will be something of a unique play among publicly traded alternative-investment managers, as they are now often known, in that it is still largely in the private-equity business. Roughly 80% of its assets under management are in private-equity strategies, which is high among large publicly traded peers, according to figures compiled by Autonomous Research analyst Patrick Davitt.
