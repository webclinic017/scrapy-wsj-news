    "body": "In the mid-1980s, Richard J. Ferris assembled what he hoped would be a one-stop shop for travelers. As chief executive of the holding company for  United Airlines ,  he led acquisitions of the Hertz car-rental business and the Hilton International hotel chain.<br />For a time, Hertz customers could check their luggage on a United flight while returning a rental car. Long before the internet made reservations simple, Mr. Ferris believed customers would reward a company that let them book a flight, a car and a room with one call."
