    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”Alabama on Friday asked the Supreme Court to reinstate the new congressional map its Republican-controlled legislature drew to reflect 2020 census data after a lower court blocked its use for discriminating against Black voters.<br />The emergency appeal is a preview of what is expected to be another intense year of election litigation, especially with nationwide redistricting in light of the 2020 census. Many states also are considering changes to their voting rules based on their experiences conducting the 2020 election during the pandemic."
