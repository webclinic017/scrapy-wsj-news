    "body": "In the evolution of soul, there’s before Al Green and after. Prior to the singer-songwriter’s “Let’s Stay Together” album—released 50 years ago, on Jan. 31, 1972—male romantic soul tended to be the domain of vocal-harmony groups like the Temptations, the Intruders, the Four Tops and the Delfonics, pop-gospel crooners such as Sam Cooke, Smokey Robinson and Marvin Gaye, and emotive shouters like Percy Sledge, Wilson Pickett and Otis Redding.<br />After the chart success of “Let’s Stay Together,” Mr. Green’s hushed, cooing vocal approach set new boundaries for soul seduction and altered the genre’s landscape. The album peaked at No. 8 on the Billboard pop chart and remained at No. 1 on the R&B chart for 10 weeks, reaching gold status (500,000 copies sold) by the end of April 1972."
