    "body": "An activist investor is renewing a push to get department-store chain  Kohl’s Inc.  to take action to boost its lagging stock.<br />Macellum Advisors GP LLC, which has a roughly 5% stake in Kohl’s, has been urging the company to make changes including altering its board, people familiar with the matter said. Kohl’s has so far rejected Macellum’s request to add directors with retail experience or a shareholder to its board, the people said. The New York hedge fund, which was part of a group that ran a proxy fight at the retailer last year, now expects to do so again."
