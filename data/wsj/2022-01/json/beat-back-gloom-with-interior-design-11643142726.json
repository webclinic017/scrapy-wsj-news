    "body": "WHEN SEATTLE DESIGNER Lauren Caron embarked upon a recent renovation of a home in the city’s historic Capitol Hill neighborhood, her primary challenge was making the 1930s English-style cottage feel fresh and feminine—more Lady Mary than lord of the manor.<br />“The previous owner was a designer for Ralph Lauren, so it was very beautifully done, but not the aesthetic the client wanted,” said Ms. Caron, who founded Seattle’s Studio Laloc and partnered with Mallet Design Build on this project. “It was all very stereotypically masculine.” To bring the spaces in sync with the new stewards—a single, 40-something philanthropist and her beloved hairless cat, Prunella—Ms. Caron took an eclectic approach, adding glam architectural flourishes and a palette of moody pinks, greens and golds as the backdrop for the client’s vintage art and antiques. Above all, she said, she was guided by a principle of softness: “The colors in the house are rich but also a bit muddy, which gives it a warm feeling on gray Seattle days.”"
