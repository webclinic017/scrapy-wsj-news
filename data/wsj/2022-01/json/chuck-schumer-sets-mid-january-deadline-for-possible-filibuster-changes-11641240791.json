    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) set a mid-January deadline for trying to change the chamber’s procedures on passing legislation if Republicans again block Democrats’ proposed changes to the nation’s election systems.<br />Mr. Schumer laid out his plans regarding the filibuster in a letter to colleagues at the start of the second session of the current Congress and as the country approaches the first anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. In that siege, supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol in a failed attempt to stop Congress from certifying President Biden’s election victory."
