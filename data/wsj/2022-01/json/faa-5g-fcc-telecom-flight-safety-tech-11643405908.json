    "body": "Your editorial “How to Mess Up a 5G Rollout” (Jan. 19) states, “some 20 months later, the FAA demanded to relitigate the [March 2020] FCC decision and took airlines and carriers hostage.” In fact, Transportation Department general counsel Steven Bradbury and Federal Aviation Administrator Steve Dickson voiced detailed safety concerns in a letter to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration in December 2020. NTIA, not FAA, chose not to put this letter in the FCC record.<br />Messrs. Bradbury and Dickson stated, “Recent testing and analyses reveal the potential for harmful interference to radar altimeters installed in thousands of commercial transport aircraft, general aviation aircraft, business jets, and helicopters.” Had FAA concerns been addressed by the FCC in 2020, wireless companies could have made 5G safer by lowering their transmitters’ power and adjusting their antennas’ angles, as was done in France and Canada."
