    "body": "In a way,  Netflix  might soon find out just how critic-proof it really is.<br />The streaming giant is raising its prices for the U.S. and Canadian markets. The new ones—announced Friday—amount to an 11% increase across the board for its three subscription plans. That is notably more than the company’s last round of increases in October 2020, which raised the price on only two plans and amounted to an average raise of about 8%."
