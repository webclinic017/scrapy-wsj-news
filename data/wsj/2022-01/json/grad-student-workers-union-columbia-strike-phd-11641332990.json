    "body": "Jared Sacks (Letters, Jan. 3) seeks to rebut Provost Mary Boyce’s assertion of Columbia’s generosity toward its Ph.D. students (Letters, Dec. 27). Unfortunately, he undermines his argument when he attempts to turn Columbia’s coverage of tuition cost of $55,000 into a self-serving “accounting trick.” Surely, this must count as a legitimate cost to the university.<br />One should be clear that the teaching duty aims to provide grad students the skills to become full-fledged academics. As such, students are not “workers,” but petit bourgeois apprentices to a craft that they will exercise after a stint at Columbia. It is an aspect of their education aimed at launching their professional careers. So too their research activities, which serve directly their future careers, and are not taken up in Columbia’s service, as Mr. Sacks perversely suggests."
