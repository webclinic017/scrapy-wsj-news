    "body": "Vaccines and booster shots offer superior protection from the Delta and Omicron variants, according to three new studies released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />The data back up earlier findings supporting booster shots and offer the first comprehensive insight into how vaccines fare against the Omicron variant. In one of the studies published Friday, a CDC analysis found that a third dose of either the vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  or  Moderna Inc.  was at least 90% effective against preventing hospitalization from Covid-19 during both the Delta and Omicron periods."
