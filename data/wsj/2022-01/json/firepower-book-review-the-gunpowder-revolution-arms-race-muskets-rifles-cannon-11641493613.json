    "body": "No one knows exactly when gunpowder, a Chinese invention dating to the ninth century, arrived in the West. The English natural philosopher and cleric Roger Bacon described its formula—sulphur, charcoal, saltpeter—in the late 13th century; it did not take long for that new knowledge to be put to awesome use. Protocannons known as bombards were monstrous and crude but devastating. Mons Meg, a siege bombard cast in the Low Countries in 1449, could throw a 300-pound chipped-stone ball a distance of 2 miles at a speed of 700 miles an hour—just shy of the speed of sound. Knocking down castle walls had never been so easy. Within a century of their first appearance in the early 1300s, these new engines of war ousted the English from France, the Moors from Spain and the Byzantine dynasty from Constantinople.<br />In “Firepower,” a sweeping survey of the evolution of the weapons of war from the late Middle Ages through World War II, Paul Lockhart follows the cascading events that the advent of gunpowder set off. In the half millennium after their invention, gunpowder weapons fundamentally changed the way armies trained, fought and organized themselves. These weapons also, in Mr. Lockhart’s argument, upended the very foundations of Western society and political order."
