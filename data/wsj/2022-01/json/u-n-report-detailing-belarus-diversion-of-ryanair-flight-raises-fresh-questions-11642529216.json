    "body": "A new United Nations report on the forced landing by Belarus of a  Ryanair  passenger jet in May raises fresh questions about the veracity of statements by its government about the events, in which it arrested a wanted dissident.<br />The confidential report, released on Monday to countries in the U.N.’s International Civil Aviation Organization and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, presents facts gathered by a special review panel and doesn’t pass judgments. Still, the paper presents a timeline and statements from parties involved that, when taken together, may cast doubt on Belarus’s account of events."
