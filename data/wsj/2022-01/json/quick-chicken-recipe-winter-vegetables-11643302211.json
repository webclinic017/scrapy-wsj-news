    "body": "QUICK-COOKING and deeply flavorful, this recipe for chicken legs cooked with an escabeche of lightly pickled carrots and jalapeños is a go-to for chef Cristina Martinez. The owner of three Philadelphia restaurants, she has limited time to cook at home. “If you have a Mexican pantry, there’s always cumin and jarred jalapeños,” she said. “So, all you need is chicken and some common vegetables for a very good dinner.”<br />The second Slow Food Fast recipe from Ms. Martinez builds flavor at every step. Poaching the chicken legs along with a quartered onion produces a meaty broth. Meanwhile, carrots, onions and pickled jalapeños sauté along with just enough of the brine from the jalapeños’ jar to provide a balanced acidity. Then the partially cooked chicken finishes in the same pan with the vegetable escabeche and some of the chicken’s broth."
