    "body": "In his 1918 arrangement of “Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child” for solo voice and piano, Harry T. Burleigh captures a timeless cry of desolation. It begins with a repetitive pattern in the piano that suggests a weariness of spirit, setting the tone for the coming lyrics. As the piano notes move steadily into the lower register, that weariness grows. Sharp dissonances stab through the musical texture, emphasizing the phrase “A long ways from home.” It’s a demonstration of consummate skill and sensitivity that seems to fulfill the prophecy of Burleigh’s teacher, Antonín Dvořák.<br />Interviewed in 1893, one year into his three-year stay in the U.S., Dvořák contended that “the future music of this country must be founded upon what are called the negro melodies. This must be the real foundation of any serious and original school of composition to be developed in the United States.” In “Dvořák’s Prophecy and the Vexed Fate of Black Classical Music,” Mr. Horowitz—a distinguished cultural historian of American classical music and the author of 10 books on the subject—examines Dvořák’s prophecy and what became of it."
