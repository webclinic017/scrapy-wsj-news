    "body": "The Pentagon announced on Monday that it was placing 8,500 U.S. troops on heightened alert, including troops that could deploy as part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s Response Force. Largely led and manned by Europeans, this force was built for the kind of crisis that Russia is fomenting with its destabilizing buildup around Ukraine.<br />But during the NRF’s nearly 20 years in existence, the alliance has treated it like an antiquarian book—very expensive and rarely taken off the shelf. The U.S. troop alert indicates not only that Washington is shifting from its strategy of restraint but also that it wants to keep NATO at the center of any response to a Russian reinvasion of Ukraine. This makes sense, but the alliance has been unwilling to use the NRF in the past."
