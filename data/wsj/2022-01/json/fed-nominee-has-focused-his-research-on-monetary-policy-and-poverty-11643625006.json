    "body": "WASHINGTON—Economist Philip Jefferson has called on the Federal Reserve to more closely consider how its policies shape the economic well-being of different groups of Americans. If confirmed for a seat on the central bank’s board, he may soon prod it to do so as it prepares to raise interest rates to combat inflation.<br />Mr. Jefferson, one of President Biden’s nominees to the Fed board, has spent much of his career in academia and is now the vice president of academic affairs and dean of faculty at Davidson College. Current and former colleagues of Mr. Jefferson describe him as a consensus-oriented, largely apolitical economist with deep knowledge of monetary policy."
