    "body": "Corporate profits boomed last year, but U.S. companies might have a hard time generating much of an encore.<br />Earnings season has only just begun, and signs suggest fourth-quarter results will be very good. Analysts polled by Refinitiv estimate that earnings per share among companies in the S&P 500 were up 23.1% versus a year earlier.
