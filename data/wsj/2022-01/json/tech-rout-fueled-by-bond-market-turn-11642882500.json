    "body": "Shifts within the bond market are removing a key pillar of support for Wall Streetâ€™s more speculative bets, dragging down major stock indexes as investors flee everything from tech stocks to cryptocurrencies.<br />Spooked in large part by rising bond yields, investors continued to dump stocks last week, extending early-year losses that have taken many off guard with their speed and severity.

Selling also broadened to include sectors such as banking and energy, sending the S&P 500 to its worst stretch of declines since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic."
