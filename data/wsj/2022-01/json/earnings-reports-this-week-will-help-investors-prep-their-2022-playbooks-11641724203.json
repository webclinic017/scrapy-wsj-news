    "body": "Earnings season kicks off this week, the next test for a stock market rattled by the prospect of quicker interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve.<br />The market fell Wednesday on news that the Fed might lift short-term interest rates as soon as March, and it extended its decline throughout the week. The S&P 500, which soared 27% in 2021, fell 1.9% in the first week of the new year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite recorded its worst week since February. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.769%, its highest since January 2020."
