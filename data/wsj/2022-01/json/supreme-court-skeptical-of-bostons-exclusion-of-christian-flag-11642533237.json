    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court appeared doubtful of Boston’s refusal to fly a flag symbolizing Christianity before City Hall after dozens of other third-party flags ran on the pole, with several justices suggesting that local officials read too strictly the constitutional rule against establishment of religion.<br />A city commissioner thought the Christian Flag, a century-old banner consisting of a white field with a red Latin cross in a blue canton, violated the “so-called separation of church and state,” Justice Neil Gorsuch said during Monday arguments. “If that’s mistaken, and if we all agree that’s mistaken,” he said, “what’s left to decide?”"
