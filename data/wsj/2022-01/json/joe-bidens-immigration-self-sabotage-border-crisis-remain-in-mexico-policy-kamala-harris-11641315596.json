    "body": "Chaos at the U.S.-Mexico border is one reason President Biden’s job approval has fallen. Yet he and his designated border czar, Vice President Kamala Harris, keep missing opportunities to do something about it.<br />The latest self-harm is the Administration’s attempt to cancel the Remain in Mexico policy, which allows some categories of migrants seeking U.S. asylum to be sent to Mexico while they wait for hearings on their claims. President Biden tried to scrap the Trump-era policy in June, but federal courts have blocked its cancellation. Last week the Justice Department chose to fight another round, asking the Supreme Court to review the stay on its cancellation."
