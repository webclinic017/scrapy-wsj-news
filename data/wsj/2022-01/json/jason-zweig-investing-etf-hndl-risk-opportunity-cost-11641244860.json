    "body": "In “The Intelligent Investor: The Sorcery That’s Conjuring a 7% Yield” (Exchange, Dec. 18), Jason Zweig does a rigorous job pointing out pros and cons, but he is too polite. The Strategy Shares Nasdaq 7HANDL Index exchange-traded fund (HNDL) works only if the market goes up. It poses higher risk in any market rout because it uses leverage and is 70% bonds.<br />If interest rates rise and stock prices plunge, HNDL might become an ETF whirlpool, with selling and return of capital pushing down its price, which begets more selling."
