    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”Federal prosecutors have recommended that the Justice Department drop criminal charges against a Massachusetts Institute of Technology mechanical engineering professor accused of hiding his China ties, according to people familiar with the matter, as the Biden administration reviews an effort to counter Chinese influence at U.S. universities.<br />Gang Chen was arrested last January on charges of concealing posts he held in China in a grant application he had made to the U.S. Department of Energy in 2017. Justice Department officials have decided to drop the indictment against Mr. Chen, in part based on new information from an Energy Department official, said the people."
