    "body": "The Omicron variant has highlighted a testing divide in American business, where some big companies have secured ample Covid-19 tests and kept workers coming in, while others have struck out and let workers stay home.<br />At  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google, many full-time employees can regularly test themselves or their dependents at home on machines that give results within minutes.  Salesforce.com Inc.  plans to soon roll out an at-home device for employees to test themselves before coming into an office or attending a company gathering. Meanwhile, industrial giant  Honeywell International Inc.,  has supplied employees who are using its offices with at-home rapid tests that they can take daily, part of what Chief Executive Darius Adamczyk calls a “belt and suspenders” approach to safety."
