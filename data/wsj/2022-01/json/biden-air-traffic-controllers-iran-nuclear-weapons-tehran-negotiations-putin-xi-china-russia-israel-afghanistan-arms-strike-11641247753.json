    "body": "Oh where are striking air-traffic controllers when Joe Biden needs them?<br />In 1981, Ronald Reagan, like Mr. Biden today, was an older president dismissed by many as a lightweight. That all changed Aug. 3, when the nation’s air-traffic controllers declared an illegal strike. Instead of negotiating, Reagan gave the striking government workers 48 hours to return to their jobs. Those who didn’t—11,345 in all—were fired."
