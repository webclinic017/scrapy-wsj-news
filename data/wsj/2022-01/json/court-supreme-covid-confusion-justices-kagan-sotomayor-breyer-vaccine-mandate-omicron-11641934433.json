    "body": "While not as awful as some said, the Supreme Court’s performance during oral arguments over the Biden vaccine mandate for private workplaces was hardly the Court’s finest hour. Half way around the world, Australia’s big national newspaper took notice with the headline, “Top US judges slip up on facts of pandemic.”<br />Some slams were unfair. Justice Gorsuch didn’t say hundreds of thousands people die of the flu every year, but hundreds, thousands. Justice Breyer merely misspoke when he said 750 million Americans were testing positive each day. Justice Sotomayor didn’t quite slur unvaccinated Americans as “virus spewing machines.”"
