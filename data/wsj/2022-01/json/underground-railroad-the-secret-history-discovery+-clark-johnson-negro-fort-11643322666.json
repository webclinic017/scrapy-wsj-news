    "body": "The Underground Railroad is hardly an obscure subject—books, dissertations, novels and even TV miniseries have been devoted to it. But many of the details remain mysterious—and for good reason: “Nobody wanted to write it down,” we’re reminded during “Underground Railroad: The Secret History,” a series about new technology being used to make a near-mythic episode in American history more concrete.<br />Traditionally, the Underground Railroad is known as the network of escape routes and safe houses used by enslaved people to flee north to free states and Canada. “The Secret History,” perhaps in an effort to establish itself as a fresh take on a well-known story, begins by going south—to Florida, where fugitives and indigenous people co-existed in autonomous communities; to Mexico,, where slavery was illegal; and to Texas, where the enslaved also fled, at least until 1836 (when Texas became independent of Mexico, and slavery was re-established)."
