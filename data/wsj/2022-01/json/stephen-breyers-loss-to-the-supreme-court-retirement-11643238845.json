    "body": "The news leak that Justice Stephen Breyer plans to retire at the end of the current Supreme Court term won’t change the balance of power on the High Court. But it does mean the loss of a pragmatic liberal, with no guarantee that his successor will have the same restraint or principles.<br />Appointed by Bill Clinton in 1994, the 83-year-old Justice Breyer is the second-longest serving member of the Court after Justice Clarence Thomas. Like many liberals of his generation, he is an institutionalist who believes in the promise of the Constitution and incremental social improvement."
