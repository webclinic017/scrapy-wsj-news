    "body": "LONDON–A British court allowed Julian Assange to take his appeal against  extradition to the U.S. to the U.K. Supreme Court, marking another setback in Washington’s yearslong pursuit of the WikiLeaks founder on espionage charges.<br />In a ruling Monday, Lord Chief Justice Ian Burnett and Lord Justice Timothy Holroyde permitted Mr. Assange to ask the Supreme Court to consider a narrow legal question that could open the door to a full appeal. The question relates to a package of U.S. assurances over Mr. Assange’s treatment if he were extradited."
