    "body": "The Economist predicts “2022 will be the year of the worker.” Interest in organizing is “infectiously spreading from workplace to workplace,” the New Republic claims, concluding: “America is in the midst of a dramatic labor resurgence.” New data  from the Bureau of Labor Statistics throw cold water on these predictions.<br />The annual BLS report on union membership released last week shows that unions lost nearly a quarter-million members in 2021, with private-sector membership dropping to a historic low of 6.1%. Even in retail and healthcare, which labor organizers targeted over pandemic-related safety concerns, union membership declined in 2021 from 2020."
