    "body": "THAILAND, one of the few Asian countries currently open to American tourists, has an unusual entry protocol. The name itself conjures fun and sun: Phuket Sandbox.<br />Fully vaccinated visitors are allowed into the country—once a few administrative hurdles are cleared—but must first fly to Phuket, Thailand’s largest island or, as of Jan. 11, to one of three other seaside provinces, and stay at one of several designated hotels, including luxury resorts. Those hurdles include submitting paperwork for a visa and certificate of entry, showing proof of a negative RT-PCR test and paying for Covid-19 insurance (a minimum coverage of $50,000 is required)."
