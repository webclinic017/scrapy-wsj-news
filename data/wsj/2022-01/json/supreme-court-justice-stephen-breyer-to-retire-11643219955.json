    "body": "WASHINGTON—Justice Stephen Breyer plans to retire at the end of the current Supreme Court term, giving President Biden an opportunity to shore up the court’s liberal wing for decades to come and deliver on his promise to nominate the court’s first Black woman.<br />The justice’s intention was confirmed by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and two other people familiar with the matter. Senate Democrats said they would move quickly to fill the vacancy created by Justice Breyer, a 1994 Clinton appointee who is 83 years old."
