    "body": "Former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin tested positive for Covid-19, delaying a trial in her defamation lawsuit against the  New York Times .  Jury selection was scheduled to begin Monday in Manhattan federal court.<br />U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said he was postponing the trial until Feb. 3. The proceeding won’t be further delayed if Ms. Palin, who is unvaccinated, continues to test positive, so long as she is asymptomatic, he said. If Ms. Palin is experiencing symptoms, the judge said he would require her to meet with the court’s physician to assess their severity."
