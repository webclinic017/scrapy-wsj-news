    "body": "Microsoft  is making a big wager with its record-setting proposal to buy videogame giant  Activision  Blizzard, but fears that the $69 billion deal will be spiked by regulators are probably overblown.<br />Those fears have kept Activision’s stock at a significant discount to the deal price since the proposed transaction was announced last week. The shares closed Wednesday at $78.78—17% below the $95 cash price Microsoft is offering. That is even steeper than the 13% discount reflected in Activision’s closing price the day the deal was announced."
