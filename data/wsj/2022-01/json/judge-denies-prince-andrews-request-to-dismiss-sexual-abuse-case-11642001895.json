    "body": "A U.S. federal judge denied Prince Andrew’s request to dismiss a lawsuit accusing him of sexually abusing a teenager, dealing a blow to the royal’s efforts to stop litigation alleging his ties to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.<br />The ruling, which came late Tuesday, means the litigation can proceed and sets the stage for a possible civil trial in a federal court in New York in the fall."
