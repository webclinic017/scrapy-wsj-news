    "body": "Airline investors are hoping that this pandemic turns endemic, but that could come with some nasty symptoms, too.<br />On Thursday,  Delta Air Lines  said that it had lost $408 million in the final quarter of 2021. Despite the negative impact of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, the numbers were still better than analysts had been expecting. More importantly, the Atlanta-based firm forecasts revenues of between 72% and 76% of 2019 levels for this quarter, compared with 74% the previous one. This isn’t the hoped-for bumper holiday season, but it is far from a derailment of the travel recovery."
