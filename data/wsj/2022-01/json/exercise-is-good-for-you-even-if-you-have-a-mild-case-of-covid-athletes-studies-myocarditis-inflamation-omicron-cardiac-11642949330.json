    "body": "To exercise with Covid or not—that’s the question some fitness buffs are asking. The American College of Sports Medicine has suggested people under 50 who experience mild or no symptoms to rest for at least seven to 10 days after testing positive. Their recommendation appears to be motivated by the concern that even a mild Covid-19 infection may damage the heart and potentially cause sudden death during physical exertion.<br />There’s little evidence to support this recommendation. Because exercise boosts the immune system, it may even help people bounce back faster from Covid."
