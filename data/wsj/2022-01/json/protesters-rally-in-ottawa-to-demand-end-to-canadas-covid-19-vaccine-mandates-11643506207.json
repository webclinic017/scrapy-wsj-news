    "body": "OTTAWA—Tens of thousands of protesters gathered Saturday outside Canada’s main parliament buildings, clogging up main arteries in the capital’s downtown, as they demanded Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rescind all economic restrictions and vaccine mandates tied to the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The protesters, organized by a group of truck drivers from across the country, have vowed to remain in central Ottawa until Mr. Trudeau abandons restrictions. The main organizers, a group called Freedom Convoy 2022, said Mr. Trudeau and his Liberal government crossed a line by imposing this month a vaccine mandate on Canadian truckers who ferry goods across the U.S.-Canada border."
