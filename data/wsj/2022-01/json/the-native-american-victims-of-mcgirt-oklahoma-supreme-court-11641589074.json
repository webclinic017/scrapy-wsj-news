    "body": "Crystal Jensen had finished a shower one morning in 2019 when she noticed movement out of the corner of her eye. “I didn’t have any clothes on,” Ms. Jensen says. “And there was a phone up to the window.” Her male neighbor, Tobie Munroe, was eventually charged with a felony peeping Tom offense.<br />It was dropped last year due to Ms. Jensen’s heritage. She has a small amount of Cherokee blood, and she lives within the historical boundaries of the Cherokee Nation. Under the Supreme Court’s wrongheaded 2020 McGirt ruling, the state can no longer prosecute such crimes in what’s now considered Indian country. The feds could perhaps bring a case, but they’re deluged. Ms. Jensen has heard “not a word” from them."
