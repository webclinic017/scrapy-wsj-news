    "body": "David Arfin, a pioneer of rooftop solar power in the U.S., is developing a dozen basketball court-sized electric battery sites in New York City with a recent investment from  Carlyle Group Inc.<br />Carlyle bought a stake in Mr. Arfinâ€™s company, NineDot Energy, as it expands into the market for large-scale electricity storage, a growing area of interest for money managers. The private-equity giant spent over $100 million in December on separate investments in NineDot and Fermata Energy, a supplier of technology for parked electric vehicles to pump power from their batteries into local electricity grids."
