    "body": "Kevin Kosar’s review of “First Class” by Christopher Shaw (Bookshelf, Jan. 14) makes good suggestions on how to reduce costs at the post office. But he doesn’t mention the elephant in the room: pensions.<br />My grandmother worked for the U.S. Postal Service for 18 years and retired as Post Master in 1979, at the age of 65. When she retired she was making $12,000 a year. She died a couple of years ago at the age of 105, collecting a pension for 40 years. Because the Postal Service gives annual cost-of-living adjustments to its retirees, her pension went up every year. Her pension was more than $50,000 a year when she died."
