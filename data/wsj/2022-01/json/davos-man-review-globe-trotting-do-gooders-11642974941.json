    "body": "In 1971 a German economist named Klaus Schwab convened the first meeting of what would become the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Mr. Schwab wanted business executives, government officials and nonprofit leaders to discuss his idea of “stakeholder capitalism”: the concept that corporate managers have a duty to pursue the interests not only of shareholders, but of stakeholders. What’s a stakeholder? Basically, it’s any individual or group allegedly affected by the company’s decisions.<br />The idea caught on. Fifty years later, around 3,000 billionaires and millionaires, heads of state, rock stars, and hangers-on flock to the annual gathering. (The 2021 Forum was held remotely, and this year’s meeting has been delayed until spring.) The language of stakeholder capitalism permeates politics and economics. Mr. Schwab did more than build an institution. He created a social type: the globe-trotting, well-connected, extremely wealthy do-gooder whom the late political scientist Samuel P. Huntington called “Davos Man.”"
