    "body": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand—The deafening boom that followed the violent eruption of an undersea volcano near Tonga acted like a warning bell for island residents to flee inland, a response that likely reduced the death toll when tsunami waves crashed the coastline not long after.<br />Tongan officials said the Pacific nation’s practice of running tsunami drills had also played a part in saving lives, even as the island archipelago sustained extensive damage to property, with the majority of houses on some islands being completely destroyed. The confirmed death toll from Saturday’s explosion and tsunami, which was felt as far away as the U.S. West Coast and Japan, so far is three."
