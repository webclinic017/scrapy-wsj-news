    "body": "Most of us in our 20s and 30s are familiar with the rhythms of friend-group life changes. First, people find their long-term relationships, and in each case you hear all the dish about who this new person is, and you vet them to make sure they’re a fit match for your beloved friend. Then, the couple moves in together, so you help assemble new furniture and attend the housewarming party. After that, maybe there’s a wedding—or, in the past couple of years, a Zoom ceremony—and you clink Champagne and make teary-eyed toasts.<br />Everyone knows what comes next: Wait a couple of years, and your calendar will start filling up with invitations to baby showers and sip and sees, and you find yourself shopping for teensy shoes and picture books and other gifts appropriate for new parents."
