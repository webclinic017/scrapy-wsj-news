    "body": "Tim Roth brings quick intelligence and coiled energy to any character he plays. But “Sundown,” which was written and directed by the Mexican filmmaker Michel Franco, presents him with a new challenge—how to dramatize detachment. The answer, it turns out, is with more difficulty than you can or may want to imagine. (The film is playing in theaters in New York and Los Angeles, with wider distribution to follow.)<br />Mr. Roth is Neil Bennett, a man of great wealth and the brother of British industrialist Alice Bennett (Charlotte Gainsbourg). On vacation in Acapulco with his sister and her two children, Neil is content to soak up the sun in a serene tropical version of the good life until an explosion of violence tears that serenity—and the family’s security—to tatters. At that point Neil checks out. Not just out of his luxurious villa, though he does that too, but seemingly out of his life. That is also the point when Mr. Franco’s film becomes a mystery, one that turns on the question of the hero’s motives. Why does he flee from responsibility instead of rising to it? Is he crazy? Has he conspired in a crime? It’s not a criminal offense to have an affair with a lovely local, as Neil does. (Her name is Bernice, and she’s played by Iazua Larios.) Under the circumstances, though, it’s certainly bizarre."
