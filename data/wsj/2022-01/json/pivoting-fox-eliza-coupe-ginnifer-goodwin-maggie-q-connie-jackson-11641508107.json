    "body": "All sitcoms have a central joke, a kind of trunk that keeps them stable and erect through their seasonal lifespans and on which gags are hung like ornaments. At first blush, “Pivoting,” which makes its debut Sunday on Fox, seems based on the barely arguable point that women are asked to do far more than is possible, men are asked to do far less, and the math is somehow hilarious.<br />And yet the half-hour comedy, created by Liz Astrof and starring Eliza Coupe, Ginnifer Goodwin and Maggie Q, turns out to be about something a bit more complicated, even profound, and potentially funnier in the long run: people resisting their natural inclinations and temperaments in order to be “better” people. Better for whom? That’s the question."
