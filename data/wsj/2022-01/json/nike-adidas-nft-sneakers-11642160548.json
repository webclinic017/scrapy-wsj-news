    "body": "Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are a lot like sneaker drops: They come in limited quantities, depend on sky-high demand and stir speculative crazes in the resale market. It should come as no surprise, then, that  Nike ,  Adidas and  Under Armour  have dipped their toes into the market. Can they hit the ground running?<br />NFTs are digital assets—art, videos, anything that can exist digitally—that are tradable but not “fungible,” meaning they are unique and can’t be exchanged for an identical asset. A dollar or barrel of oil is fungible, a piece of art or a home isn’t. For brands like Nike or Adidas, NFTs could take the form of a collectible digital sneaker or one that an owner might actually wear in the virtual realm—say, in a video game or in the metaverse. In some cases, an NFT comes with both the digital shoe and the right to a future delivery of a real one, serving as a kind of tradable ticket for the physical product."
