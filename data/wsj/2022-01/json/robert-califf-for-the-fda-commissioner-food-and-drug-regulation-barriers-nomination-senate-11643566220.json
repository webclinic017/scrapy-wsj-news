    "body": "President Biden hasn’t often stood up to the left with his regulatory nominees, but he did in selecting respected cardiologist Robert Califf to run the Food and Drug Administration. Yet now the Administration is leaving its nominee out on a political limb.<br />A Senate committee this month backed Dr. Califf, 13-8. But five Democratic Senators, including West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, have signaled opposition partly because of his work with pharmaceutical companies, which means he will need GOP votes to be confirmed. Pro-life groups are mobilizing against him too."
