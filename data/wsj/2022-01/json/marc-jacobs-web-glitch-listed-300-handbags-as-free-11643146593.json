    "body": "Some Marc Jacobs customers temporarily snagged pricey handbags at a 100% discount Tuesday morning due to what the luxury brand called an “inadvertent error.” The company canceled the orders after some customers bought multiple bags and spread word about the glitch on social media.<br />Chyna Dandridge, 24 years old, said she bought “The Year of the Tiger” mini jacquard tote bag and was only charged the cost of shipping. The handbag was listed at $325 on marcjacobs.com when Ms. Dandridge added it to her shopping cart, but the website automatically applied a discount for the full purchase price when she checked out."
