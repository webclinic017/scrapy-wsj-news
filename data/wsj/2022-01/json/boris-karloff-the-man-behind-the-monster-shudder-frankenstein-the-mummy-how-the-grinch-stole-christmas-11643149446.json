    "body": "If there were an actor’s Mount Rushmore of American horror cinema, it would include Lon Chaney, Bela Lugosi, maybe Vincent Price, and without a doubt the subject of “Boris Karloff: The Man Behind the Monster.” In Thomas Hamilton’s not-quite-adoring but hugely affectionate biographical documentary, Karloff emerges as a very decent man, whose job was to terrify millions. And whose often-startling filmography is worth a revisit.<br />It’s no coincidence then that the horror service Shudder is using “Boris Karloff” to kick off a February-long showcase of Karloff films—not just the 1931 “Frankenstein,” in which the actor forever defined Mary Shelley’s Monster in the public imagination, but the magnificently eccentric “Bride of Frankenstein.” Other new additions to Shudder’s Karloff Collection are “Son of Frankenstein,” “House of Frankenstein,” “The Mummy” and the scandalously perverse “The Black Cat.” (They join Mario Bava’s “Black Sabbath” from the early ’60s and James Whale’s “The Old Dark House,” an underappreciated gem in the celebrated catalog of ’30s Universal horror.)"
