    "body": "That was some oral argument at the Supreme Court Friday over President Biden’s vaccine mandates. The questions from the Justices don’t bode well in particular for the mandate on private employers, and one clue came from Chief Justice John Roberts.<br />The Chief brought up a re-tweet last year by White House chief of staff Ronald Klain hailing the mandate as the “ultimate work-around.” “I mean, this has been referred to the approach as a work-around. And I’m wondering what it is you’re trying to work around?” the Chief asked, adding it is “hard to argue” that Congress has given such “free rein” to OSHA, the agency that promulgated the mandate."
