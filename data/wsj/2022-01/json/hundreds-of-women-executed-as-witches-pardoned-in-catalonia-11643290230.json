    "body": "Catalonia’s parliament has passed a resolution to pardon hundreds of women who were tortured and executed as witches between the 15th and 18th centuries, some 300 years after the first victims of the Salem witch trials were exonerated.<br />Historians say the bulk of witchcraft executions in Spain took place in the Northeast region, where some of Europe’s first witch trials were held, in 1471. Wednesday’s vote, backed by pro-independence and left-leaning parties in the regional legislature, came on the back of exhaustive research by a history journal, Sapiens, and will rehabilitate more than 700 women."
