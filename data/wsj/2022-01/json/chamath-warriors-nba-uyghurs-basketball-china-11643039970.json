    "body": "Regarding Daniel Henninger’s column “Progressive to Uyghurs: Drop Dead” (Wonder Land, Jan. 20): The plight of the Uyghurs finally hit the front page when Chamath Palihapitiya, minority owner of the Golden State Warriors basketball team, admitted he couldn’t care less about them. Early last week my workout pals asked, “What’s a Uyghur?” A few days later, they were all over it.<br />The NBA and its licensees rely on the Chinese government for a growing share of its revenue. One cannot expect Mr. Palihapitiya to bite the hand that feeds his players. Indeed, Chinese money and influence are embedded in most aspects of our economy. What Mr. Henninger calls “progressive isolationism” is really a lack of will to see beyond the bottom line."
