    "body": "Meghan Cox Gurdon’s review of Jack Zipes’s new translation of “Bambi: A Life in the Woods” (Books, Jan. 15) does an injustice to my grandfather, Whittaker Chambers, and his 1928 translation of the novel.<br />Chambers’s translations neither shows “softness” nor tries to “mitigate” the “totalitarian oppression of innocents.” In 1928, the polyglot Chambers was hearing of European horrors from Jews and other minorities. Contrary to the description offered in the review, he was also drifting out of the Communist Party by 1928, disgusted by its infighting. (Also, Chambers was no “secret communist.” He was one of the few who registered in his own name.)"
