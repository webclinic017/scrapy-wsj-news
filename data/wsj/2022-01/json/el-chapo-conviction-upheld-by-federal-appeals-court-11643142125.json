    "body": "A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld the conviction of Mexican drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera, rejecting claims of juror misconduct and arguments that his pretrial treatment in jail hampered his defense.<br />The ruling, by a three-judge panel on the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, means Mr. Guzmán will continue serving a life sentence. A federal jury in Brooklyn found him guilty in 2019 of 10 criminal counts in connection with leading the Sinaloa drug cartel."
