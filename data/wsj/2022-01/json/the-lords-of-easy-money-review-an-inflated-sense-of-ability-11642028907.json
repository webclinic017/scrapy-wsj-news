    "body": "You don’t ordinarily turn to a book about the Federal Reserve for comedy, and for the most part Christopher Leonard’s “The Lords of Easy Money: How the Federal Reserve Broke the American Economy” stays true to its genre. Mr. Leonard does, however, include one pointedly humorous moment that sheds light on so much of his subject matter.<br />The joke comes when he recounts an exchange among policy makers during a 2012 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The committee was in the throes of a monthslong argument about whether and how to expand the Fed’s easy-money policies. Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed, chimed in with a warning. Texas Instruments, a major employer in his district, wasn’t treating existing Fed policies such as near-zero interest rates as a spur to investment and job creation. The company was merely reconfiguring its balance sheet toward cheaper debt financing and away from equity funding. This ran counter to the Fed’s theories about how its decisions filter through to the Main Street economy. To which Chairman Ben Bernanke replied: “President Fisher . . . I do want to urge you not to overweight the macroeconomic opinions of private-sector people who are not trained in economics.”"
