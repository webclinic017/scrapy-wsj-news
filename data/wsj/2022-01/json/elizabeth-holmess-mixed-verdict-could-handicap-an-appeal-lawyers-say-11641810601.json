    "body": "Elizabeth Holmes’s conviction on four counts of fraud for intentionally deceiving Theranos Inc. investors is far from the end of the startup founder’s legal fight.<br />Instead, the Jan. 3 verdict is expected to kick off a new round of legal maneuvering that will give her lawyers several chances to clear her name, and to continue to deploy what legal observers say is an intransigent defense strategy that became the team’s signature during the monthslong trial. One tactic will likely involve requesting that Ms. Holmes remain free on bail for the entirety of the appeal process, which could take years."
