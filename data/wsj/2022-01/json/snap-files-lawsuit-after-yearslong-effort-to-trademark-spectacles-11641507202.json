    "body": "Snap  Inc.,  the parent company of the social-media app Snapchat, has sued the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office over its rejection to trademark the word “spectacles” for the company’s wearable smart glasses.<br />The complaint comes after a November opinion by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board of the USPTO said that the word “spectacles” is generic, and that Snap “has not acquired distinctiveness” to qualify for a trademark of the word."
