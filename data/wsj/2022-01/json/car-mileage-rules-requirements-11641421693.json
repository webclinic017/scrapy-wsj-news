    "body": "Regarding Jonathan Lesser’s op-ed “The EPA’s Mileage Standards Are a Stealth Electric-Vehicle Mandate” (Dec. 29): Mileage requirements have resulted in better cars. Engines are smaller and more efficient, and transmissions are better at getting performance out of them, with six to 10 gears now common, or continuously variable transmissions in common and well-reviewed cars.<br />The complaints smell like those from the industry in the 1970s, claiming that removing lead from gas would result in engine failures, or that the mileage requirements back then, when cars got 12 miles a gallon, would result in unreliable, underpowered vehicles. Sadly, the first cars with catalytic converters were indeed garbage. But according to U.S. News & World Report, there are now 30 cars under $30,000 that do zero to 60 mph at speeds the Ferrari 250 GTO couldn’t crack."
