    "body": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to win a second term leading the central bank but must first face a grilling Tuesday at his Senate confirmation hearing after pivoting recently to tighten policy to combat inflation.<br />When annual inflation readings began to rise above 4% last summer, Mr. Powell told lawmakers that it would be a mistake to raise interest rates in response to one-time increases in certain prices, like for air travel and used cars, whose prices were surging due the bumpy reopening of the U.S. economy."
