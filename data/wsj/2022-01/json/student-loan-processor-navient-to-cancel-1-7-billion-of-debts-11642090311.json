    "body": "A former unit of student loan giant Sallie Mae said it would cancel $1.7 billion in private student debt for about 66,000 borrowers to resolve claims that it engaged in deceptive lending practices.<br />Navient  Corp. , a student loan servicer that split off from Sallie Mae in 2014, agreed to the sum in a settlement with 40 state attorneys general. The loans are private loans, so the losses will be covered by Navientâ€™s investors rather than the federal government."
