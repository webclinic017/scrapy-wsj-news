    "body": "Last week Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and four of his Republican colleagues voted at the committee markup to send Democratic Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s American Innovation and Choice Online Act to the Senate floor. This bill would reshape antitrust law radically while making drastic changes to online commerce and the internet.<br />One of the bill’s Republican co-sponsors, Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana—echoing Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Alex Padilla of California and Chris Coons of Delaware—said before Thursday’s committee vote that the bill would need serious revisions or he wouldn’t support bringing it to floor. Mr. Kennedy, like many Republicans, saw the trap for conservatives that Ms. Klobuchar is setting—and stepped into it anyway. With the hope of curbing Big Tech’s heavy-handed “content moderation” censorship of conservatives, many Republicans still are supporting this badly written bill, which promises chaos for markets, disruption for consumers, and socialism for American business."
