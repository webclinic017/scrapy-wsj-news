    "body": "Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkovwarned in a Jan. 13 television interview that his government wouldn’t rule out the deployment of “military assets” to Venezuela and Cuba if the U.S. continues to defend Ukrainian sovereignty. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan dismissed the comment as “bluster.”<br />Pundits—responding as the Kremlin no doubt had hoped—briefly suggested the risk of a 1962 Cuban missile crisis redux. That was dumb, and Mr. Sullivan was right to treat the remark as a distraction."
