    "body": "Puerto Rico has completed the biggest public-debt restructuring in American history, whittling $33 billion of obligations down to $7 billion over the past five years and rescuing its pension system. To put this in perspective, Puerto Rico resolved three times as much debt as Detroit did in its bankruptcy and more than 10 times Detroit’s unfunded pension liability. “It is the court’s hope and expectation,” Judge Laura Taylor Swain said after approving the restructuring, “that the confirmation of the plan marks the beginning of Puerto Rico’s brightest chapter.”<br />The most innovative features of the plan of adjustment seek to ensure that repayment never becomes unaffordable. The recoveries of many creditors are based in part on a contingent-value instrument linked to sales-tax revenue. Only if the revenue is higher than projected—and thus, Puerto Rico’s economy is doing well—will creditors receive a higher recovery."
