    "body": "Tom Rogan’s op-ed “Is Germany a Reliable Ally? Nein” (Jan. 24) and your editorial “Deterrence Message to Moscow” (Jan. 25) correctly highlight why NATO’s Ukraine strategy likely will fail. There will be two owners for this failure.<br />The first is the Biden administration, because of its weak response to Russia’s aggressive behavior. The second, perhaps more important owner, is NATO’s European member states."
