    "body": "F.H. Buckley tells millennials that we are soft and easily offended (“Millennials Are the Silencing Generation” (op-ed, Jan. 3). While a few younger millennials require safe spaces and promote cancel culture, who are the college administrators creating these safe spaces and the business leaders placating the cancel mobs? Boomers. Shouldn’t they know better? Our parents gave us participation trophies; we didn’t ask for them. Mr. Buckley claims correctly that “Saturday Night Live” is no longer funny, but isn’t Lorne Michaels still in control? Boomers run every major institution in this country. Don’t blame us for a society you no longer like.<br />Millennials are more resilient than they are given credit. We came of age during 9/11, graduated during the Great Recession and have now weathered a global pandemic. We’re not ungrateful to the boomer generation, but you can get off our lawn."
