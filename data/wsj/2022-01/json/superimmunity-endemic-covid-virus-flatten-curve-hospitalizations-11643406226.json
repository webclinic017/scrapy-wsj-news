    "body": "In “Herd Immunity Is Over—Long Live Superimmunity” (op-ed, Jan. 18), Allysia Finley presents an excellent discussion of the possibility that “people who have been vaccinated or previously infected will develop superimmunity,” and that the SARS-CoV-2 virus will become “annoying but rarely deadly or disruptive.”<br />There are, however, several important caveats to those speculations. First, the price we are already paying for the possible progression of Covid-19 to endemic, rather than pandemic, is horrific. Hospitalizations are still running high."
