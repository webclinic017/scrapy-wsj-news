    "body": "Each new year begins full of hope for this company and its clients, but few were as disappointing as 2021.<br />WW International ,  the dieting specialist formerly known as Weight Watchers, had millions of potential new customers a year ago who had packed on their “Covid 15” earlier in the pandemic.
