    "body": "IN SEPTEMBER I traveled to Munich to drive two vehicles that are hugely consequential for  BMW : the iX, a battery-electric midsize luxury SUV; and our guest this week, the i4 M50 sedan, an electric—but otherwise nearly indistinguishable—iteration of the well-groomed 4 Series Gran Coupe.<br />After a couple hundred kilometers soaring across Bavarian fairyland, here’s my capsule review: glorious. Not only that. Sweet, swift, swank, swell, fast as hell, hushed as a chapel, cool as marble, minty fresh. With its front and rear e-motors providing a digitally mastered 536 hp to the wheels, the i4 M50 accelerates like Derby Lane’s electric rabbit—0-60 mph in 3.7 seconds. But even at Autobahn speeds, just ask; the upwelling torque (max 586 lb-ft) will mush you lovingly into the seat."
