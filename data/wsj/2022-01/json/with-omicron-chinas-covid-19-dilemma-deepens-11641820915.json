    "body": "The hypercontagious Omicron Covid-19 variant has its first toehold in China: The country confirmed its first local transmissions over the weekend in the northern city of Tianjin. A public health official told state media that the virus appears to have spread for at least three viral generations in the city.<br />China successfully faced down the fast-spreading Delta variant in 2021, but at a high cost.

Does that mean an even bigger hit to growth?"
