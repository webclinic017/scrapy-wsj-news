    "body": "Democrats have framed their voting-rights legislation as a “battle for the soul of America.” President Biden last week said that “the right to vote and to have that vote counted is democracy’s threshold liberty.” But what about the right to a real choice?<br />The Democratic Party sued to remove 2020 Green Party presidential candidate Howie Hawkins from the ballot in Pennsylvania over a technicality; the state Supreme Court, whose members are chosen through partisan elections, ruled in the Democrats’ favor along party lines. Democrats also got the Greens removed from the ballot in Wisconsin because vice-presidential candidate Angela Walker, a Milwaukee native, listed two addresses on her ballot petition. She said she moved during the signature-gathering process."
