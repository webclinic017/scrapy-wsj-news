    "body": "This past week  Intel  announced that it will build its new, $20 billion state-of-the-art chip plant near Columbus, Ohio. The company says that the location could eventually expand into a $100 billion complex with as many as eight fabrication facilities. As Intel CEO Jeff Gelsinger put it, “We helped to establish the Silicon Valley, now we’re going to do the Silicon Heartland.”<br />The plan points to a broader shift away from the country’s predominantly bicoastal tech economy, anchored in the San Francisco Bay area and along the Amtrak Acela corridor between Boston and Washington, D.C. It is distinct from the pandemic-induced shifts of people with transportable high-tech and service jobs to places with more affordable housing and outdoor space—such as Sunbelt cities and rural “zoom towns” like Jackson Hole, Wyo., Bozeman, Mont., and the Hudson Valley north of New York City."
