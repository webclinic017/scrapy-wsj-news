    "body": "SEOUL—North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attended his first weapons launch in nearly two years, observing what Pyongyang described as the final test of a new hypersonic missile that is a top priority.<br />Sporting a leather jacket and peering through binoculars, Mr. Kim watched a missile hit a target roughly 620 miles away, after making a “glide jump flight” and making a “corkscrew” maneuver, according to a Wednesday state-media report. His younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, was also present for the test."
