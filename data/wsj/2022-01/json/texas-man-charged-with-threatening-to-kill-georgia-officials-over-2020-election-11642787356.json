    "body": "WASHINGTON—Federal prosecutors have charged a Texas man with threatening to kill Georgia government officials, in the first case brought by a Justice Department task force created to combat crimes against election workers.<br />Chad Christopher Stark wrote in a Jan. 5, 2021, message on Craigslist that it was “time to put a bullet” in one official before moving on to “local and federal corrupt judges,” according to an indictment unsealed Friday, in which the names of the targeted officials are redacted. He offered $10,000 to those who would join him, prosecutors said."
