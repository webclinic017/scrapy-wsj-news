    "body": "Three U.S. senators sent a letter Friday to companies that develop online degree programs for universities, raising concerns about aggressive student-recruiting tactics and other policies that they said might contribute to rising college debt levels.<br />The senators—Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), and Tina Smith (D., Minn.)—wrote to eight online-program management companies, including 2U Inc., whose relationship with the University of Southern California’s social work school was the subject of a Wall Street Journal investigation published in November."
