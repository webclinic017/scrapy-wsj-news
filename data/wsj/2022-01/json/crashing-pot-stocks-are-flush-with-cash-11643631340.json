    "body": "Cannabis stocks are on a major downer. The only good news is that U.S. pot companies are better able to cope with low valuations than they were during the last crunch.<br />The selloff in riskier stocks has hit U.S. marijuana businesses hard. The  AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF ,  one of the larger funds tracking the sector, is down 22% this year even after a poor 2021. The fund lost almost one-third of its value last year as hopes of marijuana reform in Washington faded."
