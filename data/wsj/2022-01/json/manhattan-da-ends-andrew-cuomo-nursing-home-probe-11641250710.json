    "body": "The Manhattan district attorney’s office has closed its investigation into how the administration of former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo handled Covid-19 in nursing homes, a lawyer who represented the administration said Monday.<br />Defense attorney Elkan Abramowitz, who served as outside counsel for Mr. Cuomo’s executive chamber, said he was contacted Monday by the head of the Manhattan district attorney’s elder-care unit. “I was told that after a thorough investigation—as we have said all along—there was no evidence to suggest that any laws were broken,” Mr. Abramowitz said in a statement."
