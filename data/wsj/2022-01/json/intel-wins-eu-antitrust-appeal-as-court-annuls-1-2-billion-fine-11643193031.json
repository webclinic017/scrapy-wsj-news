    "body": "BRUSSELS— Intel Corp.  won an annulment of a $1.2 billion fine issued by the European Union’s antitrust regulator more than a decade ago over allegations the microchip producer had used its commercial power to squeeze out a competitor.<br />The court’s decision is a blow to the European Commission, the bloc’s main antitrust regulator, which is seeking to expand its reach through new regulations and a reinterpretation of its existing powers. Lawyers said a ruling in favor of Intel could put a greater burden on the commission in pursuing some antitrust cases."
