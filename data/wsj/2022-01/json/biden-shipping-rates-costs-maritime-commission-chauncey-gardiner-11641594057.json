    "body": "In “Waiting With Biden” (Business World, Dec. 29), Holman Jenkins wrongly states that the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) refutes President Biden about what has caused the increased cost for shipping containerized cargo. While it is true that Covid-related demand has far outstripped ocean capacity, that does not mean the FMC has ruled that “nefarious” acts on the part of shipping lines have played no role. In fact, the FMC is pursuing enforcement investigations involving three ocean carriers.<br />This is in addition to other actions taken in response to escalating shipping costs, such as investigating carrier-added fees and surcharges, auditing compliance with the rule on detention and demurrage and adjudicating complaints brought by shippers."
