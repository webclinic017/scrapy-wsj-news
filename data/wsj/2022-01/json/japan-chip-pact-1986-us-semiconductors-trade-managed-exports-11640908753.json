    "body": "I disagree with Chad P. Brown’s analysis of the causes and result of U.S. negotiations with Japan on semiconductors in 1986 (“The False Allure of Managed Trade,” Review, Dec. 18). At the time, I was counselor to the commerce secretary and a lead U.S. negotiator on the issue. Not only did the U.S. not convince “the Japanese chip industry to reduce its sales globally,” we never asked.<br />We made two requests of Japan. First, greater market access to the tightly closed Japanese market, in which the Japanese government had instructed chip buyers to “buy Japanese.” Second, an end to the chronic, illegal dumping (selling abroad at prices below those in the home market or below cost) of chips by Japanese makers in the U.S. market."
