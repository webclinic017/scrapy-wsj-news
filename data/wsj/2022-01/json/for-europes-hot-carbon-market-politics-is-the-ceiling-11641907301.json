    "body": "European Union carbon credits aren’t so much a commodity as a political tool. That has underpinned a stunning rally over the past year, but it also caps the market’s potential for financial speculation.<br />The EU’s emission trading scheme, or ETS, is the world’s largest regulated market for carbon allowances. Annually, European polluters in selected industries, notably power production, must redeem a credit for each metric ton of carbon dioxide they emit. A diminishing number of allowances are granted with the rest being auctioned off. Initially market prices languished, but have been rising since a 2018 reform. On Tuesday, they traded at 82 euros, equivalent to roughly $93, up from just €34 a year ago."
