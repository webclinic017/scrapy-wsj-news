    "body": "An indigenous community in western Canada said Tuesday it found what it believes could be 93 unmarked graves near a former boarding school for indigenous children, following a series of similar discoveries near other former schools over the past year.<br />The Williams Lake First Nation, located in the province of British Columbia, said the possible graves were found at the site of St. Josephâ€™s Mission Residential School, which operated for about 90 years before closing in 1981. Researchers used several methods to conduct the search, including a technology known as ground-penetrating radar, which looks for changes underground to identify possible grave shafts."
