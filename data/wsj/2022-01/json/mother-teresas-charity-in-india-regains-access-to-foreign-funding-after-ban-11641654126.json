    "body": "NEW DELHI—India’s government has restored approval for a Christian missionary group founded by the late Mother Teresa to receive foreign funding, two weeks after refusing that permission on Christmas Day.<br />India’s Ministry of Home Affairs didn’t say what prompted the reversal. It had previously said that it found unspecified “adverse inputs” when renewing the Missionaries of Charity’s application and that the group no longer met eligibility requirements under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act."
