    "body": "The Supreme Court’s decision to stay the Labor Department’s “vaccine or test” rule was a significant setback for the agency I once headed. It is also a vivid illustration of the difficulties ahead for President Biden’s aggressive regulatory agenda.<br />At the heart of the court’s ruling was the conclusion that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which is part of the Labor Department, is “limited to regulating ‘work-related dangers,’ ” but Covid-19 “is not an occupational hazard in most” workplaces. The virus is now among the “hazards of daily life,” the court said, encountered at home, schools, sporting events and virtually everywhere else."
