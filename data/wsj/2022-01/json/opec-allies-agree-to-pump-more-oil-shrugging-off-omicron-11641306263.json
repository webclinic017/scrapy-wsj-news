    "body": "OPEC and a coalition of Russia-led group of oil producers agreed to continue pumping more crude, pushing oil prices higher as the group bet that the Omicron variant of Covid-19 wonâ€™t have the sort of devastating effect on demand as previous waves of the virus.<br />The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a group of non-OPEC producing countries led by Russia said Tuesday they would raise their collective production by another 400,000 barrels a day in February. The group agreed last year to boost output in such increments each month until production reaches pre-pandemic levels, but reviews that policy every month."
