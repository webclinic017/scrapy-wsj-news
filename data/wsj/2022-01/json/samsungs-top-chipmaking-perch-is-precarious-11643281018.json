    "body": "Samsung Electronics  has taken the global chip making crown again. Don’t expect Taiwanese and American rivals to stand still, however: Samsung will need to keep investing heavily to keep it.<br />The Korean technology giant overtook  Intel  as the world’s largest chip maker by revenue in 2021—a feat that it managed to achieve in 2017 and 2018, too. On Thursday, Samsung reported record quarterly revenue for the three months ended December, which was also boosted by strong sales of smartphones and consumer electronics. Samsung’s path to the top has been quite different from the American chip giant’s, though: Its main semiconductor revenue comes from memory chips while Intel mostly makes microprocessors."
