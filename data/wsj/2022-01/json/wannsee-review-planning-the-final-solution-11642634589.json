    "body": "Asingle meeting can distill the essence of evil. Eighty years ago, on Jan. 20, 1942, Reinhard Heydrich, the head of the SS intelligence service and security police, presided over a high-level meeting with 14 Nazi colleagues at the elegant Wannsee villa near Berlin. The agenda: to discuss “the final solution of the Jewish question in Europe.” At the gathering’s conclusion, the event’s invitation noted, breakfast would be served.<br />This jarring disconnect between atrocity and humanity is reflected in the meeting’s minutes, which contain no hint of anyone even hiccupping at the specifics of genocide. On the contrary, an eager appetite for ethnic cleansing could not have been more apparent."
