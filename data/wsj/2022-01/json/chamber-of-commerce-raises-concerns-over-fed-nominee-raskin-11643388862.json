    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, one of Washington’s largest business groups, is raising concerns about Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Biden’s nominee to become the government’s top banking supervisor, after her calls for regulators to speed up the transition from fossil fuels.<br />The business lobbying group called on members of the Senate Banking Committee to question Ms. Raskin about her prior statements, which include calls to use financial regulation to address threats posed by climate change. Those positions have been cheered by progressive Democrats but criticized by Republicans."
