    "body": "For millions of American parents, including big-city liberals, the Covid-19 pandemic was a faith-shattering experience in public education. But there’s a forgotten liberal solution: vouchers.<br />Our colleague Stephen Sugarman, who died Dec. 26, was a committed liberal. In a 1970 book, “Private Wealth and Public Education,” he, John Coons and William Clune introduced a vision for educational vouchers that would extend the Supreme Court’s guarantee of an abstract right to attend a K-12 school of one’s choosing, public or private, into the concrete capacity to do so."
