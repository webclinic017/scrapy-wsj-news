    "body": "Microsoft Corp.  could have its work cut out getting  Activision Blizzard Inc.’s  sustainability programs up to its own standards if its planned $75 billion acquisition of the videogame maker goes ahead.<br />Microsoft has developed environmental, social and governance policies over many years, including numerous environmental and workplace-diversity disclosures, and plans to compensate for all its historical greenhouse-gas emissions. Activision lags far behind, disclosing much less ESG information and having far fewer policies in place. If the deal goes through, it could take years for Microsoft to bring Activision into line with its practices, experts said."
