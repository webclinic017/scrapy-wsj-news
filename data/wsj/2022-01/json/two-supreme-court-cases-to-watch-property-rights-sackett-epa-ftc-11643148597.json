    "body": "The new Supreme Court is getting interesting, and we donâ€™t mean only on abortion, guns and race. The Justices are also addressing crucial, but often ignored, issues on the separation of powers and property rights as they agreed to hear in two cases Monday.<br />Long-suffering Michael and Chantell Sackett will get their second run at the Environmental Protection Agency, which fought their desire to build a home on their small Idaho property for nearly 15 years. After they began construction, EPA bureaucrats deemed their property a wetland under the Clean Water Act, though there was no water on it."
