    "body": "China is once again in the throes of a determined government attempt to rein in housing prices, boost domestic consumption and reduce dependence on the outside world. Why is this all so hard?<br />There are many answers, but some researchers are increasingly focusing on one intriguing piece of the puzzle: China has far too many young men relative to women, and that distorts its economy in subtle and powerful ways. The combination of China’s now-abandoned one-child policy, originally implemented in the 1980s, and a traditional preference for male children has pushed China’s sex ratio continually higher. In the late ’90s there were roughly equal numbers of men and women in their 20s, but by 2020 there were about 111 men for every 100 women, according to official data."
