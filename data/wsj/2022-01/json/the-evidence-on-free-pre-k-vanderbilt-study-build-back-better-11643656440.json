    "body": "Democrats are looking to resurrect pieces of their Build Back Better plan, and a leading candidate is President Biden’s $200 billion universal pre-K entitlement. So it’s worth digesting new evidence that low-income children who attended a state pre-K program fared worse in sixth grade than similar children who didn’t.<br />Researchers at Vanderbilt University have been running a long-term study on Tennessee’s state pre-K program, following 2,990 low-income children. The program was oversubscribed, so researchers followed applicants who ended up in a program versus those who were turned away. This means all the children had parents motivated to sign them up for pre-K, which makes for a statistically appropriate control group."
