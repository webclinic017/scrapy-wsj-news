    "body": "Energy is Russia’s most potent nonnuclear weapon, so it’s no surprise that Vladimir Putin is leveraging it as he threatens Ukraine. Europe’s climate obsessions have made it vulnerable to Russia, and so the Biden Administration is riding to the rescue by begging the Arabs and other energy producers to boost natural gas deliveries.<br />Russia typically supplies about 40% of Europe’s gas imports, but it has sharply truncated deliveries. Kremlin officials are threatening to cut off supply if the U.S. and Europe impose sanctions in response. Germany is especially dependent on Russian gas, which is why it has been reluctant to help arm Ukraine."
