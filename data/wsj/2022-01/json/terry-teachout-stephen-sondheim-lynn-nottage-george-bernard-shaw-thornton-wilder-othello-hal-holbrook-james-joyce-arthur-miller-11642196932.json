    "body": "Stephen Sondheim’s classic arrives on Broadway in a gender-swapped production<br />Two weeks after Stephen Sondheim’s death, a revival of his first great musical has arrived on Broadway. And while revivals of “Company” long ago became common—I’ve reviewed five—this one, directed by Marianne Elliott, is by definition exceptional, for it is a high-concept production originally mounted on London’s West End in which Bobby, the seemingly confirmed bachelor whom all his friends long to see married, becomes Bobbie, a sexy bachelorette in a red pantsuit, played by none other than Katrina Lenk, who shot to stage stardom as a result of her performance in “The Band’s Visit.”"
