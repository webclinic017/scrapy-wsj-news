    "body": "In 2021 the United States Postal Service booked a $4.9 billion net loss. The USPS also reports that it has more than $120 billion in unfunded liabilities in pensions, retiree health benefits and other debts. To conserve cash, the agency has quit making payments on some of these obligations, and its perennial deficits likely portend a default.<br />The sources of the agency’s long-standing fiscal challenges are straightforward: weak revenues, high costs. The USPS’s revenues last year were only $2 billion more than in 2008. Mail volume has slid 40% over the past 15 years. Were it not for e-commerce flooding the agency with parcels, the Post Office might have gone bankrupt already."
