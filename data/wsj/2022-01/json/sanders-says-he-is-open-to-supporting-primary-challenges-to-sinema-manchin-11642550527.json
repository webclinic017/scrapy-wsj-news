    "body": "WASHINGTON—Sen. Bernie Sanders said he would be open to supporting primary challenges to Sens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia over the two Democrats’ refusal to support a pair of party priorities, a rare move for a sitting senator.<br />Ms. Sinema and Mr. Manchin have stood in the way of Democrats’ push to change Senate rules to enable the party to pass its election-law overhaul in the 50-50 Senate, drawing criticism from activists and some lawmakers. A vote on the election bill and potentially changing the filibuster are set for this week, but both are expected to fail."
