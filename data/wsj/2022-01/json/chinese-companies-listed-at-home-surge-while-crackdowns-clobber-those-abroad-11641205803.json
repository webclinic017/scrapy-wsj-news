    "body": "Stock markets in mainland China swelled to a roughly $12.7 trillion valuation in 2021, showing how domestic shares have largely been immune from the regulatory assault that has rocked many Chinese companies listed abroad.<br />The increase in market capitalization came partly from modest price gains—as of Dec. 31, the broad Shanghai Composite Index, for example, was up 4.8% from a year earlier—and partly from a rush of new listings in either Shanghai or Shenzhen. The growth cements China’s position as the world’s second-largest equity market."
