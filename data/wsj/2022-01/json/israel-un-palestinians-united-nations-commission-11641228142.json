    "body": "Your editorial “The U.N.’s Libel Machine Expands” (Dec. 28) correctly calls out the outrageous creation of yet another one-sided, permanent, standing United Nations commission, set up solely to investigate and castigate Israel. The U.N. already has three incongruous bodies (the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, the Division for Palestinian Rights and the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Human Rights Practices) whose sole purpose is to vilify Israel. With all the crises, conflicts and catastrophes facing the world, no other U.N. member state merits the “honor” of such unique treatment.<br />Despite the new commission’s theatrical public “call for submissions,” there is no hope of transparency or due process. The verdict is already in: Israel is guilty as charged, of every manner of war crime and abuse."
