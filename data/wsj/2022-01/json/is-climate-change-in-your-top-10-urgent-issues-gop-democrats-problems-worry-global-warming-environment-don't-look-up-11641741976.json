    "body": "At a recent dinner, I sat between two men talking past each other. “Mr. Redd” was complaining about our borders and how President Biden’s policies have led to the arrest of nearly two million illegal immigrants. “Mr. Bleu” jumped in, “First of all, they’re unauthorized migrants. Second, I can’t believe you’re worried about that. It’s not even on my top 10 list.” Not one to let a good brawl whimper out unnecessarily, I asked sheepishly, “What’s No. 1?” “Climate change,” he replied. I couldn’t resist. “Really, over failed schools? The homeless? Opioids? Structural unemployment? China?” I asked. “Yup, follow the science,” he said. Ugh. He probably thought the dim-witted eco-allegory “Don’t Look Up” on  Netflix  was a documentary.<br />Sure enough, if you check the latest Quinnipiac poll of “the most urgent issues facing the country today,” you get the same divide. For Republicans, the answer is immigration (28%), the economy (24%) and the federal debt (10%). For Democrats, it’s Covid-19 (28%), healthcare (14%) and climate change (13%)."
