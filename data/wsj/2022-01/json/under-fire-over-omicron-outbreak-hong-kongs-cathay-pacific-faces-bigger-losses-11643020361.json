    "body": "HONG KONG—An Omicron outbreak triggered by returning aircrew breaking quarantine rules has pitted Hong Kong officials against the city’s flagship carrier,  Cathay Pacific ,  prompting tighter quarantine rules that the airline says will worsen its pandemic losses.<br />Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has said Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. will be held accountable for any fault found in the outbreaks, which pierced the city’s zero-Covid bubble late last year. Her government is examining whether the airline broke Covid-19 rules by allowing passenger flight crew to return on cargo planes to get quarantine exemptions."
