    "body": "WASHINGTON—A majority of Supreme Court justices expressed skepticism Friday of the Biden administration’s Covid-19 vaccine-or-testing plan for large employers but somewhat less concern about a vaccination mandate for healthcare workers, in a special session that examined the scope of the federal government’s powers during a fast-moving pandemic.<br />Over nearly four hours of oral arguments, in which most justices for the first time wore masks on the bench, Justice Department lawyers argued the Biden administration had clear authority to impose vaccine requirements, especially with Covid-19 cases increasing to new records. Lawyers for business groups and Republican-led states were equally adamant that the administration, even if well-intentioned, was crossing legal boundaries with serious consequences for workers and the economy."
