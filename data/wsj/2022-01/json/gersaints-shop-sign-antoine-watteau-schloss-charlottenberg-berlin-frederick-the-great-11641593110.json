    "body": "With just months left to live, a consumptive Antoine Watteau (1684-1721), the celebrated Rococo master, made his final painting in a curiously prosaic format: a sign to hang outside a Parisian art gallery.<br />The painting was a gift for shopkeeper Edmé-François Gersaint, and Watteau himself proposed the idea. “I had some reluctance to grant his wish,” Gersaint recalled, “much preferring to occupy him with something more substantial; but seeing it would please him, I agreed.” Gersaint’s concerns were ultimately misplaced. Watteau’s largest artwork at 10 feet across, “Gersaint’s Shopsign” is an understated masterwork. Housed in the Schloss Charlottenburg in Berlin, it retains its poignancy as a last adieu to the Parisian art world where Watteau made his way."
