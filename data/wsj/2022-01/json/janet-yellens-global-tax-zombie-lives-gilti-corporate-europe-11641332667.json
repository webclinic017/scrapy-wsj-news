    "body": "The Biden Administration’s Build Back Better spending extravaganza may be on life support, but some of its tax-raising gimmicks may survive. We warned in October that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is enlisting foreign partners to bully Congress into passing some tax provisions in the reconciliation bill, and that strategy is outliving the bill.<br />Some of the worst tax ideas in Build Back Better concerned taxation of U.S. companies’ global profits. The 2017 tax reform created a new tax—the Global Intangible Low-Tax Income tax, or Gilti—that acts as a global minimum tax on U.S. firms."
