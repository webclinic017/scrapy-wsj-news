    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) laid out a legislative maneuver that allows the Senate to begin debate on Democrats’ elections legislation this week, even as a path to final passage remains elusive.<br />His plan, outlined in a memo to colleagues, doesn’t sidestep the main hurdles to passage of the bills, which would still remain subject to the 60-vote filibuster threshold for most legislation in the 50-50 Senate. But it does advance the bills to floor debate, a preliminary step that had been repeatedly blocked last year because of strong Republican opposition."
