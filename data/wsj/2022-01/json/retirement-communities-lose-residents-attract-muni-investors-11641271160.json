    "body": "Investors are snapping up municipal debt sold by senior-living facilities despite record default rates, pandemic-related revenue losses and costly labor shortages.<br />Covid-19’s rapid spread through eldercare facilities, along with the pandemic’s lockdowns, deterred many older Americans from moving into senior communities. Nearly 8% of the $41 billion in outstanding senior-living bonds are in default as of December, according to Municipal Market Analytics, the most since tracking began in 2009. The sector now accounts for almost one-quarter of defaulted debt in the muni market, not including bonds caught up in Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy."
