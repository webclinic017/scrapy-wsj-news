    "body": "On Dec. 13, 1740, the Prussian king Frederick II slipped out of a masquerade ball and mounted his horse at the head of 27,000 well-drilled troops. Three days later, he crossed the frontier into neighboring Silesia, northernmost province of the Habsburg Monarchy, then at peace with Prussia.<br />Frederick had chosen his moment wisely. In late October, the emperor Charles VI had died without a male heir, leaving the chaotic jumble of territories that made up the Habsburg patrimony to his 23-year-old daughter, Maria Theresa. The realm that she inherited was in a pitiable state: its army demoralized following a recent defeat by the Turks; its treasury depleted by Charles’s long campaign of bribery to secure the sanction of Europe’s other monarchs for his daughter’s inheritance."
