    "body": "One hundred and fifty political scientists signed an open letter to Congress six weeks ago declaring that “midnight is approaching” for American democracy. Among their concerns was Republican gerrymandering. They wrote that “drawing fair district boundaries . . . should not be partisan”—but the GOP has shown “a clear intent to entrench minority rule.”<br />It has been an article of faith among those who claim to be most knowledgeable about American politics that this year’s House of Representatives redistricting would give Republicans an edge in November and even keep the GOP in power indefinitely despite public opposition."
