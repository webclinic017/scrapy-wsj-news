    "body": "India’s antitrust watchdog ordered an investigation into how  Apple Inc.  runs its App Store, becoming the most recent country to take aim at the U.S. technology giant.<br />The order from the Competition Commission of India said Friday that its initial view is that the Cupertino, Calif., company has violated some of the country’s antitrust laws. The body is “prima facie convinced that a case is made out for directing an investigation” into Apple, the order said."
