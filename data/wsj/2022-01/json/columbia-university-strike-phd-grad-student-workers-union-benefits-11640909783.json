    "body": "Columbia University is clearly perturbed by your editorial “United Auto Workers of the Ivy League” (Dec. 18), calling attention to the hypocrisy of a liberal institution underpaying its core workers. Although Provost Mary Boyce has remained absent from every bargaining session with Student Workers of Columbia, she makes time to defend the administration’s treatment of Ph.D. workers like myself in your paper (Letters, Dec. 27).<br />Columbia’s most recent compensation package is not “one of the most generous available at any U.S. university,” as Ms. Boyce writes. It pales in comparison to the package at its key local competitor, NYU. Although it appears more generous than Harvard’s, it is inferior when the cost of living in Manhattan is considered."
