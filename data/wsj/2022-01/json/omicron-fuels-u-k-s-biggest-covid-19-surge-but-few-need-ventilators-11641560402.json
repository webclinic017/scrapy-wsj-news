    "body": "LONDON—The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has fueled the biggest surge in Covid-19 cases in the U.K. since the pandemic began, but the number of people critically ill in hospitals hasn’t increased significantly, a promising sign for countries including the U.S. that are seeing their own rapid run-ups in infections.<br />Doctors say Omicron is making fewer people seriously sick and the severe respiratory problems that were hallmarks of earlier waves of Covid-19 aren’t so prevalent this time around. The change reflects differences in how the variant attacks the body, booster shots shielding the most vulnerable against the severest aspects of the disease, and better treatments that forestall Covid-19’s progression."
