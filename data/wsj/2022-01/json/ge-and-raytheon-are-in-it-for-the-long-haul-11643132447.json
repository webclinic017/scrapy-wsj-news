    "body": "Jet-engine makers are getting back to business, but they still need more long-haul flying.<br />Two of the largest U.S. aerospace suppliers had a rough day Tuesday after reporting fourth-quarter earnings that investors found disappointing. Shares in  General Electric  fell roughly 7% shortly after the market opened, while those in  Raytheon Technologies —the parent of engine maker Pratt & Whitney and aerospace-parts supplier Collins Aerospace—lost about 1%.  GE  emphasized how supply-chain bottlenecks are hurting sales ahead of its planned split into three units, one of which will be a stand-alone aviation company."
