    "body": "Credit Suisse  Group AG issued a profit warning on Tuesday, the latest setback for the beleaguered Swiss bank.<br />The bank said its profits for the fourth quarter of last year would be hit by setting aside provisions for legal costs of around 500 million Swiss francs, equivalent to $545 million, mostly related to legacy matters in its investment bank. The charge will be partially offset by real estate sales worth 225 million Swiss francs."
