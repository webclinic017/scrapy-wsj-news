    "body": "WASHINGTON—The good news for Rep. Haley Stevens is that her 11th Congressional District was redrawn to become a lot more blue. The bad news is she will have to run against friend and fellow Michigan Democrat Rep. Andy Levin to stay in Congress.<br />Both say they have the best claim to the new district, after the state’s map was redrawn during a once-in-a-decade redistricting process. The district lost some of Ms. Stevens’s more-conservative constituents and picked up some more-liberal voters from the old districts of Mr. Levin and another adjacent lawmaker."
