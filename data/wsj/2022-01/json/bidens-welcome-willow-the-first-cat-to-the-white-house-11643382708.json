    "body": "President Biden and first lady Jill Biden have brought a Tabby cat, named Willow, from a Pennsylvania farm to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave, Dr. Biden shared on Twitter.<br />“Willow made quite an impression on Dr. Biden in 2020 when she jumped up on the stage and interrupted her remarks during a campaign stop,” Dr. Biden’s spokesman, Michael LaRosa, said. “Seeing their immediate bond, the owner of the farm knew that Willow belonged with Dr. Biden.”"
