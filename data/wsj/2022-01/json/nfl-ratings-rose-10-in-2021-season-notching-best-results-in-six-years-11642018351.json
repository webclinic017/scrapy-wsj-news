    "body": "Television and digital ratings for the National Football League’s regular-season games jumped 10% compared with last season and were the league’s best numbers since 2015, according to Nielsen data.<br />The average audience for regular-season games was 17.1 million viewers, compared with 15.6 million in the 2020 regular season. Last season was marred by the Covid-19 pandemic, leading to empty stadiums and many rescheduled games as players contracted the coronavirus. In addition, coverage of the 2020 presidential election led to strong ratings competition from cable-news networks."
