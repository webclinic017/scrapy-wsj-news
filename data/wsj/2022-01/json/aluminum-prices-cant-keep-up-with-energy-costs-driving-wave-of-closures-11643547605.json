    "body": "Tensions between the U.S. and Russia over Ukraine are exacerbating a shakeout in the aluminum sector, which has been hammered by rising power prices over the past year.<br />The price of aluminum has increased by 24% over the past six months to more than $3,100 a metric ton, approaching a decade high.
