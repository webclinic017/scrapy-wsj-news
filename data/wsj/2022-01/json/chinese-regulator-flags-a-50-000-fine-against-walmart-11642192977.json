    "body": "A local Chinese regulator and state media highlighted this week a roughly $50,000 fine  Walmart Inc.  paid last year, keeping a spotlight on the U.S. retailer at a time of rising political tensions between Beijing and Washington.<br />In recent weeks, Chinese authorities and media have criticized Walmart or touted past infractions. In late December, Walmart was warned by China’s anticorruption watchdog after local reports that it wasn’t selling products from Xinjiang. A few days later, a media outlet backed by China’s market regulator highlighted an administrative action from 2021 for cybersecurity infractions that didn’t result in a fine."
