    "body": "Life has given airlines lemons: Where there were corporate travelers flying business class, now they have Covid-conscious tourists paying for premium seats. But this lemonade may be a less profitable thing to sell.<br />Leisure fliers are upgrading to roomier seats with better food. This “premium economy” class has long been seen by U.S. airlines as a source of growth, and amid the pandemic it is finally living up to hopes. American Airlines said in its latest earnings report that premium sales in the domestic market were higher than in 2019, even though revenues from business passengers were down 36%."
