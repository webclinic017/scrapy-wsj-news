    "body": "Vladimir Putin has spent two decades trying to reassert Russian dominion, one way or another, over former Soviet republics. His deployment this week of foreign troops to quell unrest in Kazakhstan represents a short-term victory for his revanchist foreign policy, but it also exposes the fragility of his ambition.<br />Protests began over the weekend in western Kazakhstan after the government lifted caps on fuel prices. Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev fired his cabinet and reinstituted price controls, but it wasn’t enough for a population fed up with much more than expensive liquefied petroleum gas. Protests spread around the country, and there are widespread reports of fires and shootouts as protesters stormed government buildings."
