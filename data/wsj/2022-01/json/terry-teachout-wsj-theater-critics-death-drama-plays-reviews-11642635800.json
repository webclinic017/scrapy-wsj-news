    "body": "Terry Teachout wrote as someone who truly loved the theater and the artists who create it (“Terry Teachout,” Review & Outlook, Jan. 14). He was honest but never unnecessarily harsh, always gave credit where it was due, and opened my eyes to the wealth of beautiful theater being created across the nation. Reading a Teachout review was like seeing the show with him—and he often made the show sound so marvelous, I wished I could have. As a fellow lover of the theater, I will deeply miss his contributions to these pages.<br />Rachel Hurt"
