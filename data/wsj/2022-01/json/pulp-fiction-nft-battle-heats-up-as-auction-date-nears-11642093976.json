    "body": "A dispute between Quentin Tarantino and Miramax over the writer-director’s efforts to auction off script pages and other artifacts from the hit movie “Pulp Fiction” as nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, has gone from legal squabble to public brawl.<br />At issue is who controls the rights to the material Mr. Tarantino is seeking to auction. Miramax, the producers of the 1994 film, filed a suit in November in U.S. District Court in California against Mr. Tarantino alleging copyright infringement and breach of contract. Mr. Tarantino’s camp claims he does have the rights for the NFTs."
