Andrew Cuomo on Friday after prosecutors said they were unable to move forward with the case.<br />The Democratic former governor was charged in October with forcible touching in connection with a 2020 incident in which his then-executive assistant, Brittany Commisso, said he groped her breast at the Executive Mansion. Mr. Cuomo has denied Ms. Commisso’s account."
