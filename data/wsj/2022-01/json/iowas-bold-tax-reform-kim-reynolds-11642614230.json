    "body": "The economic recovery has state governments rolling in tax revenue, and most are spending the windfall, on pace to spend an average of 9.3% more than in 2021. Iowa’s Kim Reynolds is among a handful of governors returning money to taxpayers to sustain the economic rebound.<br />Gov. Reynolds is proposing a bold tax reform that would increase the incentives to work and invest in the Hawkeye State. Her proposal unveiled last week would reshape the state income tax, gradually consolidating brackets en route to a flat 4% rate by 2026. “When the bill’s fully implemented,” she said, “an average Iowa family will pay more than $1,300 less in taxes.”"
