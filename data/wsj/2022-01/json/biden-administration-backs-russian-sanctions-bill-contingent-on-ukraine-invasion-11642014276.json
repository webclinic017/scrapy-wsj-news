    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The Biden administration has thrown its support behind a bill that would impose mandatory sanctions against Russian leaders, banks and businesses if Moscow escalates hostilities or further invades Ukraine.<br />The endorsement comes as the White House lobbies wavering Democratic senators against another sanctions bill expected to get a Senate vote this week that is sponsored by Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas). The Cruz bill would initiate sanctions against Nord Stream 2, a pipeline built to deliver Russian natural gas to Germany."
