    "body": "The American labor market these days is one of the strangest in memory. Job growth in December was disappointing for the second month in a row, but the jobless rate fell to 3.9% and everyone who wants a job can get one—or two if you’re up for it.<br />The overall report was better than the topline job growth of 199,000 for the month. Revisions added 141,000 jobs in October and November, while the labor force grew by 168,000. The labor participation rate was flat but the employment rate fell all the way to 3.2% for white Americans. The oddity in the report is that the jobless rate popped up for black Americans to 7.1%, after falling to 6.5% in November, but this data tends to be volatile in any single month."
