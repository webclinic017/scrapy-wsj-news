    "body": "“Germany’s Energy Surrender” (Review and Outlook, Dec. 23) makes one wonder what the German leaders and people fear more: Russia’s use of natural gas to control the European economy through blackmail, the generation of carbon-dioxide emissions from coal, or the one-half ounce (14.175 grams) of spent fuel generated from a nuclear reactor per capita over a person’s lifetime?<br />With a conscious effort, society can safely manage and mitigate the last two consequences. The Russian government has said it would never use its natural-gas supply for geopolitical exploitation. When was the last time the Russian government could be trusted?"
