    "body": "ALBANY, N.Y.—Albany County prosecutors said Tuesday that they wouldn’t move forward with a misdemeanor sex crime charge against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, removing the most immediate legal threat to the embattled Democrat.<br />Mr. Cuomo was charged last October with forcibly touching his assistant Brittany Commisso during a 2020 encounter at the Executive Mansion in Albany. Ms. Commisso spoke to investigators working for Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple, whose office filed the charge against Mr. Cuomo without coordinating with the district attorney, P. David Soares, officials said."
