    "body": "THE BEAUTY OF travel has always been its unpredictability but, in the Covid era, unpredictable has taken on new meaning. In November 2021, finding myself able to travel again and desperate to escape the sensory deprivation tank that has been Covid living, I chose my first destination: the small town of Delphi, perched on the side of Mount Parnassus in central Greece. I went to that shrine of knowledge and prediction because, if the past two years have shown us anything, it’s that we really have no idea what the future holds. I needed to see something, anything, that I hadn’t seen before. I also wanted to understand how the ancients had dealt with their crises of doubt and anxiety and the basic human inability to see what’s coming.<br />Delphi is where the uncertain have always gone to ease their uncertainty, a place of pilgrimage since before recorded history. One of the first travel writers, Pausanias, described it extensively in his tourist guide to the ancient world, around 1,800 years ago. Scholars consider the roughly 100-mile-long walk from Athens to Delphi’s Temple of Apollo among the oldest continuously used footpaths in the world. It’s one of the first trips people took with the goal of trying to figure things out."
