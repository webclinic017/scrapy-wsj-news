    "body": "In recent years, Western foreign policy experts have focused on planning for a long-term cold war with China. As 2022 dawns, however, a more pressing crisis has come to the fore: the unexpected prospect of a hot war in Europe.<br />To all appearances, Russian troops are preparing to launch a major invasion of Ukraine. The conflict there since 2014 has already resulted in at least 10,000 deaths and 24,000 casualties. A full-scale Russian attack would meet fierce Ukrainian resistance and lead to significant bloodshed. Military advisers from the U.S. and other NATO states are currently stationed in Ukraine, and should they suffer casualties, the conflict could widen, with potentially devastating consequences."
