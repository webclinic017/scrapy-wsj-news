    "body": "Reviewers are often asked to avoid spoilers, aka plot points, plot twists and anything that might remotely disturb the experience of whatever masterwork is under consideration. Sometimes, the admonishments are at the level of “Don’t tell ’em the boat sinks” in “Titanic.” But with “Wolf Like Me,” the impulse is to forge ahead and not reveal anything. The six-episode series is so charming, disarming and odd it’s almost a work of magic. And, as with any magic trick, the delight depends on not knowing how it’s going to work.<br />At the same time, what will viewers possibly think they’re in for with a show titled “Wolf Like Me”? It’s hard to imagine (especially with the echo of “Black Like Me”), but the sleight of hand begins with a literal bang: one car T-boning the other at an intersection in Adelaide, Australia, onlookers gasping amid a shower of glass and a shriek of metal. The drivers—Gary (Josh Gad) and Mary (Isla Fisher)—are miraculously unhurt, as is Gary’s 11-year-old passenger, his daughter, Emma (the wonderful Ariel Donoghue), whom we have already learned is prone to panic attacks and depression after the death of her mother. Flipping through the air several times after a potentially lethal collision hardly seems like the treatment she needs."
