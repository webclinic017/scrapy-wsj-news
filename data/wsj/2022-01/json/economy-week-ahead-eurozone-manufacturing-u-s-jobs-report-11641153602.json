Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimate the unemployment rate fell as employers added jobs at a faster pace.<br />IHS Markit  will provide a look at the health of the European manufacturing sector with December’s purchasing managers index. The index is expected to slip slightly to 58.0 from 58.4 in November, amid a continuing supply-chain crunch and rising Covid-19 infection rates in Europe."
