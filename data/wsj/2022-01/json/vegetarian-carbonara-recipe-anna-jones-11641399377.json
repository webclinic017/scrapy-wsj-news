    "body": "IT’S BEEN NEARLY eight years since the British food stylist and writer Anna Jones published her first cookbook, “A Modern Way to Eat.” Back then, vegetarianism “definitely had some negative and ungenerous connotations,” said Ms. Jones recently. “I was very careful. I really wanted people to get excited about the food and then, 40 pages in, realize that there wasn’t any meat or fish.”<br />Her fourth book, “One: Pot, Pan, Planet” (Knopf), published in the U.S. Jan. 4, marks a “change of step,” to borrow her phrase. In addition to offering a new collection of plant-based recipes—all of which can be made using only a pot or two—it serves as a guide to environmentally sustainable eating, shopping and cooking. “I’ve realized that the kitchen is one area where people can feel some agency and make small, not incredibly expensive daily decisions that are repeatable, that are actually joyful, that are delicious.” Here, she shares insight into how she cooks for herself, her husband and their 6-year-old son at home in London’s Hackney neighborhood."
