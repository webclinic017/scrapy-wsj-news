    "body": "For the second time in five years,  Unilever ’s  board of directors has an unwelcome American on its hands.<br />Unilever shares rose 5% Monday morning as investors digested news that activist investor Nelson Peltzhas built a stake. The London-based consumer-goods company that sells Dove soap and Dollar Shave Club razors last week called off an unpopular $68 billion bid for  GlaxoSmithKline ’s  consumer-healthcare business. Mr. Peltz’s Trian Partners fund began buying shares in the British business before news of the Glaxo approach broke, but the misstep gives him extra leverage to push for change."
