    "body": "Witnesses started poking some holes in the governmentâ€™s case against Gang Chen, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor accused of hiding his ties to China, soon after his arrest in January 2021, interviews and a review of related documents show, a year before prosecutors decided last week to drop criminal charges against him.<br />In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Chen said he believed law-enforcement officials had miscalculated in bringing his case and some similar ones, in part because they are unfamiliar with how scientists work."
