    "body": "The United Arab Emirates is set to introduce a tax on corporate profits, as it juggles the need to remain attractive for international business with its agreement to support global tax transparency.<br />The Gulf state, which includes Dubai and Abu Dhabi, has grown from a desert backwater into the region’s second-biggest economy, in part based on its status as a global tax-haven for both individuals and companies. A new 9% tax rate will apply from June 1, 2023, and will help the U.A.E. meet, “international standards for tax transparency,” the country’s finance ministry said."
