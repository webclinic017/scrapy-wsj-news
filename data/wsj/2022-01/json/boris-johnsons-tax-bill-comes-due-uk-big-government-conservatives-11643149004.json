    "body": "As U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s political future becomes less certain, now might seem like an odd time for British Conservatives to argue about tax policy. But they’re right to do so. Mr. Johnson’s career is in danger in large part because he has attempted a foolish and failing agenda of big government conservatism.<br />Police said Tuesday they’re investigating parties that were allegedly held in Mr. Johnson’s office-and-residence complex in London’s Downing Street in contravention of lockdown rules in 2020. If evidence emerges that he misled lawmakers about these parties, he may be forced to resign, or subjected to a no-confidence vote by lawmakers from his Conservative party."
