    "body": "While Americans were last-minute gift shopping on Christmas Eve, Luis Aguilar Rivera was uploading a lamentation from Havana on YouTube.<br />The day before, the Cuban military dictatorship had handed Mr. Aguilar Rivera’s 21-year-old son—who reportedly has cognitive issues—a 22-year prison sentence for his participation in the antigovernment protests of July 11-13. “It seems incredible that in this country, where it is said that the people come first, this is happening. It cannot be,” Mr. Aguilar Rivera insisted on the video."
