    "body": "Jeffrey Scott Shapiro is correct that insurrection under 18 U.S.C. 2383 is a crime with specific elements (“Stop Calling Jan. 6 an ‘Insurrection,’” op-ed, Jan. 6). But he misstates the law and the facts.<br />The terms “rebellion” and “insurrection” in the statute are undefined and the case law applying this section is sparse. If the exercise of statutory interpretation should involve dictionary definitions such as those that Mr. Shapiro cites—an “act or instance of revolting against civil authority,” “an armed uprising that quickly fails or succeeds”—it would seem that the case against those who breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, bearing knives, clubs, shields and guns, would be ironclad."
