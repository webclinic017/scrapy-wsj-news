    "body": "Americans should not have to leave their hometowns in order to seek opportunity or build wealth. But our modern, digital economy has concentrated its dynamism in a handful of mostly coastal cities, including San Francisco, Seattle, New York, Boston and Austin. When these cities prosper, cities such as Youngstown, Ohio, or Beckley, West Virginia, don’t share in the benefit. Many residents of middle-American cities and rural areas are tired of seeing their young people buy one-way tickets out of their home states in search of work. They worry about the loss of community, the shuttering of stores and the dwindling of church congregations.<br />Most of these Americans understand the importance of the tech sector to the U.S. economy. Technology creates trillion-dollar valuations, billionaire entrepreneurs and six-figure salaries for those still in their twenties. By 2025, the U.S. will have 25 million digital jobs—more than the number of manufacturing and construction jobs combined. These jobs have a median salary of $80,000, nearly double the national average. They should not be available only to high-schoolers in Cupertino, Calif.—home to Apple—who have sophisticated robotics workshops in their garages."
