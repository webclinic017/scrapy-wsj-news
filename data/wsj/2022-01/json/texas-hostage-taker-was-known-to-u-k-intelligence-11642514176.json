    "body": "LONDON—The British man who took four people hostage at a synagogue in Texas had previously been investigated by the U.K.’s domestic intelligence service, according to a British security official familiar with the matter.<br />Malik Faisal Akram, from northern England, was the subject of a preliminary investigation in late 2020, the official said. However MI5, the U.K.’s domestic intelligence agency, determined that he didn’t present an immediate risk to national security. This left Mr. Akram free to fly to the U.S. in recent days. The 44-year-old died on Saturday after a standoff with U.S. enforcement officials in the Dallas suburb of Colleyville."
