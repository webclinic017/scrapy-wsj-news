    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is exploring regulatory changes or other measures that would let seniors on Medicare get free, over-the-counter Covid-19 tests or expanded access to the tests.<br />The White House recently debuted a new website where people can request a limited number of free tests be mailed to them, with officials seeking to distribute 500 million free at-home tests starting this month. The administration also this month began requiring private insurers to cover the cost of any additional over-the-counter tests."
