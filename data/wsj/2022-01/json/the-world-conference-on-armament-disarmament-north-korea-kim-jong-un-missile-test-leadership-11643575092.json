    "body": "Irony died at the United Nations a long time ago, but now North Korea is dancing on its grave. See the recent news that Pyongyang—which conducted its seventh missile test of the year on Sunday—will soon chair the U.N. Conference on Disarmament.<br />The 65-member forum, whose presidency rotates based on alphabetical order, exists to support nuclear disarmament and oppose the creation of new weapons of mass destruction. China currently has the job as it conducts its own secretive nuclear buildup. North Korea will take the role in May after Cuba’s rotation is over. Iran is also a member, if anyone is wondering."
