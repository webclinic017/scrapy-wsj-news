    "body": "I experienced none of the ambivalence that reviewers did with the hit  Netflix  comedy and cultural phenomenon “Don’t Look Up,” about a comet coming to destroy the Earth and the failure of the media, the public and politicians to deal with it.<br />The characterizations, the gags, the one-liners were a hoot.
