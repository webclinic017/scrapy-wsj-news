    "body": "President Biden hasn’t yet chosen his nominee to replace Stephen Breyer on the Supreme Court, but already any criticism is being ruled off-limits by the progressive auditors of political debate. Witness the assault on Ilya Shapiro, a legal commentator, for daring to challenge Mr. Biden’s pledge to choose his nominee first and foremost on the basis of gender and race.<br />Mr. Biden pledged during the 2020 South Carolina primary campaign to select a black woman for the Court, as a way to win the support of influential Rep. James Clyburn. The gambit worked. Mr. Clyburn endorsed, Mr. Biden won in the Palmetto State, and he went on to defeat Donald Trump."
