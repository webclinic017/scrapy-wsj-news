    "body": "Not every artist is fortunate enough to go out on a high, but Ludwig Mies van der Rohe did. His Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin offers as thrilling a vision of his aspirations of structural expressiveness as can be found.<br />Set on a granite podium astride a somewhat-sloping site, the building consists of a square, single-story, glass-walled pavilion topped by a flat, coffered roof that projects well beyond its interior volume, supported only by two columns on each side. The museum reopened in August after a five-year renovation by David Chipperfield Architects, which sought to refresh the facility without obscuring its Miesian essence, a task at which the firm succeeded wildly. Thousands of granite slabs were replaced, numerous elements replicated from scratch, and all of the single-paned glass panels swapped out for dual-paned panels, which required marginal shearing of mullions (which you will not notice). The marvel of the original design is its delivery of classical colonnaded form in fully modern materials, a temple turned transparent."
