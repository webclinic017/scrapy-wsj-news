    "body": "Government retirement funds are pumping record sums into private equity, defying concerns about risk and cost as they try to plug pension shortfalls.<br />U.S. pension funds’ private-equity investments swelled to an average 8.9% of holdings in 2021 after three years of straight growth, according to analytics company Preqin. That amounts to roughly $480 billion of state and local pension fund assets tracked by the Federal Reserve, up from about $300 billion in 2018."
