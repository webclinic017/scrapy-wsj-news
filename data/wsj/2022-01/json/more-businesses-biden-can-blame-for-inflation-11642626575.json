    "body": "The White House and congressional Democrats have decided that bashing businesses for rising prices is more politically useful than admitting Washington fault for the debt-fueled federal spending, misguided incentives and epic money creation that are driving inflation.<br />Team Biden has recently blamed food companies like meat and poultry producers for rising prices. The president and his Democratic allies have also targeted energy companies."
