    "body": "‘Buy as much hay as you can,” our farm manager commanded in 1988. “The hay crop is bad. Prices are up. We need to build inventory.” We proceeded to buy an extra 3,000 tons of hay, used to make mushroom compost, at record high prices. We unloaded the bales from delivery trucks, loaded them onto flatbed trailers, hauled them into the fields, and stacked them into neat rows. We covered the rows and secured them with ropes. Then storms ripped the shrouds, rain soaked the bails, and $450,000 of hay rotted into the ground.<br />Hoarding is a natural human response during times of uncertainty, and people in business can panic-buy like shoppers jockeying for toilet paper at  Costco .  Hoarding rarely turns out well, however. With supply-chain disruptions and shortages from pandemic lockdowns, many managers are again questioning whether stocking up is really that bad. But that’s the wrong lesson to take from recent shortages."
