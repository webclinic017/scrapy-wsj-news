    "body": "Regarding Tom Rogan’s op-ed “Is Germany a Reliable American Ally? Nein” (Jan. 24): Germany listened to the green lobby and gave up reliable nuclear and coal before it had a replacement. Now Germany can’t join the Western alliance against Russia, and in defense of Ukraine, for fear of losing critical Russian gas deliveries. Ukraine may well lose its sovereignty because Germany has ceded control over its energy sector. So Russia gets a twofer: de facto control of Ukraine and Germany. There is a lesson here for President Biden and his efforts to decarbonize America prematurely.<br />Robin Traywick Williams"
