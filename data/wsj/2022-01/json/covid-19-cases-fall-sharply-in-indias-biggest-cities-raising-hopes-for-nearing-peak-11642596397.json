    "body": "NEW DELHI—Covid-19 cases in New Delhi and Mumbai have fallen sharply in recent days as a surge of the Omicron variant peaks in some of India’s biggest cities, raising hopes that prior infections will offset a relatively low vaccination rate and help prevent a repeat of last year’s catastrophic wave.<br />India is still a few weeks away from a nationwide peak, as the virus continues to spread in rural areas and smaller cities, according to doctors and public-health experts, who also warn that daily hospitalizations and deaths will likely continue climbing even as infections slow down."
