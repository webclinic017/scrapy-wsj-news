    "body": "It seems that violent attacks on Jews in the U.S. have become a regular occurrence, like natural disasters. There were deadly shootings at synagogues in Pittsburgh in October 2018 and Poway, Calif., in April 2019, then at a kosher market in Jersey City, N.J., in December 2019. Last weekend, a rabbi and three congregants were taken hostage at Congregation Beth Israel, a Reform synagogue near Fort Worth, Texas. After a standoff that lasted more than 10 hours and involved an elite FBI hostage rescue team, the Jews in the synagogue were freed unharmed and the perpetrator, identified by the FBI as Malik Faisal Akram, was killed.<br />As with wildfires or hurricanes, we can search for man-made causes and seek possible remedies. But for many Jews—as for many Californians caught in the blazes or Floridians in the storms—there is a sense of helplessness, as if our actions are no match for what has been decided, whether by God, history or a political and social theater in which we are bit players. We are tempted to conclude that we are simply never safe, not even in a country as good for Jews as the U.S. has been."
