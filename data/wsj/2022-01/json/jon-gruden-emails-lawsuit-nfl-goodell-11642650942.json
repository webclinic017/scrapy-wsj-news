    "body": "The National Football League said in a court filing Wednesday that a lawsuit by former Las Vegas Raiders coach Jon Gruden, which blames the league for leaking emails that lead to his exit as coach, is “baseless.”<br />Gruden sued the NFL in November, alleging the league and commissioner Roger Goodell had orchestrated his downfall by releasing years-old emails in which he used offensive language. Shortly after those emails were reported, first by The Wall Street Journal, Gruden resigned."
