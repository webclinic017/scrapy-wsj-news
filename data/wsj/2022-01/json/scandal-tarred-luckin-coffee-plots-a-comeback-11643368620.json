    "body": "HONG KONG—Nearly two years after  Luckin Coffee Inc.  stunned global investors with an audacious accounting fraud, the Chinese coffee chain is attempting to turn over a new leaf.<br />Luckin, a major rival to  Starbucks Corp.  in China, was forced to delist from the  Nasdaq  Stock Market in 2020 after revealing that some of its former employees fabricated more than $300 million in sales. Since then, the company has been embroiled in bankruptcy court proceedings and litigation with creditors and shareholders. It paid a $180 million penalty to settle civil charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and was also fined by the Chinese government. The firm replaced most of its top management and ousted its former chairman, chief executive and other employees who carried out the fraud."
