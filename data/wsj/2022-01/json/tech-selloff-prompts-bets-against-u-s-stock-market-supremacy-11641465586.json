    "body": "U.S. stocks beat shares elsewhere in the world by the widest margin in almost a quarter-century last year, powered by big technology companies. Some investors are betting that rising interest rates and a tech swoon could bring Americaâ€™s winning streak to an end in 2022.<br />A glimpse of how that might pan out emerged Wednesday when Federal Reserve meeting minutes pointed to a possible rate increase in March. Investors dumped tech stocks, pushing the Nasdaq Composite Index to its worst loss since February. Futures on Thursday pointed to further losses in tech shares."
