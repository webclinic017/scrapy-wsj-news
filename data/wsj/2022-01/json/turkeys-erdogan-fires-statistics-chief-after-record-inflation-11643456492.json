    "body": "ISTANBUL—Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan replaced the head of the state statistics agency weeks after it reported record inflation, which added to anger in the country over its economic woes, and appointed another member of the ruling party as justice minister.<br />The presidential orders, published early Saturday, come as Mr. Erdogan narrows the circle of advisers around him during an economic crisis in which Turkey’s currency lost some 40% of its value last year. The Turkish president has fired a series of senior officials who opposed his unorthodox approach in which he has insisted on cutting interest rates to spur economic growth despite rampant inflation."
