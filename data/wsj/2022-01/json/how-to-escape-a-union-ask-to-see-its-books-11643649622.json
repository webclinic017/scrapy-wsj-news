    "body": "A situation like Avraham Goldstein’s was heard by the Supreme Court in 1988 (“I’m Stuck With an Anti-Semitic Labor Union,” op-ed, Jan. 21). In Communications Workers of America v. Beck, the court ruled that union members can claim “financial core” status and pay only that percentage of dues that go to labor-related issues. By doing so, they gain the right to require the union to open its books for an audit, to double check the union’s calculations regarding what is and isn’t work related.<br />It will probably be cheaper for the union not to charge Mr. Goldstein dues than to risk an independent audit that could uncover questionable expenses. That was my experience when I did the same thing more than 30 years ago over a disagreement I had with my union. I haven’t paid a dime in union dues since."
