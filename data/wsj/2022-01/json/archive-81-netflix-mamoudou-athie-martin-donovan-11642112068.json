    "body": "The found-footage horror story is a relatively recent phenomenon—“The Blair Witch Project,” which seems to have kicked things off, is just 23 years old; two landmarks, “Paranormal Activity” and the Spanish masterpiece “REC,” date only to 2007. But the misinterpretation of recorded material for thriller purposes has a longer legacy: The original “Blow-Up” (1966), for instance, was about the ambiguity of a photograph; “The Conversation” (1974) was about a misunderstood murder plot.<br />“Archive 81,” the Netflix series “loosely inspired” by the podcast of the same name, is a worthy addition to the catalog, a mix of media, messages, storylines, timelines and psychologies, including the damaged one at the center of the story: Dan Turner (Mamoudou Athie), a video archivist at the real-life Museum of the Moving Image in New York, is a benignly obsessive collector of video ephemera; he buys VHS cassettes off the street not knowing their contents; he addresses badly damaged Mylar with doctorly precision."
