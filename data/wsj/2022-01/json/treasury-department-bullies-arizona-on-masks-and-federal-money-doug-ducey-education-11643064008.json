    "body": "Doesn’t the Treasury Department have better things to do than pick a fight with states over masks that it’s likely to lose? Apparently not. Arizona on Friday sued Treasury after getting slapped with this ultimatum: Drop mask conditions on two federally funded education programs, or we will claw back the money and withhold future funds from last March’s $1.9 trillion spending bill.<br />Democrats gave states broad latitude to spend their share of the $220 billion relief from the bill to address economic and fiscal damage from the pandemic. They imposed only two explicit restrictions: States could not use the money to directly or indirectly cut taxes. Nor may they deposit any pandemic money into public-worker pension funds."
