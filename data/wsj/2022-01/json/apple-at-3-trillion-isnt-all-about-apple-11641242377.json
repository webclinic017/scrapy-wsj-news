    "body": "Apple  Inc.  is worth $1 trillion more than it was nine months ago, yet the tech giant’s prospects haven’t changed that much in that time.<br />The company behind the iPhone, AirPods and “Ted Lasso” also became the first to hit a market value of $3 trillion on Monday. And while it remains an exclusive group, Apple isn’t alone in the 13-digit club:  Microsoft ,  Google parent  Alphabet  Inc.,   Amazon.com ,   Tesla  and Saudi Aramco all trade above that level, with  Facebook  parent  Meta Platforms  on the cusp of joining them."
