    "body": "Consumer spending ended last year on a down note. And with Covid-19 cases rising sharply, the risk is that it will weaken further.<br />The Commerce Department on Friday reported that retail sales fell a seasonally adjusted 1.9% in December from November, a far larger drop than the 0.1% tick lower that economists had forecast. Nearly every type of retailer registered declines: Department store sales slipped 7% from a month earlier, for example, electronics and appliance store sales fell 2.9% and nonstore retailers—a category dominated by  Amazon.com —fell 8.7%."
