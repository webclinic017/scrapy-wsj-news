    "body": "A recent cyberattack in Ukraine has heightened concerns in Kyiv that Moscow is plotting to support a land invasion with destructive hacks, although some experts remain puzzled about the Kremlin’s intentions.<br />Last week, hackers defaced the websites of more than 70 government agencies, according to Viktor Zhora, deputy chief of Ukraine’s State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection. More worryingly, the hackers also installed destructive “wiper” software designed to render computer systems inoperable in at least two government agencies, he said."
