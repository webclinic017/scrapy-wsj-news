    "body": "Inflation is coming to a longtime refuge of price-conscious consumers: restaurant value menus.<br />Burger King,  Denny’s Corp.  and  Domino’s Pizza Inc.  are among the chains that are reducing their menu of discounted items or shrinking portions to try to improve their margins, executives said. Some chain executives hope the trimming of discount menus and meal deals might bring less pushback from consumers than straight price increases."
