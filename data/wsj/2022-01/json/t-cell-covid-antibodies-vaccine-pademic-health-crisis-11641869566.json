    "body": "We are pleased to see the acknowledgment of the important contribution of T cells in protection and clearance of SARS-CoV-2 (“The T-Cell Covid Cavalry,” Review & Outlook, Dec. 31). The early focus in vaccine development and immunity surveillance has been heavily weighted toward neutralizing antibodies (the humoral response) because historically they are well understood and easy to measure.<br />The variants, however, have catapulted us into a new and more complex stage of this pandemic, which requires looking beyond this part of the immune response. To adequately gauge vaccine and booster efficacy, we must also consider the T cells, or cellular response. This is especially true in the case of breakthrough infections in vaccinated people, in which T cells appear to play an outsize role."
