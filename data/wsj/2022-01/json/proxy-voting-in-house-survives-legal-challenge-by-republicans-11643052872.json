    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court declined to take up Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy’s suit challenging proxy voting in the House of Representatives, effectively ending his legal challenge to rules instituted during the Covid-19 pandemic that allowed lawmakers to cast votes remotely.<br />The House voted in May 2020 to approve a Democratic proposal to allow proxy voting. At the time, Republicans objected and took the matter to court, arguing it was unconstitutional to vote by proxy and that lawmakers should come to work like employees in healthcare and schools. Democrats said the rule was necessary to operate safely at a time when health officials recommended minimizing in-person contact."
