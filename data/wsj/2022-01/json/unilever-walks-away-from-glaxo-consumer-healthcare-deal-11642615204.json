    "body": "Unilever  PLC said it wouldn’t increase its $68 billion offer for  GlaxoSmithKline  PLC’s consumer-healthcare business, effectively walking away from a potential deal that would have added a raft of drugstore staples to its portfolio.<br />The announcement Wednesday from the maker of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and Dove soap came after days of criticism from analysts and investors about the price and strategic fit of the proposed transaction. Unilever’s shares have fallen sharply this week since news of a possible deal was disclosed over the weekend."
