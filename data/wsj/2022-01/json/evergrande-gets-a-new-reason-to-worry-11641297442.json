Evergrande hasn’t disclosed why the Danzhou government ordered the demolition. Local media reported that the construction was approved illegally. Evergrande said the order won’t affect the rest of the development, on which it has spent 81 billion yuan, the equivalent of $12.8 billion, for more than 60,000 apartments."
