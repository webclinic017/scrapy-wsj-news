    "body": "An unvaccinated father in the Canadian city of Montreal has temporarily lost visitation rights to his 12-year-old because he could expose his child to Covid-19, according to a recent court judgment.<br />The decision is the first in Quebec that deprives a parent of rights over a child because of vaccination status, said Sylvie Schirm, a lawyer specializing in family law who wasn’t involved in the case. It is unusual and possibly the first decision blocking parental rights due to vaccination status."
