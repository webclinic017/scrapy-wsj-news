    "body": "Regarding Mark Oppenheimer’s “The Growing Risk for Jews Who Show Their Jewishness” (Review, Jan. 22): While observant Jews may make easier targets for anti-Semites, it is misguided to believe that Jews can evade anti-Jewish bias by concealing their Jewish identities. This is the wishful thinking of assimilationists who find little of value in their Judaism. They have been unpleasantly surprised throughout history to be made aware of their Jewishness by anti-Semites who view them differently than they view themselves.<br />It behooves Mr. Oppenheimer to take a deeper look to understand why competing ideologies and cultures striving for dominance have come and gone throughout history, while Torah Judaism hasn’t merely survived for thousands of years, but, without seeking to impose its beliefs on others, has profoundly influenced other cultures and is thriving today."
