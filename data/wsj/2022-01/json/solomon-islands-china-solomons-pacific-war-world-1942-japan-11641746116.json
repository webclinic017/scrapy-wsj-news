    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Beijing Courts the Solomon Islands” (Dec. 30): The U.S. and Australia spent a great deal of blood and treasure, fighting in horrendous conditions, to remove the Japanese from the Solomons in 1942 and 1943. For us, it was a strategic goal, but for the people of the Solomons who helped us fight, it was an existential threat. China sent no contingent to the prolonged fight.<br />Our side fought with old weapons, planes and ships against state-of-the-art Japanese equivalents. The fast, heavily armored and powerful U.S. carriers and battleships, as well as superior fighters and dive bombers, didn’t come out until after the Solomons campaign. All we had were good pilots and naval commanders, adequate equipment, good intelligence and radar. Yet by the end of the campaign, the cream of Japanese naval aviation was dead and the people of the Solomons were free of the Japanese."
