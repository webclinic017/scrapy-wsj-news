    "body": "In the past few years, The Wall Street Journal launched a trio of email challenges to help our readers get better at something in their lives, from exercise to money. Each challenge starts when you sign up, and continues with one email a week to your inbox—full of exercises and how-tos—for six weeks.<br />For 2022, we’ve updated and refreshed these short courses for those looking for a project or challenge to kick off the year. While we don’t recommend doing all three challenges at once, we do recommend taking advantage of the fresh-start energy the new year brings and making plans for joy in January."
