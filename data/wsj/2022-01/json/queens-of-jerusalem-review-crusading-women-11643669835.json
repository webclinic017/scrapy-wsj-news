    "body": "Anyone schooled in the history of the Crusades will know of Steven Runciman, arguably the 20th century’s leading popular authority on the period. Interminable, relentlessly detailed and compulsively readable, his canonical three-volume “A History of the Crusades” (1951-54) set the standard—an enduring achievement of manic storytelling.<br />These days, many historians view his work as outdated. He was, after all, an exponent of now-derided perspectives on historiography, such as the “great-man theory” and the “one damn thing after another” approach. The former treated the past as a product of the actions of great or heroic men. The latter, as a chronicle of events rather than a deeper analysis of underlying forces—class struggle, say, or industrialization."
