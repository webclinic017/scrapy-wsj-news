    "body": "Since New York state’s ban on most evictions ended this month the pace of evictions has been slow, as tenant attorneys work to delay cases in court and the governor requested more federal aid for rental assistance.<br />Tens of thousands of tenants are at risk of having to leave their homes because of unpaid rent since New York’s 22-month ban expired two weeks ago. The federal eviction moratorium ended last year."
