    "body": "Bank of America  has shifted its outlook for monetary policy in a decidedly hawkish direction and now expects more rate rises this year than even the most aggressive forecast from a central banker.<br />The Fed is likely to raise its near-zero short-term interest-rate target seven times over the course of this year, on its way to a stopping point of between 2.75% and 3%, wrote Ethan Harris, chief global economist for the bank."
