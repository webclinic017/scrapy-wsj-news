    "body": "Several recent Peggy Noonan columns, including “Biden’s Woes Seem Like Old Times” (Declarations, Jan. 22), have pointed out the failures of President Biden. Previously, Ms. Noonan had ridiculed President Trump for his behavior. Did political correctness lead her to policy error?<br />While we prefer dignity in the White House, it is more important to have secure borders, a nonnuclear Iran, a docile Russia, low inflation and energy independence—all destroyed in a year by negating Trump policy, and still without dignity in the White House. Our president publicly called a reporter a “son of a b—.” Mr. Biden is as rude as any president, and without the success to compensate."
