    "body": "LONDON—British Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced rising political pressure over allegations that he broke lockdown rules by attending a drinks party in Downing Street, as some of his Conservative lawmakers strategized how to oust the British leader and one defected to the opposition Labour Party.<br />Mr. Johnson has acknowledged attending a gathering billed as a “bring your own booze” event in the Downing Street garden during lockdown in May 2020, a time when Britons were only allowed to meet one other person outside. The prime minister has apologized for the incident, adding that he thought it was a work event and wasn’t told it was against the rules."
