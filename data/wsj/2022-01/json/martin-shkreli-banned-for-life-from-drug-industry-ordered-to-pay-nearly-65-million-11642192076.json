    "body": "Martin Shkreli, who was widely criticized as “pharma bro” for raising the price of a lifesaving AIDS drug, was banned for life from the pharmaceutical industry Friday after a federal court found that the imprisoned former executive engaged in illegal and monopolistic behavior.<br />Mr. Shkreli was also ordered to pay nearly $65 million in profits that he and his former company made from illegally boosting prices of the Daraprim drug. That figure is on top of the $40 million that Vyera Pharmaceuticals LLC, which Mr. Shkreli ran as chief executive when it was called Turing Pharmaceuticals AG, was ordered to pay in December in a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission."
