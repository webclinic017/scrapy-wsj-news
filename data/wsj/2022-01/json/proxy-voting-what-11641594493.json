    "body": "For America’s public companies, election day comes every year when common shareholders get to vote on directors, executive compensation and other company issues.<br />But if you are an investor whose primary exposure to stocks is through mutual funds and retirement accounts, your role in this “shareholder democracy” is likely to be limited. That’s because votes aren’t typically awarded to small investors in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. Instead, the asset-management company that runs the fund votes, by proxy, on behalf of the investors."
