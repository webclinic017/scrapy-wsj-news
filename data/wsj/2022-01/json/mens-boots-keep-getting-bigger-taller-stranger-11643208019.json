    "body": "FRENCH LUXURY HOUSE Balenciaga currently sells a boot known as the Bulldozer. Rarely has a product name seemed so apt. This massive boot is as hulking as a John Deere excavator on creatine. Its honking fang-like treads elevate the wearer inches off the ground. The boot’s tall, leather shaft also exceeds the bounds of reason, swallowing one’s calf completely. Even the Bulldozer’s price clocks in at a big-gulp-inducing $1,190.<br />This beast of a boot isn’t the only monster stomping through the footwear market. Bottega Veneta peddles the $1,350 Tire Boot, another calf-consuming Chelsea boot with a seriously large sole. Moncler has issued a series of menacing rubber muck boots that give the wearer an added inch or two. Even Cat Footwear, the brand owned by stalwart construction-equipment company  Caterpillar ,  sells fashion-leaning footwear, including towering, glossy $140 boots that, according to the brand’s website, provide a “futuristic, trend-led finish while protecting you from the elements.”"
