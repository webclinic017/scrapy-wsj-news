    "body": "U.S. job growth for 2021 is poised to hit an annual record, and the economy is positioned to churn out jobs this year despite temporary disruptions from the Omicron variant’s surge, economists say.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimate that hiring strengthened in December as employers added 422,000 jobs, or more than twice the 210,000 added in November. Such payroll gains would leave the U.S. economy with about 6.5 million more jobs than at the end of 2020—more than in any year on record—but 3.5 million jobs short of pre-pandemic levels."
