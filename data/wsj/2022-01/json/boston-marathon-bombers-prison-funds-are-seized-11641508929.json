    "body": "Federal prosecutors are asking a U.S. District Court judge to let them claim the funds in an account held by convicted Boston Marathon Bomber  Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.<br />Prosecutors filed a motion to collect monies Tsarnaev owes in criminal restitution from his inmate trust fund account. They said he has received tens of thousands of dollars—including a Covid-19 relief payment—but has paid only a fraction toward court-issued fines, while spending the money in other ways."
