    "body": "Société Générale SA ’s  vehicle-leasing business,  ALD SA ,  agreed to acquire rival LeasePlan Corporation NV in a cash-and-share deal worth 4.9 billion euros, equivalent to $5.54 billion, the French bank said Thursday.<br />The deal shows how European banks are plumbing further-afield businesses to generate revenue in an era of perennially low interest rates. Chief Executive Frédéric Oudéa said the new unit would eventually become a third pillar alongside the bank’s retail-banking and insurance business lines, as well as its corporate and investment banking units."
