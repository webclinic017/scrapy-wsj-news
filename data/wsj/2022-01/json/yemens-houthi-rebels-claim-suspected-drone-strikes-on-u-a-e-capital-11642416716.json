    "body": "Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed Monday to have carried out suspected drone attacks on two locations in the United Arab Emirates that caused an explosion involving three fuel trucks and a fire at a construction site at Abu Dhabi’s airport, in a rare attack on the neighboring Gulf state which recently intensified its role in the Yemeni war.<br />The Iran-backed Houthis said they had targeted the U.A.E. in a “military operation” in retaliation for its recent escalation in Yemen, where Emirati-backed rebels last week dealt the Houthis an unexpected defeat in the oil-rich province of Shabwa."
