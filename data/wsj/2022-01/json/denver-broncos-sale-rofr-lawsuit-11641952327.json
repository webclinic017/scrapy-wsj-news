    "body": "Denver Broncos brass had publicly discussed wanting to settle the team’s murky ownership situation in early 2022. But first, they had to settle another problem: a claim from a Canadian holding company that said it held the NFL franchise’s rights of first refusal in a sale.<br />Now, a Denver County District Judge has ruled in favor of the Broncos in an order that said the claim is invalid. It was a wonky legal case that now paves the way for one of football’s most storied teams to potentially be sold."
