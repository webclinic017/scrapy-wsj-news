    "body": "Much of the Biden administration’s vaccination mandate for larger employers went into effect Monday despite the possibility the Supreme Court could halt the rule as it considers a legal challenge to it.<br />As of Jan. 10, all employers with more than 100 employees must have a procedure in place to ensure employees are vaccinated and keep track of workers’ vaccination status. Employers must also track whether their workers are infected and keep those who test positive away from work. Workers who aren’t vaccinated must wear a mask while indoors."
