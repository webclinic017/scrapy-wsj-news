    "body": "On Sunday night, in their third attack in as many weeks, Houthi radicals in Yemen unleashed a new barrage of ballistic and cruise missiles and weaponized drones against civilian sites across the United Arab Emirates.<br />U.A.E. and U.S. air defenses knocked most from the sky. Some got through earlier in January, landing at and around Abu Dhabiâ€™s international airport. Three innocent Indian and Pakistani residents of the U.A.E. were killed. But the tragedy could have been larger. More than 32,000 international travelers pass through the airport every day. More than 65,000 Americans live in the U.A.E., among more than eight million foreign residents from nearly every country. On Sunday, Isaac Herzog began the first ever visit to the U.A.E. by an Israeli president to meet with U.A.E. leaders and visit the Israeli pavilion at the World Expo in Dubai."
