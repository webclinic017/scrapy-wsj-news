    "body": "New York<br />‘Gillian Wearing: Wearing Masks,” an unnerving exhibition at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, will have visitors wondering if they can ever trust the neutrality of a camera again. For much of the past 30 years, the 58-year-old British Conceptual artist, who won the Turner Prize in 1997, has questioned the veracity of documentary photography and confessional videos. Her diverse body of work, based in performance and centered on issues of social and personal identity, has sought to undermine complacent axioms about portraiture by incorporating masks and makeup, as well as actors and crowds, into the making of her provocative art."
