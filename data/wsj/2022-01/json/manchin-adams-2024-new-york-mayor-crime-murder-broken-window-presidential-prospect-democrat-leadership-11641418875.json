    "body": "And so it came to pass in 2022 that the major political parties in the United States were led by two late septuagenarians. Politico purported over the New Year’s weekend that Donald Trump holds “dominion” over the Republicans, while Joe Biden promises he’ll be on the Democrats’ ticket, health willing, in 2024. But if you can gaze past those two wintry subjects, American politics actually looks interesting again.<br />In one-party New York City, of all places, its new mayor, Eric Adams, says: “Look at me and you’re seeing the future of the Democratic Party.” Seriously? And he doesn’t stop there: “If the Democratic Party fails to recognize what we did here in New York, they’re going to have a problem in the midterm elections and they’re going to have a problem in the presidential election.”"
