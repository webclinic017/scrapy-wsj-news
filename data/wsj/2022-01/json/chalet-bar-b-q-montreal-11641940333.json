    "body": "For the Time Capsule series, we spotlight a cherished restaurant, hotel or landmark that’s changed remarkably little over the years. This week, we visit Chalet Bar-B-Q in Montreal.<br />Even during the late World War II years, Canada, far from European and Pacific combat, had a relatively strong consumer economy. That helped make Chalet Bar-B-Q—the Montreal restaurant focused on rotisserie chicken that Swiss visionary Marcel Mauron conceived in 1944—an instant success. The chickens were cooked in the middle of the dining room and the menu was precise: You could order anything you wanted as long as it was chicken, french fries, dipping sauce, coleslaw and apple pie, and you consumed it amid knotty pine paneling and framed Alpine scenes."
