    "body": "Washington surveyed the conventional-wisdom landscape this week for the answer to what ails the Biden presidency—and, as usual, came up wrong. If the White House doesn’t hit on the obvious answer soon, Joe Biden risks permanent failure.<br />One year in, Gallup reports that Mr. Biden’s ratings have plunged by double digits, with only 40% of Americans approving of his performance. He also gets the award for most polarizing first-year president—beating even Donald Trump. Covid is still raging, inflation is ballooning, foreign policy is a mess, and his domestic agenda has hit a wall. In a Politico/Morning Consult poll this week, 49% of Americans gave the Biden presidency a grade of D (12%) or F (37%)."
