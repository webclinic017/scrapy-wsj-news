    "body": "Ukraine has become the focus of geopolitical attention in recent weeks as a Russian troop buildup along its eastern border has prompted threats of sanctions by the West and military deployment by NATO allies. Here’s a look at the origins of the standoff and the motivations behind Russian movements in the region.<br />Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union before it collapsed at the end of the Cold War in 1991, and it borders Russia to its east. The disintegration of the Soviet Union left Russia with a vastly depleted population, territory and economy. It also diminished Russia’s superpower status. Now Russian President Vladimir Putin is seeking to reclaim some of that glory and undo some of what Russia lost in the Cold War."
