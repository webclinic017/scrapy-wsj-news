    "body": "LONDON—Members of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s cabinet urged Conservative lawmakers, disgruntled over the prime minister’s attendance of a party during lockdown, to wait for an official probe to conclude before deciding whether to oust their leader.<br />The allegations of rule-breaking in 2020 leave Mr. Johnson, a famed political Houdini, facing one of his toughest acts to date.
