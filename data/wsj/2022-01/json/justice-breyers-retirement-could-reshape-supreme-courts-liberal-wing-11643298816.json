    "body": "Justice Stephen Breyer’s retirement, which he officially announced Thursday in a letter to President Biden, is likely to bring significant changes to the Supreme Court’s diminished liberal minority, even if his departure won’t alter the overall balance of power on a court where conservatives maintain a 6-3 supermajority.<br />Over his 27-year tenure, Justice Breyer, the most moderate of the court’s three current liberal justices, has been a bridge builder who favored a pragmatic approach to the law. That judicial stance was reinforced by his years on the bench alongside Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, a pivotal moderate conservative who retired in 2006 and was one of his closest friends on the court."
