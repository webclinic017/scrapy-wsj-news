    "body": "You report on people moving during Covid in droves from states that relied heavily on lockdowns, school closures and other restrictions to states that were more laissez faire (“The Great Pandemic Migration,” Review & Outlook, Dec. 29). This pattern of migration is powerful evidence against the applicability of the chief economic argument used to justify these policies.<br />That argument starts by asserting that these policies are the best means of preventing the negative externality of some people inflicting harm on innocent third parties. The argument then further asserts that, while each individual suffers a real cost of being inconvenienced, nearly everyone judges the benefits to be worth this cost. Thus these restrictive policies serve the public interest."
