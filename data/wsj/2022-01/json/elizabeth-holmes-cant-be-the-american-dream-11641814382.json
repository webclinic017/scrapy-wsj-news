    "body": "There has long been a stereotype of Silicon Valley venture capitalists as those who chase narratives rather than numbers. Lately, the notion has permeated the masses.<br />Last week, fallen biotechnology founder Elizabeth Holmes was convicted of defrauding some of her blood-testing company’s biggest investors. A so-called startup, Theranos at its peak was valued at more than $9 billion and, as of 2018, had raised over $1 billion, according to PitchBook, despite giving inaccurate blood-test results to some patients who have said they were falsely told they had HIV or cancer. Ms. Holmes was found not guilty of four charges involving patients."
