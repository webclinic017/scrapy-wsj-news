    "body": "Regarding Andy Kessler’s “Is Climate Change in Your Top 10?” (Inside View, Jan. 10): My top-10 list of concerns contains only three fundamental items. First, the economic illiteracy of many government leaders. This gives us policies with perverse incentives (paying people not to work during a labor shortage, killing energy production as prices soar), as well as staggering national debt, bloated government and increasing inflation.<br />Second, the increasing limitations on free speech. Without free speech, we cannot debate the issues or even attempt to reveal some truths. Science becomes politics, and policy isn’t based on all the facts. We need to defend free speech, our most basic freedom, and end cancel culture."
