    "body": "DirecTV said Friday it plans to drop conservative news channel One America News Network, a move that could sharply reduce the pro-Trump channel’s audience.<br />“We informed Herring Networks that, following a routine internal review, we do not plan to enter into a new contract when our current agreement expires,” a DirecTV spokesman said in a statement, referring to OAN’s owner. He didn’t say when OAN will go off-air."
