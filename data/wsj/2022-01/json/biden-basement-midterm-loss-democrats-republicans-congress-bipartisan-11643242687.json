    "body": "Kimberley Strassel hits the mark in identifying “What Ails the Biden Presidency” (Potomac Watch, Jan. 21). But in discussing a potential Republican takeover of Congress, she states that President Biden will “be forced to rule through executive action, which he’ll have to defend before a skeptical Supreme Court.”<br />Since when did losing majorities in Congress require a president to give up on making legislative progress? As I recall, President Clinton’s greatest achievements occurred in conjunction with Speaker Newt Gingrich and a Republican Congress. President Reagan passed his truly sweeping reform agenda through a Democratic House led by the legendary Speaker Tip O’Neill. Perhaps it’s time for Mr. Biden to work with the other party. Besides getting him some easy wins, it would allow him to show a characteristic he has yet to demonstrate: leadership."
