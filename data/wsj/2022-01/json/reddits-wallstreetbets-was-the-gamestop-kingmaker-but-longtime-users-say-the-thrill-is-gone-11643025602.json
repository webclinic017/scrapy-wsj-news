    "body": "Reddit’s WallStreetBets was the place to be last year for meme-stock mania. These days, some one-time fans say it is hardly worth clicking on.<br />Those who once scoured the online message forum for brazen and unexpected trading ideas say they are mostly finding members still chatting about stocks such as  GameStop Corp.  and  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.  Constructive feedback on trades, some users complain, has largely been replaced by cheerleading. Devotees who were once glued to the forum—watching power users like Keith Gill, or “DeepF—ingValue,” post bold bets on GameStop—say they have largely abandoned the page in favor of other trading communities."
