    "body": "Everyone needs conversation, but some people need more of it than others. I am someone who needs more. I could connect my need for conversation to Freud’s “talking cure.” He developed the idea of talk therapy with his colleague Joseph Breuer. Breuer’s patient “Anna O” (her real name was Bertha Pappenheim) coined the phrase “talking cure” to refer to the free-associative talk used to unearth the trauma that underlay her symptoms.<br />Although it would be inaccurate to equate my mild neuroses to the symptoms suffered by Freud’s patients, I do believe that conversation is my therapy. For people like me, the pandemic has been particularly difficult. It has made it impossible to engage with friends over drinks or dinner, or to chat with colleagues over lunch or coffee."
