    "body": "Many failings of the post-9/11 security structure are rightly under scrutiny. After 20 years, almost 2,500 servicemen and -women killed, and $2.3 trillion spent, Afghanistan is once again under the control of the Taliban. America’s invasion of Iraq distracted the U.S. from more pressing threats and paved the way for a bolstered Iran and radical Sunni groups like ISIS. And yet, despite the obvious failures, there hasn’t been another terrorist attack on a similarly large scale. Why is that? Our security apparatus has clearly done something right.<br />Perhaps the most spectacular success in preventing another attack was a joint operation, in the mid-2000s, against a plot to down seven airliners as they traveled from London’s Heathrow Airport to destinations in the U.S. and Canada. The race to thwart the attack is well documented in “Disruption” by Aki J. Peritz, a former CIA analyst. The Overt plot, as it was known to security officials, was planned by an al Qaeda cell operating in the Walthamstow neighborhood of London and the town of High Wycombe outside the city. For those tasked with keeping the homelands safe on both sides of the Atlantic, it was either a near miss or a great triumph, depending on how one chooses to look at it."
