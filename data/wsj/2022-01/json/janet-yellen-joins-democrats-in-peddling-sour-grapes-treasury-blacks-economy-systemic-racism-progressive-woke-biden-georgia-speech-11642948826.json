    "body": "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen made a stunning remark while celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Correctly noting that King “knew that economic injustice was bound up in the larger injustice he fought against,” she claimed: “From Reconstruction, to Jim Crow, to the present day, our economy has never worked fairly for black Americans—or, really, for any American of color.”<br />Saying America’s economy has “never” worked fairly for “any American of color” defines those Americans merely by one particular statistical community to which they belong. The claim refuses to treat them as individuals, eviscerating any personal story of success, of defying odds, of building a better life. Such sweeping pessimism also lacks historical context and a broader perspective comparing the American standard of living with the rest of the world’s."
