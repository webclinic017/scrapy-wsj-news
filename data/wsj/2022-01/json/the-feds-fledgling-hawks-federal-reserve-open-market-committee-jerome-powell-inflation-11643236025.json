    "body": "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday showed new determination to fight rising prices, but the fledgling inflation hawks are only learning to fly. The central bank’s moves were modest given inflation of 7%, and it isn’t clear how much resolve the central bank will have if asset prices keep falling in response to the prospect of rising interest rates.<br />As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee signaled an end to its bond purchases and a rate increase in March from near-zero today. This is hardly monetary tightening. The Fed could have gone cold turkey on bond buying, but it chose to keep assisting asset prices for a half dozen more weeks or so."
