    "body": "Wall Street’s hottest investment trend is to score companies on environmental, social and governance criteria, in an attempt to steer investors away from potholes.  Credit Suisse ’s  investors might have expected a corporate governance disaster based on its ESG scores—but only if they picked the right ratings agency. With the Swiss bank achieving excellent, terrible or indifferent scores depending on the agency, one is almost bound to be right.<br />Credit Suisse has just lost its chairman, António Horta-Osório, who quit after it turned out he had repeatedly breached Covid-19 quarantine rules. The current chief executive got the job after the last one was forced out after the revelation that a former employee was spied on. Both had been trying to rebuild Credit Suisse after board reports about botched risk controls and heavy losses on lending to failed hedge fund Archegos Capital Management and supply-chain financier Greensill Capital."
