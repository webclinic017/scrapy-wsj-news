    "body": "WASHINGTON—Former President Donald Trump has said he would consider pardoning people convicted in connection to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol if he runs for re-election in 2024 and wins, drawing a rebuke from some Republicans and plaudits from at least one GOP lawmaker.<br />At a rally in Texas on Saturday night, Mr. Trump said, “If I run and I win, we will treat those people from Jan. 6 fairly.” He went on to say that “if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons, because they are being treated so unfairly.”"
