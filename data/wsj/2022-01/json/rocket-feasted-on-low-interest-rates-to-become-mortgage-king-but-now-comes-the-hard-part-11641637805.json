    "body": "Rocket  Cos. struck it big selling the American Dream. Now it has to convince investors it can keep growing even in a sleepy mortgage market.<br />The Detroit-based lender has barreled through the pandemic. It doubled its mortgage originations in 2020 and grew them by another third through last fall. It is now the biggest mortgage lender in the country, making nearly as many home loans as Wells Fargo & Co. and  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. combined. Through much of 2021, roughly one out of every 14 mortgages in the U.S. went through Rocket."
