    "sub_head": "The Russell 2000 index of small companies has fallen 9.4% this year. Almost a third of the index is made up of companies with no profit",
    "category_1": "Markets",
    "time": "2022-01-25 05:30:00",
    "body": "The prospect of rising interest rates has been especially hard on the Russell 2000 small-cap index, in large part because of the high proportion of small-caps that arenâ€™t making money.<br />During the market selloff of recent weeks, investors have been shedding speculative investments from tech stocks to cryptocurrencies. Speculative investments with their promise of higher returns thrived in the ultra-low-rate environment of 2021. Now that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates as soon as March to combat inflation, investors are less comfortable with risk."
