    "body": "Europe’s growing dependence on Russian gas and oil is limiting the continent’s room to maneuver in the mounting U.S.-Russia crisis over security in the region and making it highly vulnerable in the event of an escalation.<br />Officials from the U.S., Russia and Europe meet Thursday in Vienna at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to discuss the tensions. Earlier this week, the U.S. and Russia failed to narrow differences over Moscow’s deployment of more than 100,000 troops along the border with Ukraine, a major thoroughfare for gas consumed in Western Europe, and Moscow’s demands for changes to Europe’s security architecture. Russia has denied preparing to invade its western neighbor."
