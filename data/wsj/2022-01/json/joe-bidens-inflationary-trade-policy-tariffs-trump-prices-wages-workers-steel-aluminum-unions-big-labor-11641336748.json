    "body": "According to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the cause of rising prices isn’t “simply some inevitable economic force of nature—it’s greed.” The Biden administration, following Ms. Warren’s lead, has unleashed the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division to find the culprits.<br />Strong stuff, but they’re actually on to something: Greed is causing at least some of the high prices American consumers pay every time they go shopping. Yet the villains aren’t the companies the Biden administration lawyers are targeting. The real culprit is closer to home—the White House’s own “worker-centric” trade policies, which are gouging American consumers and helping to stoke inflationary price increases."
