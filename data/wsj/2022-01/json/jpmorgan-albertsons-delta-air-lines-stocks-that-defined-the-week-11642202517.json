    "body": "JPMorgan Chase  & Co.<br />The trading boom is slowing down. JPMorgan on Friday said its quarterly profit dropped 14%, and  Citigroup ’s  fourth-quarter profit fell 26% as both Wall Street giants reported falling trading revenue. Wild markets powered trading revenue and banks’ profits throughout the pandemic, but executives have said they expect a further retreat toward 2019 levels in coming months. Despite the slowdown, JPMorgan notched a record for annual profit in 2021. JPMorgan shares lost 6.2% Friday."
