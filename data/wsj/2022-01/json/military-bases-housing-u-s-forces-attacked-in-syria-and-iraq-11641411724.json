    "body": "Rockets and indirect fire struck bases hosting U.S.-led military coalition forces in Iraq and Syria in at least three separate attacks Wednesday, the third day in a row that Iran-aligned paramilitary groups have targeted America and its partners in the Middle East.<br />The latest spate of attacks started on Monday as the militias marked the second anniversary of the American strike that killed senior Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in January 2020. Iran and its allies in the region have sworn to avenge Gen. Soleimaniâ€™s death by attacking U.S. forces and driving the American military out of the region."
