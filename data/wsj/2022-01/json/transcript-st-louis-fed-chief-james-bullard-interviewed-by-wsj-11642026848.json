    "body": "Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said the U.S. central bank should start raising interest rates “sooner rather than later,” and that he sees a March rate rise as likely amid high inflation. He also said a strong job market could push the unemployment rate to under 3% this year, during an interview with The Wall Street Journal’s Michael S. Derby on Wednesday.
