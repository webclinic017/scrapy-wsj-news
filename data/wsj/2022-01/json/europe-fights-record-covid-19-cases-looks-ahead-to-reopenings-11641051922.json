    "body": "Europe rang in the New Year in a subdued fashion, as several countries reported record Covid-19 infections and governments considered how to contain the virus when workers return to offices and children go back to school.<br />Fireworks displays and large public gatherings were scrapped or scaled back for New Year’s Eve across the continent despite early data suggesting the Omicron variant produces a milder form of disease than its predecessors. Hospitals are bracing for a flood of patients because of increased social contacts over the festive period and the high transmissibility of the strain."
