    "body": "The jury in the criminal-fraud trial of Theranos Inc. founder Elizabeth Holmes said on Monday it has been unable to reach a unanimous verdict on three of the 11 counts. The jury is now on their seventh day of deliberations.<br />The defense rested on Dec. 8, 2021, in the trial of Ms. Holmes, founder of Theranos, a startup that promised to revolutionize the blood-testing industry. Ms. Holmes is charged with defrauding patients and investors. Closing arguments took place on Dec. 16 and Dec. 17. The jury was handed the case on Dec. 17 and began deliberating in earnest the following Monday. On Jan. 3, 2022, the seventh day of deliberations, the jury informed the judge that they had been unable to reach a unanimous verdict on three of the 11 counts. The judge gave them an additional instruction to keep deliberating, telling them to, “Take as much time as you need to discuss things. There is no hurry.” The instruction also urged them not to change their beliefs solely because of the opinions of their fellow jurors."
