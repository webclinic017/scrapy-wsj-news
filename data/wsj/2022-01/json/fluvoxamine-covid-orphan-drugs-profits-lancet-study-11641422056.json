    "body": "I’m glad Allysia Finley highlighted the Lancet article by Gilmar Reis and colleagues (“Is Fluvoxamine the Covid Drug We’ve Been Waiting For?” op-ed, Dec. 29). But the results are not as simple as she described. The clinical benefits were seen in patients treated within seven days, outpatient only, and with a risk factor. The study participants, however, do not align with this protocol based on Table 1 in the Lancet article, calling into question the internal validity of the study’s results.<br />Many patients were also excluded from the study, including people with mental-health disorders, respiratory disorders and pregnancy, as well as those who are vaccinated, which calls into question the external validity of the study’s results."
