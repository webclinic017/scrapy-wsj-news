    "body": "For far too long, TV remotes were ugly, clunky, button-filled clickers that were easy to lose between your couch cushions and hard to use. They’re now getting an update as companies try to make technology that blends more seamlessly into our lives.<br />TV makers are shipping next-generation remotes that are easier to find, power and use. Some companies unveiled revamped controllers at the CES electronics conference in January, generating more excitement in some corners than the newest TVs. (We included two on our “Best of CES” list—but no televisions made the cut.) The new  Samsung Electronics  remote draws energy in a more efficient way, while one from  Sony Group  lets you talk to the TV’s voice assistant to locate the remote when you’ve lost it."
