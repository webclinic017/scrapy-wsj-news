    "body": "TUCKED INTO a 1926 Tudor-style home, Katie Rosenfeld’s parlor is plush with comfortable furnishings in such semisweet patterns as the ticking stripes of the roll-arm sofa. “It has very Anglo-Indian vibes,” said the interior designer of her sitting room in Wellesley, Mass. “All the elements are there.
