    "body": "Blackstone Inc.  has launched a credit strategy to back companies that help reduce carbon emissions, an initiative that fits into the asset manager’s plan to invest $100 billion in such businesses during the next decade.<br />The private-capital giant, with about $731 billion in assets under management, has a variety of other investment strategies, such as energy, infrastructure and private equity, that it can draw on to help meet that goal. Blackstone’s new sustainable resources credit platform seeks to benefit from the massive capital requirements—estimated at more than $100 trillion by the International Renewable Energy Agency—needed by 2050 to shift the world economy to clean energy."
