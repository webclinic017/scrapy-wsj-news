    "body": "I decided to run for the U.S. Senate in 2010 because growing entitlements and out-of-control federal spending had exploded our national debt to $14 trillion. We were on an unsustainable path that was mortgaging our children’s future.<br />Fortunately, Americans decided that government controlled by liberal Democrats wasn’t good for the country and they elected Republicans to the House to halt President Obama’s extreme policies. A Republican majority in the Senate followed in 2014."
