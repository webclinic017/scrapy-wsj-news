    "body": "On the morning of Jan. 15, as usual, I picked up the Journal from the driveway, poured a cup of coffee and started reading the paper cover to cover. Almar Latour’s publisher’s letter (“A Report to Our Readers”) was an unexpected synthesis of the Journal’s activities and principles in lieu of the readers’ letters. I have been a loyal subscriber for more years than I care to remember, and Mr. Latour nicely summarizes why. The Journal costs more than three of my streaming services taken together, but its value well exceeds theirs.<br />I write to tell you that I take Mr. Latour’s letter as a commitment. I expect the Journal not to waver or bend to the dogmas du jour. I hold you to your word every morning."
