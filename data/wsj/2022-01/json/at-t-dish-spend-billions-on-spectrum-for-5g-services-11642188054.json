    "body": "AT&T Inc.  and  Dish Network Corp.  topped the list of bidders for a swath of wireless spectrum previously reserved for military use, offering a new test for telecom companies seeking to share the air with other users.<br />The Federal Communications Commission on Friday said AT&T spent $9.1 billion and Dish spent $7.3 billion to secure rights to use the airwaves, which sit above 3.45 gigahertz on the radio spectrum.  T-Mobile US Inc.  spent $2.9 billion, while  Verizon Communications Inc.  spent nothing. Such midrange frequencies are considered ideal for carrying wireless companies’ faster fifth-generation signals across urban and suburban areas."
