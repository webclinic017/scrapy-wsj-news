    "body": "Starbucks Corp.  is requiring its U.S. employees to be vaccinated against Covid-19 or submit to regular testing, one of the first large restaurant chains to take such a step ahead of potential federal vaccination mandates for large employers.<br />Starbucks said Monday that workers in its U.S. cafes, offices and manufacturing plants must be vaccinated by Feb. 9 or get tested weekly. Workers who choose testing must have a pharmacist or doctor administer it instead of taking one at home, and workers will need to themselves obtain and cover any costs for the tests, the company said in a message to U.S. stores."
