    "body": "Donald Trump did the country—and himself—a favor by canceling the press conference he had planned for Jan. 6. But the press statement he released instead on Thursday underscores that the former President will never admit that he lost the 2020 election, no matter the cost to the country or his supporters.<br />Mr. Trump’s statement throws out a farrago of “questions” about the election intended to imply massive fraud that he could never prove in court, in Congress or in subsequent state audits. He asks how Mr. Biden could lose “27 out of 27 ‘toss up’ House races, but somehow miraculously receive the most votes in American history with no coattails?”"
