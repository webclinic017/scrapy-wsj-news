    "body": "AFTER FEEDING GUESTS in her Atlanta restaurants for nearly three decades, chef Anne Quatrano knows their appetites, and the way they shift with the seasons. “In the New Year people are thinking about eating less meat and more vegetables,” she said. “This recipe is perfect for that.” Just a few thin slices of prosciutto give this warm potato salad a rich flavor and feel. Fresh herbs, tart apple slices, curls of Parmesan and a mustard-shallot vinaigrette round out this comforting meal and give it an invigorating punch.<br />Waxy fingerling potatoes hold their shape and their satisfying texture once they’ve boiled, and you’ll want to get them into that mustardy vinaigrette right away after cooking. “I peel each one by hand and then slice it directly into the dressing,” Ms. Quatrano said. “Potatoes are so porous. They need to be seasoned while they’re hot.” The potatoes should be quite dry before you dress them, too, for maximum absorption. Toss the apple slices in lemon juice to prevent browning, and add them just before serving to preserve their snap."
