    "body": "Cartier gems likely made it into a record number of Christmas stockings last month. Bulgari and Tiffany & Co. should also benefit from sparkling demand for expensive jewelry.<br />Richemont, the Swiss luxury goods company that owns Cartier and Piaget, said Wednesday that group sales for the three months through December increased almost a third compared with the same quarter of 2020. Its shares gained 8% in early trading. Most of Europe’s big luxury names have sold off this year as investors dumped growth stocks. Richemont’s results are the first sign that demand for the expensive goods the sector sells is holding up."
