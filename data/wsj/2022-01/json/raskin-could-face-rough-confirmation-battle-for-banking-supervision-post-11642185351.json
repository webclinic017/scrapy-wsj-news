    "body": "WASHINGTON—Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Biden’s pick to become the Fed’s top banking regulator, could face a contentious nomination process due to her support for tougher banking rules and for using financial regulation to address climate-change positions cheered by progressives but criticized by some Republicans.<br />Still, Ms. Raskin is unlikely to face the kind of industry opposition that helped torpedo the nomination of Saule Omarova, an academic Mr. Biden tapped last year for a separate post overseeing national banks. That fight was led by community banks who have a more favorable view of Ms. Raskin from her former stints in government."
