    "body": "SEOUL— Samsung Electronics Co.  is forecasting a roughly 52% jump in its fourth-quarter operating profit from the year-ago period, lifted by resilient demand for memory chips and improved returns from its contract chip-making business.<br />The world’s largest smartphone and memory-chip maker expects operating profit of about 13.8 trillion South Korean won, equivalent to about $11.4 billion, for the quarter ended Dec. 31. That compares with about 9.05 trillion won for the year-earlier quarter."
