    "body": "WASHINGTON—A Senate panel approved antitrust legislation forbidding the largest tech platforms from favoring their own products and services over competitors’, scoring a win for backers of stricter Big Tech regulation against fierce industry opposition.<br />The American Innovation and Choice Online Act moves next to the Senate floor, where several senators said they wanted to see additional changes before backing the measure. Thursday’s 16-6 vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee showed the bill had bipartisan support but also raised bipartisan concerns."
