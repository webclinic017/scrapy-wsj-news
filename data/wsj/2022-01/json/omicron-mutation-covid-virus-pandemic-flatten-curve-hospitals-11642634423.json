    "body": "In “Slow the Spread? Speeding It May Be Safer” (op-ed, Jan. 11), Vivek and Apoorva Ramaswamy make an interesting argument. They suggest that the current cautious response to the relatively “less deadly” Omicron variant could facilitate the development of a disastrous “supervariant.”<br />Three points, however, deserve special scrutiny. First, the number of mutations and the opportunity for forming new variants is not increased by depriving the viruses of new hosts by masking and social distancing. On the contrary, the occurrence of more infections increases the opportunity for replication of the virus, which is when mutations occur."
