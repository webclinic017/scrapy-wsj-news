    "body": "Bitcoin rallied on Monday afternoon, trading above $37,000, after falling to a seven-month low in the morning, as the cryptocurrency moved in lockstep with a swift rally in risk assets.<br />Bitcoin was most recently up about 4.3% at $36,920, according to data from CoinDesk. In the morning, it traded below $33,000 for the first time since July. That extended its selloff to a more than 50% loss from its record high of $68,990.90, set on Nov. 10."
