    "body": "UBS Group AG  doubled profit in its U.S. wealth business over the past five years by wooing rich families with white-glove service. For its next act, it is going after the not-as-rich with cheaper digital advice.<br />The Swiss bank bills itself as one of the world’s largest wealth managers, with access to more than half of all billionaires, and managing $3.2 trillion invested assets. It was on track at the end of the third quarter to make $2 billion in pretax profit in its Americas wealth unit for 2021."
