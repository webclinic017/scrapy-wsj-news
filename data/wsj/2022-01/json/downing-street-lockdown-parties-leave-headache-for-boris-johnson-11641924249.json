    "body": "LONDON—British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under growing pressure from Conservative lawmakers as a string of allegations about parties in Downing Street during Covid-19 lockdowns contribute to the ruling party’s sharp fall in the polls.<br />This week an email surfaced from a senior adviser to Mr. Johnson inviting around 100 people to a “bring your own booze” event at the garden outside the prime minister’s Downing Street residence in May 2020. At the time, English rules permitted meeting with only one other person outdoors."
