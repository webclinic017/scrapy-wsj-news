    "body": "Mitch Landrieu had been mayor of New Orleans for more than seven years when torrential rains in August 2017 exposed a failing drainage system, triggering floods that evoked memories of Hurricane Katrina a dozen years earlier.<br />Mr. Landrieu helped revive a city that was nearly bankrupt and reeling from corruption probes when he took office in 2010. Still, he spent his final months as mayor explaining why the New Orleans infrastructure was failing, even after he’d secured billions of dollars in federal aid for post-Katrina repairs."
