    "body": "WASHINGTON—The White House is planning to re-engage with Sen. Joe Manchin on President Biden’s signature education, healthcare and climate package, hoping to take a more muted approach to negotiations as some frustrated Democratic lawmakers push for passing pieces of the agenda individually instead.<br />The West Virginia Democrat rejected the roughly $2 trillion proposal in December, saying it was too big and too costly, after months of near-daily media coverage of his negotiations with Mr. Biden and party leaders. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) had also raised concerns about portions of the “Build Back Better” package, and the White House hasn’t specified how it might seek to alter or slim down the package to win their support."
