    "body": "Fintech companies have established themselves as viable competitors in the financial-services business, but now they face a new challenge: Some mainstream banks have started to offer fintech-inspired services such as early paycheck access and no-fee overdrafts.<br />So how are fintechs that offer banking services staying relevant? How are they competing with traditional banks that have a longstanding customer base and deeper pockets? Fintechs, taking advantage of their technological prowess and lower costs, are offering more features that banks generally don’t, such as analysis of customers’ spending and saving patterns, credit-builder products and lending products designed specifically for consumers who banks don’t typically target, like individuals with little or poor credit history. Fintechs also are placing bets on up-and-coming services such as helping consumers plan to reach their savings goals, cryptocurrency investing and crowdfunding."
