    "body": "A recent ruling under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement fails to address the problems confronting dairy farmers in any meaningful way (“U.S. Wins Ruling on Canada Dairy Tariffs,” U.S. News, Jan. 5). On the contrary, it dismisses the positive example of Canada’s dairy supply-management program, which has stabilized the supply of milk, provided protective subsidies to small farmers, ensured most of the dairy production is consumed domestically and offered fairer prices to farmers and consumers.<br />Canada’s quota system has enabled dairy farmers to invest in more sustainable, climate-friendly farming practices. Their average dairy herd size is 97 cows, allowing more opportunities for pasture grazing and soil carbon sequestration. This combination of minimal emissions and maximum soil carbon retention constitutes one of the most positive versions of dairy production."
