    "body": "On my 64th birthday last August, at an age when people commonly step back and slow down, I began a new career as a human rights activist. As president of the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong, I’m fighting for the release of political prisoners in a city that was until recently one of the freest in the world. I never imagined this for myself. But then, what has happened in Hong Kong was once unimaginable, too.<br />For three decades as a journalist, author and head of the Hong Kong-based Asia Business Council, I was a proponent of engagement with China. My work rested on the belief that more open trade and a shared desire for economic prosperity would bind China and the world more closely together. I’d lived in and reported from South Korea during its democratic transition in the late 1980s and envisioned something similar for China’s future."
