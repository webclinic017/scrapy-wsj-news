    "body": "Through my adult life, I read books such as Philip Roth’s “The Plot Against America” and Sinclair Lewis’s “It Can’t Happen Here” with bemused interest. The counterfactuals were intriguing—what if an American version of Hitler had come to power?—but of no practical significance. I read Lewis’s title unironically: It really couldn’t happen here.<br />Over the past year, I’ve started to wonder. I’m torn between fear of complacency and fear of alarmism. Was the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol the result of a singular confluence of events or a harbinger of worse to come? Am I suffering from a failure of imagination or an excess of it?"
