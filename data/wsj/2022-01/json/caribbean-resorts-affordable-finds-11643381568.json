    "body": "FOR ANYONE eager to thaw out this winter on a sun-drenched beach in the Caribbean, a word of caution: Brace yourself for sticker shock. Room rates at the luxury hotels have risen considerably since before the pandemic, nearly 25% in some cases, said Melissa Pugh, a Jet World Travel consultant who specializes in high-end Caribbean vacations. “Covid was very expensive for a lot of hotels and still is,” she explained, attributing the price hike, in part, to staffing shortages and enhanced cleaning and safety protocols. Yet, even the soaring costs aren’t enough to quell demand, and the region’s most popular luxury resorts are rapidly booking up.<br />Luckily, thrifty sunseekers can still find reasonably affordable, attractive accommodations scattered throughout the Caribbean. Below, we’ve zeroed in on six favorites, from a 155-room resort in Belize to a four-bedroom villa in Tobago. They may not be as well-known as their competitors but they’re well located—on or near the sea—and uncrowded. As for the current Covid regulations, each country has its own set of requirements. Be sure to inquire with the hotel before booking about the most recent vaccination and testing policies in place and check the latest health information on the CDC website."
