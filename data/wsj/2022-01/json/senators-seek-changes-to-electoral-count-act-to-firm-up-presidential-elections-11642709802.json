    "body": "WASHINGTON—With Democrats’ sweeping voting-access legislation hitting a dead end, a bipartisan group of senators is turning to possible areas of compromise on narrower but critical parts of elections rules, including changing an 1887 law that governs how Congress deals with presidential election disputes.<br />Republicans in recent weeks have started talking about making changes to the Electoral Count Act in an effort to stop a repeat of what happened following the 2020 election. Then-President Donald Trump, a Republican, had urged then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject the Electoral College votes from some states, which he declined to do. That same day, the Capitol was overrun by a pro-Trump mob seeking to stop the certification of the election victory of President Biden, a Democrat."
