    "body": "On Thursday, British tabloids published a grainy photograph of Prince Andrew riding in the back of a Range Rover on his way to see his mother, Queen Elizabeth.<br />It was a rare image of a royal who has largely disappeared from public view. Hours after the photo appeared, Buckingham Palace announced the 61-year-old prince was stripped of his patronages and titles—including that of High Royal Highness—as the British monarchy looks to insulate itself from the reputational damage caused by a continuing legal case alleging the prince sexually abused a 17-year-old girl. Prince Andrew has denied all the allegations."
