    "body": "The unnamed narrator of Antoine Wilson’s “Mouth to Mouth” is a struggling writer who learns much more than he expects from Jeff Cook, an old college acquaintance he encounters, after 20 years, at New York’s JFK Airport. Like the Ancient Mariner in the Coleridge poem, Cook is in a confessional mood. Fueled by alcohol in the airport lounge, waiting for an international connection, he launches into a long story which begins: “Not long after college . . . I was, through no planning or forethought on my part, responsible for saving a man’s life.”<br />The rescued man, it turns out, is Francis Arsenault, a well-known Southern California art dealer who Cook pulled from the Pacific surf and resuscitated after a near fatal heart attack. Cook doesn’t reveal himself to Arsenault, but he does shadow the dealer around Beverly Hills to make sure he is fully recovered and to find out what sort of man he’s provided with a second chance at life."
