    "body": "Crude prices rose to their highest level since the 2014 shale-induced oil crash, a milestone in a rally that is gathering momentum as geopolitical tensions threaten to knock supply.<br />Futures for West Texas Intermediate, the main grade of U.S. crude, added 1.7% to $85.20 a barrel Tuesday morning. If the contracts settle above $84.65 a barrel, it will mark their highest closing level since October 2014, when oil prices were moving in the opposite direction as a gusher of U.S. crude flooded the market."
