    "body": "Joel Zinberg points out that while list prices for some drugs have increased, average drug costs have risen more slowly, or even fallen (“Drug Prices Haven’t Been Going Up,” op-ed, Dec. 27). These two trends are intimately connected.<br />Before widespread use of generic drugs, pharmaceutical companies could count on a long run of moderate prices to earn back their investments in drug research and development. But with the acceptance of generics, prescription drugs must earn virtually all their returns on new drugs before they go off patent and prices plummet amid generic competition. This also explains why drug makers advertise new products so heavily."
