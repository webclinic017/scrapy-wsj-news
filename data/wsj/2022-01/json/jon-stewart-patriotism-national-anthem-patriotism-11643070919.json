    "body": "Fay Vincent’s explanation of why people customarily stand for the national anthem at sporting events (“An Anthem Answer for Jon Stewart,” op-ed, Jan. 20) was duly patriotic. Mr. Stewart, however, was not necessarily “irreverent” in wondering how the custom arose. American patriotism is full of “weird rituals”—and we are free to disregard them while still loving our country. Mr. Stewart campaigns for 9/11 first responders. That’s a noble form of patriotism. One of the beauties of our country is that we can show it reverence in almost any way we see fit.<br />Nic Rowan"
