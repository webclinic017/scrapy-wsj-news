    "body": "Chevron  was off to a great start in 2022, but investors suddenly see its barrel as only half full.<br />The company started the year off with a bang, with its shares touching a record high on Thursday after it announced a 6% hike to its dividend, which is more generous than the 4% analysts had expected. Rival  Exxon  Mobil kept its payout unchanged on the same day but is expected to raise it later."
