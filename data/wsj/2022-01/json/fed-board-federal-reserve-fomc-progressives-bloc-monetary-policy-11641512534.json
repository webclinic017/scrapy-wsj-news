    "body": "Your editorial on FDIC independence (“The Warren-Biden Bank Heist,” Jan. 3) makes an important point about the Federal Reserve. The Biden administration’s three proposed Fed appointees would, together with the previously nominated vice chairman, constitute a majority of the Federal Reserve Board. This would give this progressive bloc greater power than at first appears over the conduct of U.S. monetary policy.<br />For many years, monetary policy has been committed largely to the Federal Open Market Committee, not the board. But this is much more a matter of practice than statutory or other law. In fact, the board, not the FOMC, has legal power over monetary tools that are much more powerful than those commanded by the FOMC, so that the Board’s use of these tools can overwhelm any actions of the committee."
