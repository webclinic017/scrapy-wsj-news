    "body": "Canada’s oil-sands companies are taking action to reduce emissions from their operations (“One of Dirtiest Oil Patches Is Pumping More Than Ever,” Page One, Jan. 14). The energy transition is a move to a more diversified energy mix, as the world strives to meet the growing demand for energy while lowering emissions. Oil and gas will play a key role in both parts of that equation. As a significant source of greenhouse gases, our industry must be a meaningful actor in reducing those emissions. And we are.<br />To advance realistic solutions,  Canadian Natural Resources ,   Cenovus Energy ,  ConocoPhillips Canada, Imperial, MEG Energy and Suncor Energy, which operate facilities representing about 95% of Canada’s oil-sands production, formed the Oil Sands Pathways to Net Zero initiative. The industry has already reduced its emissions intensity by 34% since 1990, and this alliance will accelerate emissions reduction toward the ambition of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050."
