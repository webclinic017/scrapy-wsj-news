    "body": "After three decades, defense may not be a buyer’s market anymore.<br />This week, the Federal Trade Commission filed an antitrust lawsuit that seeks to block  Lockheed Martin ’s  $4.4 billion plans to acquire rocket maker Aerojet Rocketdyne, arguing that it “would allow the combined firm to use its control of Aerojet to harm Lockheed’s rivals in ways that would substantially lessen competition in multiple markets for products critical to the national defense.”"
