    "body": "President Biden’s Georgia speech last week on voting and elections was riddled with too many falsehoods to count. But one of his claims deserves closer scrutiny. The President said the “endgame” of Republican state legislatures is “to turn the will of the voters into a mere suggestion—something states can respect or ignore.” Assuring listeners that this is “not hyperbole,” he added, “your vote won’t matter. They’ll just decide what they want and then do it.”<br />Senate Democrats may vote Wednesday on a proposal that would nationalize election law. The assertion that GOP legislatures are preparing to overturn a future presidential vote in their state is a major justification. Let’s examine this claim to see if it’s true."
