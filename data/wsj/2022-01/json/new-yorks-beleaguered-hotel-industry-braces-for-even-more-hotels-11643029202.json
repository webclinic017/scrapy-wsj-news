    "body": "New York City hotels are still suffering from the effects of the pandemic, but that hasn’t slowed the flow of new properties expected to open this year and in the years to come.<br />Fifty-three hotels are scheduled to add an estimated 9,000 rooms to the New York City market in 2022, according to September figures from research firm Lodging Econometrics. That puts the city on track for the nation’s second-highest growth rate, just behind Austin, Texas, for hotel rooms added among the 50 biggest markets."
