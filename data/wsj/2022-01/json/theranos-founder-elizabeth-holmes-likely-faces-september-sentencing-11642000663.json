    "body": "Prosecutors have proposed a mid-September sentencing date for Theranos Inc. founder Elizabeth Holmes and said they donâ€™t plan to pursue three charges that deadlocked the jury at her criminal-fraud trial.<br />The disclosures in a Tuesday evening court filing come just over a week after a jury convicted Ms. Holmes of one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and three counts of wire fraud for intentionally deceiving investors about her now-defunct blood-testing startup. The jurors acquitted Ms. Holmes of four counts tied to Theranos patients and failed to reach a unanimous verdict on three others related to defrauding investors, leaving the government with the option of retrying the undecided counts."
