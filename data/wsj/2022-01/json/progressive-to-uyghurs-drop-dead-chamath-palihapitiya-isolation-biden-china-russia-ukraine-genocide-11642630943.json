    "body": "There are variations on the story about how to get a mule’s attention, but we should thank Golden State Warriors minority owner Chamath Palihapitiya for hitting all of us over the head with a 2-by-4. As he put it in a now-famous podcast: “Nobody cares about what’s happening to the Uyghurs, OK? You bring it up because you really care, and I think it’s nice that you really care. The rest of us don’t care.”<br />A mountain of high dudgeon has fallen on Mr. Palihapitiya, who looks sufficiently case-hardened not to lose sleep over it. But don’t get distracted. Push deeper into the interview, and this fellow from the NBA’s courtside seats says something that is at the center of the debate over America’s role in the world right now."
