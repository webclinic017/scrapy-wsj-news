    "body": "Secretary of State Antony Blinken is visiting Europe this week in a frantic effort to deter a Russian invasion of Ukraine, and we hope he succeeds. But the Administration is also signaling that an invasion is likely, and if so it’s worth explaining why deterrence will have failed.<br />The fault lies mainly with Vladimir Putin and his desire to restore Greater Russia. But this ambition has been known at least since his annexation of Crimea in 2014, so why has he moved again now? And why have Washington and Berlin failed to convince him that the costs of another invasion will exceed the benefits?"
