    "body": "AMONG THE many social media tributes that circulated after Joan Didion’s death last month was one featuring a photo of the writer seated at her typewriter, the ne plus ultra of stylish intellectualism in a black turtleneck. She posed in a similar garment for her 1989 Gap ad, and although the turtleneck did not make Didion’s famous packing list, it should have. It has the same spare, incisive form she demonstrated in both her prose and her dress.<br />More pragmatically, turtlenecks are cozy and reassuringly classic. Perhaps that’s why so many brands—from Givenchy, Paco Rabanne and Prada to Officine Générale, Alex Mill and Ann Mashburn—enthusiastically endorsed high-neck knitwear this season, rendering it in both strong hues and allover patterns. It’s a trend that’s been building since Raf Simons put brightly colored turtlenecks on the Calvin Klein runway in 2017."
