    "body": "IN DISNEY’S 1950 animated film “Cinderella,” the eponymous heroine is consigned to sleeping in an ostensibly punishing attic room. Despite dreary stone walls and rough-hewn floorboards, however, her little single bed tucked under the beams of a right-there roof looks kind of cozy. “Low ceilings create immediate intimacy,” said Brett Phillips, of High Street Homes in Fort Worth, Texas. And though some might find slanted ceilings a decorating challenge, Mr. Phillips roots for them. They “need to be embraced and celebrated, especially in second-story spaces where roof lines create interesting angles,” he said. Here, six ways to rescue the random spaces under a home’s eaves from disrepute.<br />“A great way to take advantage of the space under a slanted roof is to incorporate a low piece of furniture, such as a desk,” said Marco Angelucci, design director at Marguerite Rodgers Interior Design in Philadelphia. “It allows you to use the space without banging your head.” In a room designed during the early days of the pandemic for grown children escaping New York City, Carey Karlan of Darien, Conn., design firm Last Detail slipped a work surface beneath the eaves. “This compact little desk is just enough for a computer,” she said."
