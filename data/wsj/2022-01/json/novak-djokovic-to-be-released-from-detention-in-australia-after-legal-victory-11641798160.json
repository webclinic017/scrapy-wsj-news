    "body": "A judge ordered that tennis player Novak Djokovic be released from detention, overturning the Australian government’s cancellation of his visa and potentially clearing the way for him to compete at the Australian Open.<br />Judge Anthony Kelly overturned last week’s decision by authorities, who canceled Djokovic’s visa on the grounds that he wasn’t exempt from rules requiring travelers to Australia to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19. The judge ordered the government to pay costs and for the No.1 men’s tennis player to be released from detention, with his passport and personal effects returned to him."
