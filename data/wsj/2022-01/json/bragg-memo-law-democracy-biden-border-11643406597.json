    "body": "Peter Reinharz is right to blast Alvin Bragg, the new Manhattan district attorney, for refusing to enforce the laws enacted by the legislature, and for making up his own laws instead (“Alvin Bragg’s Threat to Democracy,” Jan. 25). That’s not democracy. But Mr. Bragg is hardly alone.<br />The U.S. has a thick body of immigration law adopted by Congress. The Constitution says the president’s job is to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” But President Biden doesn’t like the immigration laws, so he has decided to take care that they not be faithfully executed."
