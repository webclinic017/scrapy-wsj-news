    "body": "As I walk down the corridors of a major New Jersey medical center, I cannot help but notice rows of medical professionals transfixed to computer screens (“The Doctor’s Office Becomes an Assembly Line” by Devorah Goldman, op-ed, Dec. 30). The data consumes their attention. While patients wait, the professionals robotically configure information into medical “notes.”<br />This is a laborious process. I often thank God that I paid attention in Ms. McGillicutty’s high-school typing class, not knowing how important it would be at this stage in my career."
