    "body": "‘The true point of view in the history of this nation,” wrote historian Frederick Jackson Turner in 1893, “is not the Atlantic coast, it is the Great West.”<br />Turner proposed that it was America’s generations-long encounter with the wilderness of its Western borderlands that forged American institutions and the special capacities in its citizens for resourcefulness and self-reliance. He also believed that the American frontier had ceased to exist by 1890, but only because he assigned insufficient importance to Alaska. The disjunct territory that did not become a state until 1959 continues to exist in our imagination—and in truth—as a place where Old World versions of wilderness survive, where Americans can still court danger, take the measure of their resourcefulness and perhaps reinvent themselves. Millions of us at home can watch this in process on such reality TV shows as “The Deadliest Catch.”"
