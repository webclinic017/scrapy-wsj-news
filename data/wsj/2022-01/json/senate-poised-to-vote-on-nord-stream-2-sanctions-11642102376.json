    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Senate is set to vote Thursday on a bill sponsored by Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) that would impose sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG, the company behind a pipeline built to deliver Russian natural gas to Germany.<br />The Cruz bill would initiate sanctions no later than 15 days after enactment of the law. The measure, scheduled for a vote under an agreement reached with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), will require 60 votes to pass. It then would need to pass the House before heading to President Biden’s desk for his signature."
