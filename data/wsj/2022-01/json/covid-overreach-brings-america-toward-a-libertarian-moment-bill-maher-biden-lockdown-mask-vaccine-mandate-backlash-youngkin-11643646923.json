    "body": "The rising fear among American conservatives since the early days of the Covid pandemic has been that the nation would emerge from the crisis significantly less free.<br />It’s an unease rooted in the historic reality of one of the most powerful laws of human governance: the ratchet effect.

Government agencies built to administer some specific function are absorbed into the permanent bureaucracy."
