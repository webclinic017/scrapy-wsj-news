    "body": "BOGOTA, Colombia—A former Colombian soldier who Haitian authorities said was involved in the July assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse has become the first suspect in the case to be arrested by U.S. officials and brought before an American court.<br />Mario Antonio Palacios was flown by U.S. officials to Miami and appeared Tuesday in a federal courtroom, the Justice Department said. He faces charges of conspiracy to commit murder or kidnapping outside the U.S. and providing material support resulting in death. American authorities have jurisdiction because Haitian investigators assert the plot was partly planned and financed in Florida, with a Miami-area security company providing weapons and training to the alleged assassins."
