    "body": "While many Americans celebrated the holidays with their families in the final week of 2021, law enforcement kept working. Tragically, four officers didn’t make it home to their loved ones that week. They were murdered while doing their job keeping others safe.<br />Baltimore Police Officer Keona Holley, ambushed while alone in her car, died on Christmas Eve. Five days later in Illinois, Wayne County Sheriff’s Deputy Sean Riley was killed during a call for assistance. On Dec. 30, also in Illinois, Bradley Police Department Sgt. Marlene Rittmanic was shot while attempting to locate the owner of dogs left in a car. And on New Year’s Eve, Cleveland Police Officer Shane Bartek was killed in an attempted carjacking."
