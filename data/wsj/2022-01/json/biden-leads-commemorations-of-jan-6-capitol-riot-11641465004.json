    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden and congressional Democrats intend to mark the anniversary of the Jan. 6 riot with a somber day of remembrances at the Capitol, a year after supporters of then-President Donald Trump tried to block the certification of the election.<br />Mr. Biden intends to use his speech Thursday morning to note the historical significance of the anniversary, honor members of law enforcement who protected the Capitol and discuss steps to strengthen the nation’s democracy and institutions, said White House press secretary Jen Psaki. She said Mr. Biden will also address what she called the “singular responsibility President Trump has for the chaos and carnage that we saw,” citing his false claims of election fraud and actions the day of the attack."
