    "body": "Robert Durst, the troubled millionaire scion of an influential New York real-estate dynasty who was convicted of the murder of his longtime friend and was a suspect in another killing and the disappearance of his wife, died Monday at the age of 78.<br />For years, Mr. Durst had dodged suspicions of his involvement in the 1982 disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen McCormack Durst, and the 2000 killing of his friend Susan Berman. Though he had many run-ins with law enforcement, he had managed to fend off most of the serious charges against him."
