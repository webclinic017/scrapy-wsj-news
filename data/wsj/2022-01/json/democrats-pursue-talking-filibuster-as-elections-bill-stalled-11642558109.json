    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) set in motion a plan to require senators to speak on the floor if they want to block Democrats’ elections bill, a proposed change to the chamber’s filibuster rule intended as a last-ditch effort to pass the legislation.<br />Facing Republican opposition to the elections bill, Democrats have been weighing various proposed changes to the current Senate procedures, which require 60 votes for most legislation to proceed to a final vote. While all 50 members of the Democratic caucus have united behind the party’s elections overhaul, Sens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia have said they would reject partisan attempts to weaken the filibuster, dooming the effort."
