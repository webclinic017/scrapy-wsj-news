    "body": "A second New York police officer died of his wounds Tuesday after being ambushed on Friday night while responding to a call about a domestic dispute. Wilbert Mora, who was 27 years old, died after being shot in the head by an assailant who kicked open the door of a bedroom and opened fire on officers.<br />Another officer, 22-year-old Jason Rivera, died earlier from the same shooting. Rivera had joined the NYPD only months earlier out of what he said was a desire to improve ties between the police and the community. Two other New York officers were shot in separate incidents last week."
