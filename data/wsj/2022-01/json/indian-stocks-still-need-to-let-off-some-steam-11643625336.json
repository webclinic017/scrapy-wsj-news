    "body": "Indian stock markets broke all sorts of records in 2021. Frothy valuations and economic headwinds may cap further upside this year.<br />Expectations of sooner and faster rate increases from the Fed have sparked an early 2022 selloff in India, though so far the market has proved more resilient than in the U.S. The MSCI India has fallen 2.4% so far this year, compared with a 7% drop for the S&P 500."
