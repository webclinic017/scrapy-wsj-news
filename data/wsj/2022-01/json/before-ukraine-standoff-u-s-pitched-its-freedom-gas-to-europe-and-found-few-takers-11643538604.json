    "body": "U.S. officials tried to persuade Europe for years to buy American natural gas as a bulwark against Russia, with the Trump administration dubbing it “molecules of freedom.” But most countries stuck with the cheaper Russian supplies, with some expressing environmental concern about the fruits of U.S. fracking.<br />Now, as Europe confronts the possibility of a serious supply squeeze amid Russian hostilities toward Ukraine, the U.S. is trying to help Europe secure emergency gas supplies. But there is only so much the Biden administration can do: Most American gas has been sold to other customers, and Europe has limited facilities to import more."
