    "body": "Markets are sending a hard message to decode: While the fate of the world’s big economies is ultimately intertwined, their monetary policies will become quite different in 2022.<br />Since last September, yields on two-year Treasury bills and gilts—a proxy for where investors see interest rates being set—have risen to 0.8% and 0.7% from 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively, whereas yields in the eurozone and Japan remain pegged at record lows. This reflects the big rift opening up between the major central banks of the English-speaking world and the rest: The Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada want to respond to a surge in inflation, whereas the European Central Bank and the  Bank of Japan  still attribute it to temporary supply-chain bottlenecks."
