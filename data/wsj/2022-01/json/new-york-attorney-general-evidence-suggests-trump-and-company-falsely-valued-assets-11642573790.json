    "body": "The New York attorney general’s office said late Tuesday it uncovered a swath of evidence that former President Donald Trump and his company falsely valued assets to obtain loans, insurance coverage and tax deductions.<br />The findings came in court papers asking a judge to order Mr. Trump and two of his adult children, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr., to comply with civil subpoenas for its fraud investigation. Attorney General Letitia James’s office said while it hadn’t reached a conclusion about whether to take legal action, the grounds for the investigation were “self evident.”"
