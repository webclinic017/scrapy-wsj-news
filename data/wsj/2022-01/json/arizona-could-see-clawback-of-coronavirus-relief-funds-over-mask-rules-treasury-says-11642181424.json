    "body": "Arizona could see a clawback of federal coronavirus relief funds if the state doesn’t redesign two educational programs that the federal government says undermine the use of masks in schools, the Treasury Department said in a letter to the state Friday.<br />The Arizona programs erode efforts to stop the spread of Covid-19 and are therefore ineligible for federal coronavirus relief funds, the Treasury Department added."
