    "body": "Beijing has developed a reputation for blocking imports from countries it wants to punish. Australian wine became a target last year. Now China is punching back at Lithuania, which recently allowed Taiwan to open a representative office in Vilnius. But here’s the new twist: China is holding up not only Lithuanian imports, but all imports that include Lithuanian parts. The effects are rippling across Europe.<br />In 2020 Lithuania exported goods worth $350 million to China—an increase over previous years but peanuts in overall trade. Lithuania has long imported far more from China than vice versa; last year, about four times as much. So Lithuania’s government perhaps calculated that the country’s economy could handle whatever retaliation China inflicted for the gesture to Taiwan."
