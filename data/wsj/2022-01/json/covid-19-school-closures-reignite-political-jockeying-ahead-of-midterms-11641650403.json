    "body": "WASHINGTON—Republicans are testing out new lines of attack related to the new year’s school shutdowns, with party officials seeing Democrats’ record on Covid-19 education policy giving them an opening to build their war chests and sway voters in the midterms.<br />School closures and frustrations with remote learning played a significant role in Republicans’ victory last year in Virginia, when Glenn Youngkin won the governor’s mansion. Now, following a wave of temporary closures nationwide due to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, Republicans are targeting what they say is Democrats’ mismanagement of the outbreak."
