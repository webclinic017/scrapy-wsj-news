    "body": "The last sentence of Bjorn Lomborg’s op-ed “Today’s Soaring Energy Prices Are Only the Beginning” (Jan. 6) reads: “Only when green energy is cheaper than fossil fuel—or at least close to cheaper—will voters be willing to switch.” For a year or so I agreed and have kept watching for the cost of green energy to decrease while expecting the cost of fossil-fuel energy to remain roughly the same. But when I saw Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm laugh wholeheartedly when asked what she would do about the rising cost of gasoline, I realized my mistake. The Biden administration’s strategy is to raise the cost of fossil fuels high enough to justify the high cost of green energy. Thus the cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline and drilling rights on public lands.<br />Vern Zander"
