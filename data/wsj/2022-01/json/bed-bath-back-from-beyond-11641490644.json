    "body": "Bed Bath & Beyond ’s  shares rode the meme-stock surge to the moon a year ago. Today its shares have come back closer to Earth—an altitude where it is easier for not only short sellers but its management to breathe.<br />The retailer on Thursday had mostly bad news to deliver. It reported that same-store sales in the quarter ended Nov. 27 fell 7% compared with a year earlier—much more than the 0.9% decline analysts had been expecting. Some of that had to do with problems beyond its control. Without supply-chain snags, the company said, it would have sold $100 million more. But some are of management’s own making: The company last year got rid of too many printed circulars, which it later realized were an important traffic driver. Even after deciding to correct the issue, paper-supply problems last quarter meant the retailer couldn’t print those out as quickly as it wanted to."
