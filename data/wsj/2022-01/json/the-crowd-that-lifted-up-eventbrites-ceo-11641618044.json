    "body": "Attending a Star Trek convention while working on a documentary series showed Julia Hartz the power of live events. The experience became the inspiration for ticketing company  Eventbrite ,  which she started with her fiancé and another founder. Their goal was to make gatherings easier for event organizers and attendees.<br />Now that model is being tested by a pandemic that continues to shut down live events around the world as new variants of Covid-19 surface. Eventbrite, which laid off nearly half its staff in April 2020, survived the early days of Covid-19 by helping organizers shift to virtual gatherings and manage everything from ticket sales to the marketing of their events. Eventbrite’s revenue rose 144% to $53.4 million in the third quarter, compared with the year-earlier period. Paid ticket volume increased by 107% to 19.1 million paid tickets. Its stock is up roughly 200% from its lows in April 2020."
