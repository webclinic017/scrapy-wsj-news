    "body": "A New Year’s Eve salvo from Beijing accusing  Walmart Inc.  of “stupidity and shortsightedness” has driven home a stark challenge for Western businesses in one of their most promising markets: As governments ratchet up accusations of human-rights violations in China, officials there are pressuring foreign companies to take China’s side.<br />Western businesses have suffered through various waves of geopolitical headwinds as they have sought to do business in the world’s most populous country.
