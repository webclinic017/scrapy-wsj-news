    "body": "FARM-TO-TABLE COOKING and outstanding produce are what customers expect at Anne Quatrano’s Atlanta restaurants, no matter the season. “We grow carrots in the winter, and they’re really perfect,” said the chef of her farm 45 miles outside the city. Ms. Quatrano’s final Slow Food Fast recipe, a layered and satisfying salad, showcases the vegetable two ways, roasted and raw.<br />Tossed in oil and roasted until caramelized and yielding, the cooked carrots provide a meaty backbone to this vegetarian dish. Ms. Quatrano shaves a few more carrots paper-thin and plunges them into cold water to crisp and curl into a snappy garnish. Toppings of toasted pistachios and golden raisins plumped in white wine lend texture as well as contrasting flavors. And the aromatic cumin-seed dressing ties the dish together, providing an invigorating antidote to the deepest winter doldrums."
