    "body": "For much of his literary life, Charles Lamb was a jack of all trades and a master of none. He wrote poetry like his Romantic contemporaries and good friends Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth though his verse was of a lesser caliber. He produced a sentimental novel that underwhelmed and a farcical play that bombed. He collaborated with his sister, Mary, on a children’s adaptation of Shakespeare’s work, and compiled critical commentaries on the bard’s fellow Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists. Only when Lamb turned his hand to the familiar essay at the age of 45 did he find his true métier. Adopting the nom de plume of “Elia” but drawing upon his own thoughts and deeds, Lamb captivated readers with a winning blend of insight, intimacy, wordplay, allusion and what Walter Pater called “hints of the innermost reason in things.”<br />However, Lamb wrote while battling personal demons. He was self-conscious about his stutter and drank heavily to overcome it and to endure frequent “sad depression of spirits.” That depression took shape, and took hold, following a life-defining family catastrophe. Lamb, then aged 22, gave a stark summary of it in a letter to Coleridge: “My poor dear dearest sister in a fit of insanity has been the death of her own mother. I was at hand only time enough to snatch the knife out of her grasp.”"
