    "body": "On June 23, 2018, 12 boys—members of the Wild Boars soccer team—and an assistant coach wandered into the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in northern Thailand. The boys ranged in age from 11 to 16, the coach was 25. The official monsoon season hadn’t begun; if it had, the cave would have been closed. But rain began falling—lots of it—and when the young adventurers tried to turn back, they discovered that they were trapped, with more than half a mile of rock above them and 21/2 miles of flooding cave behind them.<br />Three days later, Vernon Unsworth, a British spelunker on site outside the cave, persuaded government officials that if the boys were to be saved, consummate cave divers would be needed. The next day, Rick Stanton and two colleagues landed in Thailand."
