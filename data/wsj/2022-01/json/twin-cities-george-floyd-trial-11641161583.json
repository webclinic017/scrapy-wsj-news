    "body": "The Twin Cities are preparing for another big trial stemming from the killing of George Floyd, as three former Minneapolis police officers face federal charges later this month that they violated Mr. Floyd’s civil rights during his May 2020 arrest.<br />This time, former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin won’t be on trial, making it easier for the other three former officers to lay the blame on him for Mr. Floyd’s death, say lawyers not involved in the case."
