    "body": "Credit Suisse ’s  New Year’s resolution for a steady, boring 2022 has already fallen by the wayside.<br />António Horta-Osório’s surprise resignation late Sunday from the helm of the beleaguered lender raises the suspicion that his departure might be due to more than the chairman’s stated coronavirus infractions. The outsider had promised to deliver a much-needed shake-up of the Swiss bank’s culture. His exit puts pressure on successor Axel Lehmann to show that the transformation will continue."
