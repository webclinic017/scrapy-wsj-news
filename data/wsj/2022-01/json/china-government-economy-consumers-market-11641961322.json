    "body": "“China Misses Target in 2020 Trade Deal” (U.S. News, Jan. 3) provides an informative account of how China failed to keep its side of the bargain of the 2020 U.S.-China trade deal to buy U.S. goods. Who is the buyer called “China”—private firms or the Chinese government? The Chinese government runs China like a giant corporation. The line between the state and private companies is fuzzy at best. The way the Chinese government treats companies such as Didi and Alibaba is more like managing departments of China, Inc.<br />Ironically, while we complain to the Chinese government that it interferes with the economy too much, the 2020 trade deal legitimized the interference by the Chinese government and strengthened its power."
