    "body": "General Motors and  Ford  are veering into online used-car sellers’ lane. How quickly can they overtake them?<br />GM announced earlier this month that it will launch a new website, CarBravo, which will help its U.S.-based dealers market and sell all types of used cars online, not just its models. That would place it in direct competition with online used-car retailers such as Carvana, Vroom,  Shift Technologies  and even  CarMax ,  which has both a bricks-and-mortar and e-commerce presence. Ford started inching into that territory last year when it launched a platform, Ford Blue Advantage, that also lets dealers list and sell used cars, though it is limited to its own-brand certified vehicles."
