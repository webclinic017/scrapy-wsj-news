    "body": "China Evergrande Group secured investor backing to delay making payments on a $708 million onshore bond denominated in Chinese yuan, avoiding what could have been its first public default in the country’s domestic bond market.<br />The move highlights how big Chinese borrowers such as Evergrande can effectively operate in two distinct financial worlds, with creditors onshore sometimes taking a different approach from their international peers, and with markets in China somewhat shielded from defaults offshore."
