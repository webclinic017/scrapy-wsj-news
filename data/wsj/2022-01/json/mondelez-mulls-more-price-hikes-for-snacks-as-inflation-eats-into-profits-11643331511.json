    "body": "Mondelez International Inc.  said higher prices for its snacks weren’t enough to make up for the rising ingredient and transportation costs it faced in the latest quarter.<br />The global food giant said it would likely raise prices further around the world this year, while also negotiating with its suppliers and hedging to reduce costs. Mondelez’s profitability continues to get squeezed as issues like commodity inflation, trucking shortages and labor challenges persist, especially in the U.S., executives said."
