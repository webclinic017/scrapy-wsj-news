    "body": "Transcripts released by the Federal Reserve on Friday revealed the extent of officials’ 2016 debate over how fast to move up interest rates after lifting them from near zero at the end of the previous year.<br />Much of the discussion turned on geopolitical developments—first as a slowdown in China and in commodity prices threatened to cool down the U.S. manufacturing sector and later after voters in the U.K. voted in favor of leaving the European Union."
