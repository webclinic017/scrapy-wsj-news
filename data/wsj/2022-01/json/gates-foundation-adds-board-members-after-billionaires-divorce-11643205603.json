    "body": "The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation named four new members to its board of trustees, adding outsiders to the board for the first time in the charity’s history after the divorce of its co-founders Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates.<br />The changes are part of efforts to add more governance and independence to one of the world’s largest philanthropies, which has an endowment of more than $50 billion. Mr. Gates and Ms. French Gates remained co-chairs after their marital split, but the foundation had no other trustees after Bill Gates Sr. died in 2020 and Warren Buffett, another major donor, resigned in June 2021."
