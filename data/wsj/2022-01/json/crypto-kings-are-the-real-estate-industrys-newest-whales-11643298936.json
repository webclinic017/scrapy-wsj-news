    "body": "When real-estate agent Ryan Serhant received an offer last fall for one of his listings, a roughly $25 million Downtown Manhattan apartment, he was pleased but dubious.<br />The buyer, to whom he gave a property tour, seemed nice but didn’t fit the profile of Mr. Serhant’s typical high rollers who often come from Wall Street or prominent families. This buyer said he was self-employed, but when Mr. Serhant googled him, he found nothing that explained his wealth."
