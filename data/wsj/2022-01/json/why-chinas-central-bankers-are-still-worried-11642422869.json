    "body": "After a tumultuous 2021 marked by near-disaster in the property sector and a widening crackdown on other previously fast-growing industries such as internet technology, China’s economy demonstrated a bit of spark Monday. New figures showed fourth-quarter growth at 4% year over year, slower than the third quarter’s 4.9% but still well above the 3.3% consensus estimate among economists polled by FactSet.<br />Still, policy makers clearly don’t see much to celebrate: On Monday the People’s Bank of China also announced a 0.1 percentage point cut to two of its key policy rates."
