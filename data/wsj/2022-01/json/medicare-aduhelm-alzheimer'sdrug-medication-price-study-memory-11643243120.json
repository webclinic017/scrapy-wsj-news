    "body": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposes to restrict Medicare payment for a class of novel, promising Alzheimer’s treatments, the first of which is Biogen’s Aduhelm (costing $28,200 annually per patient). Your editorial “The Alzheimer’s Death Panel” (Jan. 24) lays bare the unvarnished reason for this: “Progressives want to expand Medicare benefits to win senior votes, then ration treatments to contain government spending.”<br />Those who know the ravages that Alzheimer’s inflicts on a loved one can attest that it is a cruel disease, and that staving off its worsening for even a few years would be virtually priceless. It is maddening that such a blessing will likely be denied us at the same time our healthcare bureaucracy is wasting so much on others who improperly receive services (“Build Back Better? Fix Medicaid First,” Review & Outlook, Jan. 24)."
