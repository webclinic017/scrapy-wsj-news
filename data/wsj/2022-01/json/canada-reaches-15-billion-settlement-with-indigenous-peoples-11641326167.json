    "body": "OTTAWAâ€”Canada said Tuesday it had reached a tentative agreement with indigenous advocates and communities to pay roughly $15 billion in compensation to indigenous children placed in a child-welfare system that a quasi-judicial body ruled violated human rights.<br />The development caps a nearly 16-year legal battle between advocates for indigenous children and the Canadian government. It represents one of the largest financial awards a developed nation has said it would pay members of its indigenous community."
