    "body": "The minimum wage in Portland, Maine, spiked to $19.50 from $13 on Jan. 1—more than five bucks higher than in the progressive paradise of Portland, Oregon. The City Council reversed the hike last week after an epiphany that the increase comes at an economic cost.<br />In November 2020 residents of the Forest City voted in favor of a ballot referendum to increase the minimum wage in stages to $15 by 2024. The referendum also stipulated that if Portland were under an emergency proclamation, a hazard-pay multiplier would take affect that’s 1.5 times the minimum wage. The City Council failed to lift the state of emergency before New Year’s Day, so up the minimum wage skyrocketed on Jan. 1."
