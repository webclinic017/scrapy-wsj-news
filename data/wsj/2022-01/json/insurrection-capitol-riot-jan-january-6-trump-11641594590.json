    "body": "Regarding Jeffrey Shapiro’s op-ed “Stop Calling Jan. 6 an ‘Insurrection’” (Jan. 6): I was first made aware of the word “insurrection” as a teenager in 1965, when it was used widely in media to characterize the Watts riot in Los Angeles. No one argued with the word choice. It was true.<br />Years later, as a newspaper editor, I knew differences in denotation and connotation. A word in reasonable and general use might not apply in legal technicality. We might describe a backbenchers’ move on House leadership as an “insurgency.” In editorials, I sometimes decried taxation as “theft.”"
