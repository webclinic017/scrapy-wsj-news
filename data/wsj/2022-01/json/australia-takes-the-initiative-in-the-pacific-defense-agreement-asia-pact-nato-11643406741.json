    "body": "America’s alliance structure in the Pacific has traditionally operated like a bicycle wheel. Washington is the hub, and ties with Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Thailand are spokes that keep the whole thing spinning. The key is that U.S. relationships in Asia, unlike Europe, tend to be bilateral—country to country, instead of herded through institutions like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or the European Union.<br />Some U.S. partners in the Pacific worry about this structure’s long-term stability. It is being squeezed by China from the outside, and there are anxieties over Washington’s long-term reliability as the center. That leaves two options for U.S. allies: connect other spokes to reinforce the structure, or ditch Washington and find a different hub of support."
