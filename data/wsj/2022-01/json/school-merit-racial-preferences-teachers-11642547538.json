    "body": "In “An Ugly Game of Race Preferences” (Main Street, Jan. 11), William McGurn lays out the perniciousness of school policies that have the effect—and purpose—of reducing Asian-American student numbers in elite programs. I can tell you that I often heard unkind mutterings about Asian-Americans during school awards ceremonies when those children took a majority of awards. It was saddening and chilling.<br />Making high achievement available to all, regardless of class and race, is nonetheless a vitally important goal. Public school can be a door to life-altering success. My husband, for example, began as a minor “hood” in the public schools of Bridgeport, Conn., in the 1960s, with teachers disinterested in his failure or success. That is, until one teacher early in high school saw that he was intelligent and could write well. From there, he went to college and graduate school. In between, he taught high school and held students to high standards, which often began with their first-ever bad grades, followed by success and intellectual growth. Forty years later, he still gets letters from students thanking him for challenging them."
