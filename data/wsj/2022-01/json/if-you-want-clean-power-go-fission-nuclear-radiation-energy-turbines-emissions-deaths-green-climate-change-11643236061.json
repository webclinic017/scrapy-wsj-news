    "body": "Fission is in fashion as drawbacks of intermittent wind and solar power emerge. Fifty-seven nuclear plants are under construction around the world. The European Union is greenlighting new financing, while Boris Johnson in the U.K. and Emmanuel Macron in France have endorsed new domestic construction. China promises 10 new plants a year.<br />As the new reactors come into operation, some accidents may leak radioactive materials, but the radiation won’t harm people. We need to educate the public so that mass hysteria doesn’t stop progress toward reliable, economical CO2-free energy."
