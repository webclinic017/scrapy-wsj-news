    "body": "Investors are pumping more capital into continuation funds, a relatively new portfolio-management tool that allows private-equity firms to buy more time and money to manage assets they backed through older funds. However, short decision-making time frames and potential misalignment of interests with the fund’s managers make backing these vehicles tricky for investors.<br />“Our model historically has been built on alignment of incentives, and GP-led vehicles, continuation vehicles, break that model a little bit,” said Thomas Albright, investment manager, private equity, at Teacher Retirement System of Texas. He spoke Wednesday during a virtual emerging manager conference hosted annually by the Texas pension system and its peer, the Employees Retirement System of Texas."
