    "body": "Police in Torrance, Calif., have finished investigating a man who was found passed out in his car last summer with stolen mail, including more than 300 ballots for the recall vote on Gov. Gavin Newsom. The good news: There’s no evidence that the man “intended to engage in any type of election fraud.”<br />Eduardo Mena, 34, was involved, rather, in “schemes to commit bank fraud and identity theft,” Torrance police said Monday. “The investigators were able to determine the election ballots were among numerous items of mail stolen from a United States Postal Service vehicle.”"
