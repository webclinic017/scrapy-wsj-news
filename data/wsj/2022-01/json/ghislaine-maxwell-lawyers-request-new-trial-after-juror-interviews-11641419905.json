    "body": "Lawyers representing convicted sex-trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell asked a federal judge Wednesday to grant the British socialite a new trial after a juror told media outlets that sharing his experiences as a sexual-abuse victim influenced deliberations.<br />In a separate letter to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan, federal prosecutors said that while jurors were free to talk to the media after the verdict, the jurorâ€™s statements merited an inquiry."
