    "body": "Covid-19â€™s Omicron variant is causing new business disruption, but the good news is that continuing jobless claims have fallen to the lowest since March 7. Companies are having a hard time finding workers, and a new National Bureau of Economic Research working paper shows the job market would have bounced back even faster without expanded unemployment benefits.<br />Congress at the outset of the pandemic increased the generosity of unemployment benefits while extending eligibility to many Americans who previously would not have qualified, including independent contractors and part-time workers. The maximum duration of benefits was extended to as many as 99 weeks from the typical 26."
