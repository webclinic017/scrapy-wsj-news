    "body": "Washington<br />In “Fashioning an Empire: Safavid Textiles From the Museum of Islamic Art, Doha” at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Asian Art (comprising the Freer Gallery of Art and the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery), lively abstract florals float against the red ground of a carpet; naturalistic roses inspired by Mughal models from India shimmer in a silver-threaded brocade; and on a velvet panel two women set out for a hunt, one holding a still-hooded falcon, the other a snarling dog at the end of a leash. These are some of the late 16th- through early 18th-century textiles touted in the subtitle, but these 12 pieces did not travel from Qatar by themselves. Three full-size portraits accompanied them to Washington, where they are joined by about a dozen 16th- and 17th-century folio-size paintings from the trove in the galleries’ storage."
