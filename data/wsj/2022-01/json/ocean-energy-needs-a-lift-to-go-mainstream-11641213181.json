    "body": "Oceans contain energy that is both renewable and predictable—an appealing combination given the challenges posed by fluctuating wind and solar power. But the technologies for harvesting marine energy will need a boost if they are to go mainstream.<br />Water is more than 800 times as dense as air, so it carries a lot of energy when moving. Waves off the U.S. coasts have theoretical energy potential equivalent to two-thirds of the nation’s 2020 electricity generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Better still, water is complementary to wind and sunshine, today’s established but volatile sources of renewable energy. Tides are known decades ahead of time, while waves are persistent, storing up wind energy and arriving for days after the winds stop."
