Fashion chains would like the trend to stick, although this will be challenging as inflation bites.<br />On Friday, Swedish fast-fashion company  H&M  Hennes & Mauritz reported much better profits for the quarter through November than analysts were expecting. The company’s top line has now recovered to pre-pandemic levels and operating margins are higher. Management also announced ambitious plans to double sales by 2030 and grow margins above 10%. H&M’s shares were up 5% in morning trading."
