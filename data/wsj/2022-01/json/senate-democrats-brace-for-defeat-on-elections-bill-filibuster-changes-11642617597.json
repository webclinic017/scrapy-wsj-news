    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Senate was expected to vote on a rewrite of the country’s election rules, with Republicans prepared to block the bill and Democrats ready to respond with an ill-fated attempt to muscle through the package with a simple majority by changing the Senate’s procedures.<br />The Senate will tackle two big issues Wednesday evening: rules regarding when, where and how citizens can cast their ballots, and Senate procedures requiring 60 votes to pass most legislation. In the 50-50 Senate, Democrats have been unable to pass multiple rounds of their elections agenda because of GOP opposition. They also stand short of the 50 votes needed to change Senate procedures because of opposition from Sens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, twin realities that leave Democratic lawmakers and President Biden bracing for defeat."
