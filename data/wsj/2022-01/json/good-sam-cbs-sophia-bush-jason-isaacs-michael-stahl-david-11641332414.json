    "body": "Anyone scheduled for open-heart surgery at Lakeshore Sentinel Hospital—the setting of the new medical drama “Good Sam”—might want to run for his life. The place certainly has good doctors—cutting-edge, one might say. But the competition between its two most prominent physicians is so distractingly messy you could spread it with a tongue depressor.<br />The two also happen to be father and daughter, a surprise sprung early enough in episode 1 not to be a spoiler, but late enough for the principal characters to be established: Sam Griffith (Sophia Bush), supervisor of the surgical residents, is talented, even-tempered, caring and so shockingly traditional she’s ready to take a job elsewhere when her doctor boyfriend, Caleb (Michael Stahl-David), doesn’t propose. Her father? Rob Griffith (Jason Isaacs) is arrogant, domineering, a surgical “genius” who engenders both fear and loathing in his underlings. After being shot by a nut with a gun during a hospital emergency (Sam’s “Dad?!” is our tipoff that they’re related), he spends six months in a coma, during which time Sam is made head of surgery. Everyone’s happy—except, when he comes to, Dad."
