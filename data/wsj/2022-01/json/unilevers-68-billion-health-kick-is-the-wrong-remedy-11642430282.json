    "body": "Unilever ’s  bid for  GlaxoSmithKline ’s  majority-owned consumer-health business is a bold move from a management team sometimes criticized for being timid. But the deal is risky and should stay on the shelf.<br />The maker of Hellmann’s mayonnaise and other consumer staples on Saturday confirmed a report in the London-based Sunday Times that it made an offer for the joint venture between Glaxo and  Pfizer  that makes Centrum vitamins and Panadol painkillers. Unilever shares fell 7% in early European trading Monday despite a second statement from the company giving strategic context for the move."
