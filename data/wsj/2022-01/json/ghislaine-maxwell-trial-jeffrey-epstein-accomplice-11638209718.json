    "body": "Ghislaine Maxwell is a British socialite who was found guilty on five of six criminal counts in her sex-trafficking case, capping federal prosecutors’ push to bring the longtime confidante of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein to justice.<br />“Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set,” then-Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said in a July 2020 indictment. “She pretended to be a woman they could trust.”"
