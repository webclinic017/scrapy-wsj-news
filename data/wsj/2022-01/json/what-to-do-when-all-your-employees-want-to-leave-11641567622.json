    "body": "We all got an earful about the “Great Resignation” in 2021, as Americans left their jobs in growing numbers. This past week, the Labor Department reported that the U.S. set a new quitting record in November. According to a PwC study last year, a full 65% of employees were in search of a new job. That’s great for employees who may feel newly empowered to start an entrepreneurial venture or use the tight job market to negotiate a raise or promotion. But what if you’re the boss?<br />For obvious reasons, it’s problematic when your employees start leaving, or hinting or threatening that they might. Staff turnover is pricey—it costs an estimated one-half to two times an employee’s annual salary to replace her. Plus, it’s disruptive to client relationships and the morale of staffers left behind."
