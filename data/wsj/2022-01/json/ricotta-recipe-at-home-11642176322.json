    "body": "I’VE BEEN teaching cooking classes for about a decade, and one of my favorites is cheesemaking. In the most basic class we start with the simplest cheese, ricotta. Seeing it come together for the first time invariably inspires an audible reaction, often an “Oh, wow.” Liquid turns into solid, right in front of your eyes. It’s science, but it sure does look like magic.<br />Cheesemaking starts with curdling milk, and that can be achieved through a couple of different means. Many of the world’s greatest cheeses—Camemberts, fetas, cheddars—rely on bacteria to metabolize the milk and create acids, which lower the pH to the point where curds separate from whey. We’ve all seen this happen by mistake, in our refrigerators, when the milk goes bad. You could absolutely strain that curd out and make cheese with it, but the bacteria in your fridge probably don’t produce delicious aromatic compounds the way certain more desirable bacteria do."
