    "body": "Still liking  AT&T ’s  plan to spin off its giant Warner Media acquisition especially in view of  Netflix ’s  big selloff Friday? The press was over the moon about the pending dismemberment when it was announced eight months ago. It involved big dollars and a big climb-down by Ma Bell’s management, which had recently fought the Justice Department to put the two together.<br />But if you’ve been waiting for a sign from the stock market that the separation would actually be value creating, you’re still waiting. AT&T and the nominal acquirer, Discovery Communications (of which AT&T shareholders will end up owning 70%) have exhibited largely flat stock prices since the still-dragging deal was announced last year."
