    "body": "Terry Teachout, who adorned these pages as our drama critic and cultural columnist for nearly 20 years, died early Thursday at age 65.<br />An artistic savant of wide erudition, Terry had written reviews and other pieces for our books and arts pages as long ago as 1987. He took on the role of weekly theater critic with gusto in March 2003, and he made his reviews a favorite destination for readers as the weekend approached."
