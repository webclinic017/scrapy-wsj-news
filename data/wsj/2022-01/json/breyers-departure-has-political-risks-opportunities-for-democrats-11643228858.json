    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Democrats hope to move quickly to confirm a Black woman to replace retiring Justice Stephen Breyer on the Supreme Court, as both parties use the vote to rally support ahead of November’s midterm elections at a time when President Biden’s political fortunes have faltered.<br />Confirmation of the next justice would require the support of at least 50 senators in the evenly split chamber, with Vice President Kamala Harris poised to cast a tie-breaking vote—meaning Democrats could approve the nominee with no Republican help, as long as they remain united. High-court nominations have become increasingly contentious in recent years, with all three of Republican former President Donald Trump’s picks being confirmed by slim margins with little or no Democratic support."
