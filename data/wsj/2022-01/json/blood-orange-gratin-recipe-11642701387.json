    "body": "THE WORD GRATIN might conjure visions of creamy potatoes Dauphinoise or perhaps the molten-cheesy top on a crock of onion soup. But in France, a gratin is as likely to be a light fruit dessert as it is something savory. In the former case, slices of fruit are placed in the bottom of a shallow, ovenproof dish, thinly blanketed with sabayon (a light custard) and broiled for just a few minutes. Most any fruit can be used, from citrus to mango in winter and, in the summer, berries, stone fruit and figs.<br />This remarkably quick and easy dessert comes together in just a few swift, elegant strokes. The blast of high heat from the broiler intensifies and concentrates the flavor of fruit, fast; a small amount of sabayon gives it a luxurious, silken quality. In summer it’s a splendid alternative to fruit salad, and in winter it offers comfort and warmth and a bit of consoling indulgence."
