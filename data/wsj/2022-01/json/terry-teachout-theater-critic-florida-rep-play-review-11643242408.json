    "body": "So many lesser critics go to the theater to criticize, to show how smart they are, to promote themselves and not the play or its theater. Terry Teachout was the opposite (“Terry Teachout,” Review & Outlook, Jan. 14). He loved the theater. Loved actors. Watching him watch a play was a joy. He always sat on the edge of his seat, leaning into the stage in excitement and anticipation.<br />In 2007 I discovered there was a major New York critic traveling the country, fully supported by the Journal, to write about what was going on in the regions. Working at the Florida Repertory Theatre in Ft. Myers, I instructed staff to send him press releases on every show we produced, hoping he would bestow us with a visit and review. I had scheduled for 2008-09 a difficult Irish play “Dancing at Lughnasa,” because it was perfect for our ensemble. After the economy tanked, my managing director begged me to replace it with a silly comedy that would make more money. How glad I am that I refused."
