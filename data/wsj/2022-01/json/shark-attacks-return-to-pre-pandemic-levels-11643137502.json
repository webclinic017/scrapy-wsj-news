    "body": "Shark attacks increased across the globe last year compared with 2020, returning to levels recorded before the Covid-19 pandemic, a new report said.<br />There were 73 unprovoked shark bites world-wide in 2021 from a variety of species, according to a report from the Florida Museum of Natural History’s International Shark Attack File released Monday. That figure is close to the five-year average of 71 attacks globally each year. But it is higher than the 52 unprovoked bites reported in 2020, when the pandemic limited people’s movement."
