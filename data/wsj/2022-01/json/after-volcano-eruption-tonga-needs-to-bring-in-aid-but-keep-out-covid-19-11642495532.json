    "body": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand—In the aftermath of a volcanic eruption and tsunami that ravaged parts of Tonga, governments and humanitarian agencies are wrestling with how to get aid safely into one of the last Covid-free places on Earth.<br />Tonga, a Pacific nation comprising around 170 islands, was showered with toxic ash from Saturday’s eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano that threatens to poison water sources. Tsunami waves at least a meter high smashed into buildings and swept away cars. The undersea cable that connects the archipelago with the rest of the world via Fiji appears to be badly damaged."
