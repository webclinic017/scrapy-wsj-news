    "body": "WASHINGTON—The select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol has asked House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy to cooperate voluntarily with their probe, seeking information about his conversations with former President Donald Trump before, during and after the riot.<br />In a letter to Mr. McCarthy dated Wednesday, the committee’s chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D., Miss.), acknowledged the sensitivity of such a request to the top-ranking House Republican, saying the committee has tremendous respect for the prerogatives of Congress and members’ privacy. “At the same time, we have a solemn responsibility to investigate fully the facts and circumstances of these events,” he said."
