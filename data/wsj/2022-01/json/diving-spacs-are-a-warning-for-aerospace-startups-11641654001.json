    "body": "For speculative aerospace startups, taking off gets harder when market winds suddenly turn against you.<br />Last year consolidated special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, as the preferred way to list firms that make no money but promise cosmic returns. Aerospace has fully embraced them, starting with British billionaire Richard Branson’s space-tourism venture,  Virgin Galactic ,  in 2019 and then through a raft of small-satellite launchers—such as  Rocket Lab  and  Astra Space —and makers of electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing vehicles, or eVTOL—like  Joby Aviation ,   Archer Aviation ,   Vertical Aerospace  and Lilium Air Mobility."
