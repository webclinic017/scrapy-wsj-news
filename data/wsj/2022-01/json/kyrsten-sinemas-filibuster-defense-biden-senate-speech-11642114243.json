    "body": "President Biden said in a speech Tuesday in Georgia that unless the Senate passes his party-line legislation overturning election laws in most states, American democracy is as good as dead. Less than 48 hours later on the Senate floor, Arizona Democrat Kyrsten Sinema ended the suspense as to whether the President will get his way.<br />According to the reasoning Mr. Biden laid out Tuesday, Ms. Sinema’s opposition to breaking the filibuster to pass his agenda must reflect an indifference to self-government in the U.S.—or even Jim Crow and Confederate sympathies on the part of the Arizona Democrat. Yet as Ms. Sinema calmly explained, she is refusing to go along with the President’s bullying precisely because of her democratic convictions."
