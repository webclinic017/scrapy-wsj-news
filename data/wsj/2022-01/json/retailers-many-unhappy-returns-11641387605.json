    "body": "As the holiday glow wears off and consumers return to their normal routines, they will start sobering up to the reality of those ill-fitting pants bought hastily at a holiday sale or that gifted necklace they will probably never wear. They won’t be the only ones who are disappointed: Longer return windows and higher parcel costs mean returns could end up taking a bigger bite out of retailers this year.<br />Products and gifts valued at $112 billion to $114 billion could be returned to U.S. retailers after the holiday season, up from $100 billion in 2020 and $95 billion in 2019, according to an estimate from B-Stock Solutions, an online liquidation platform that allows retailers such as  Best Buy  and  Walmart  to sell returned or excess inventory to other, typically smaller retailers.  United Parcel Service  expects to handle more than 60 million return packages from Nov. 14 through Jan. 22, a 10% increase from the previous year."
