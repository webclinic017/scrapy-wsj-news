    "body": "Democrats this week are renewing their calls to cap prescription drug prices, and Sen. Ron Wyden has found a scapegoat in the cause. The Senate Finance Chairman is casting an ordinary tax decision as an outrage in need of a government crackdown.<br />The target is  Bristol Myers Squibb ,  maker of blood-clot and cancer drugs. Sen. Wyden last week accused the drug maker of skirting federal tax rules in 2012 by transferring patents to an Ireland-based affiliate. In a letter to Bristol Myers CEO Giovanni Caforio, the Senator said the Internal Revenue Service restricts “the shifting of income and profits within partnerships in order to avoid paying U.S. taxes.”"
