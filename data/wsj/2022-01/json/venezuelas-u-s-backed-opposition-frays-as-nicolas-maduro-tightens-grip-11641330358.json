    "body": "In 2019, a coalition of Venezuelan political parties backed by the U.S. had grand ambitions to overthrow President Nicolás Maduro and cut off his financing by seizing some $20 billion in foreign assets from his regime and managing them on their own.<br />Mr. Maduro’s grip on power has since tightened. Efforts to restore democracy have stalled. And the political alliance headed by Juan Guaidó—whom Washington supports as Venezuela’s legitimate president—is fraying amid disputes over how much power he should wield and alleged mismanagement of the state-owned companies the opposition controls."
