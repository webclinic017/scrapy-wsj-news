    "body": "The U.S. called for a meeting of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the standoff over Ukraine, seeking to apply international pressure on Russia to negotiate its concerns about European security among diplomats rather than on the battlefield.<br />The meeting would be a rare opportunity for Washington and its allies to discuss the actions of another permanent Security Council member—Russia—on the world stage. Set for Monday, the meeting would occur just one day before Moscow takes over the rotating presidency of the council."
