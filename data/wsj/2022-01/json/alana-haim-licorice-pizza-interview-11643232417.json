    "body": "“I’VE HAD THE CRAZIEST year of my life,” said actor and musician Alana Haim. With daily routines complicated by shutdowns and the like, this statement might ring true for many Americans, but Ms. Haim, 30, also saw her stardom explode overnight.<br />Over the last decade, Haim—the rock band she and her older sisters, Este and Danielle, formed in 2007—has steadily grown more popular. Their 2022 tour, set to begin in April, includes stops at their biggest venues yet, including Madison Square Garden in New York and the Hollywood Bowl in their home state of California."
