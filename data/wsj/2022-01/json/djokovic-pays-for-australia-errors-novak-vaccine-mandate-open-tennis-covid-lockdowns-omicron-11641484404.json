    "body": "Australian tennis player Nick Kyrgios is notorious for on-court meltdowns. His government seems to be following his example. On Wednesday, Australia’s border security detained the world’s top tennis player, Novak Djokovic, for eight hours, then ordered him to leave the country. He won’t be able to compete in the Australian Open unless he wins his appeal.<br />“Mr. Djokovic failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements to Australia,” Health Minister Greg Hunt said. “It’s a matter for him if he wishes to appeal that, but if a visa is canceled somebody will have to leave the country.” With apologies to John McEnroe, you cannot be serious."
