    "body": "HONG KONG—Macau unveiled legislation in full outlining tighter government control over casino operators and restrictions on VIP junket rooms, the biggest overhaul of China’s gambling hub since the former monopoly was opened up two decades ago.<br />The draft law states that its aim is to ensure casino operations in the former Portuguese colony align with China’s national-security needs, are compatible with efforts to tackle illegal cross-border capital flows and money laundering, and deter criminal influences."
