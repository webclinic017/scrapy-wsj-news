    "body": "Over the past two generations, the share of Americans with four-year college degrees has more than doubled, and a new class of well-educated upper-middle-income professionals has emerged as a potent social and political force.<br />By and large, members of this new class have risen higher through education and mastered its rules. They do well on standardized tests, they get good grades, and they forge relationships with professors and other mentors that serve them well throughout their careers. Although some have taken advantage of family connections (through “legacy admissions” to universities, for example), many owe their advancement to their talents and skills. They insist they have achieved their position through their own efforts."
