    "body": "Authorities in Hong Kong sanctioned a Chinese businessman over the 2014 listing of a chemicals company that had claimed about $1 billion in nonexistent sales, closing a chapter in a saga that has already led to punishments for big U.S. and European banks.<br />A Hong Kong tribunal said Wei Xuan, executive director at Tianhe Chemicals Group Ltd., should be barred from managing or sitting on the boards of listed companies for four years. It also ordered Mr. Wei and Jinzhou-based Tianhe to pay costs related to the proceedings, without specifying amounts."
