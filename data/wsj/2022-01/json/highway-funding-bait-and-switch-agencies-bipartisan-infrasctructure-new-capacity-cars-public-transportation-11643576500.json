    "body": "If you hoped President Biden’s infrastructure spending might bring a smoother drive to an area near you, it’s worth reading the latest fine print. Before funds are disbursed, bureaucrats are attaching strings that make it far more difficult to build new highways.<br />The restrictions come from a memo last month from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).

Deputy Administrator Stephanie Pollack advised staff on the types of projects they should give the red light."
