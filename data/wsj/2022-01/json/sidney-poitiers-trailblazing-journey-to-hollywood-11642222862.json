Seventy-five years old and still strikingly handsome, Sidney Poitier couldn’t have stood out more if he’d had a spotlight on him. I must have been 100 feet away, but I felt those little electric currents firing in the tips of my fingers, the internal buzz created only by the charisma of the kind of movie star who takes your breath away—the kind who stands, I can say without hyperbole, as the most important American movie actor of the 20th century.<br />For what it’s worth, I hardly ever approach celebrities. But this time was different. At the Academy Awards earlier that year, Poitier had been given an honorary Oscar “in recognition of his remarkable accomplishments as an artist and as a human being.” In his speech, Poitier, who died this month at 94, remarked on the uncharted path he had followed since arriving in Hollywood in 1949 as a 22-year-old Bahamian-American, brand new to the movies."
