    "body": "‘Who We Are: A Chronicle of Racism in America” is a provocative and valuable documentary, playing in select theaters, by Emily Kunstler and Sarah Kunstler. The first part of its title could be taken as a response, or corrective, to what we hear so often in TV coverage of racist crimes—someone saying, ritually, “This is not who we are.” But the film’s content isn’t ritual at all. It’s one man’s answer, eloquent and heartfelt, to the challenge of reframing our discussion of a subject that has us numb from repetition.<br />The man at the center of the chronicle, Jeffery Robinson, is a former ACLU Deputy Legal Director. At the outset the camera finds him onstage in 2018 at New York’s Town Hall Theater, giving a presentation that combines calm instruction and passionate advocacy with a compelling kind of showmanship fueled by the impulse to show—to demonstrate, with the help of videos, photos and historical documents, how and why racism, as he puts it, “is our shared history.”"
