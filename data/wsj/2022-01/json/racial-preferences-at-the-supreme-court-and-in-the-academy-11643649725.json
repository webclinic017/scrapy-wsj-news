    "body": "Your editorial “Race, Harvard and the Supreme Court” (Jan. 25) argues that “the progressive zeal for divvying up people by race, ethnicity and sexuality has increased.” But it is slavery, Jim Crow, lynching, the Ku Klux Klan and its followers (Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, QAnon), and persistent structural racism (exclusionary zoning, reliance on property taxes to pay for K-12 public education) that has long divvied up people by race and continues to do so today. Progressives wish they had such power.<br />The editorial concludes with the right’s favorite Supreme Court quote: “The way to stop discriminating on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.” Is it really that difficult to distinguish between practices that have had the intent and effect of perpetuating racial inequality (school segregation, legacy admissions, voter suppression) and those aimed at ameliorating levels and costs of racial inequality?"
