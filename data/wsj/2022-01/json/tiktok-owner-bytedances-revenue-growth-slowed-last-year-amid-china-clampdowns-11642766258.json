    "body": "Revenue at Chinese social-media giant ByteDance Ltd. rose by about 70% last year to roughly $58 billion, slowing from a year earlier, people familiar with the matter said, as Beijing tightened scrutiny over its internet sector and as an economic slowdown hit advertising sales.<br />The Beijing-based maker of popular short-video platform TikTok and its mainland Chinese counterpart, Douyin, briefed senior staff members about its financial performance this week, the people said. In 2020, ByteDance’s revenue more than doubled from the previous year to $34.3 billion, The Wall Street Journal has reported."
