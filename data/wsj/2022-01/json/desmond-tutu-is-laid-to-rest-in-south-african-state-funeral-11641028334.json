    "body": "CAPE TOWN, South Africa—The state funeral of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a hero of South Africa’s struggle against apartheid, began on Saturday in the cathedral where he spent decades preaching against racial injustice.<br />Mourners gathered under stormy Cape Town skies as the service began in St. George’s Cathedral, the oldest Anglican church in Southern Africa, which Mr. Tutu mobilized into a refuge for resistance against white-minority rule during the 1980s. Attendees in the cathedral—including Mr. Tutu’s widow, Leah, and four children—were restricted to 100 because of Covid-19 regulations. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, a former union leader and antiapartheid campaigner, was set to deliver the eulogy from the same pulpit where Mr. Tutu preached against the apartheid government and led his parishioners in protest songs instead of hymns."
