    "body": "If America were a corporation, investors and regulators would consider its corporate governance a mess. CEO Joe Biden can’t seem to agree with the board—Congress—on strategy, priorities, the budget, or pretty much anything else. Some directors are going rogue, ignoring board meetings and the normal chain of command.<br />Worse, these governance issues are paralyzing U.S.A. Inc. when it can least afford it. China and Russia are challenging the global leadership of America and its allies. The Covid-19 pandemic is a major health and economic drain, and the fiscal outlook is grim."
