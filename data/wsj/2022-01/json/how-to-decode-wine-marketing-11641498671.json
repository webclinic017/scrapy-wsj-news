    "body": "WALK INTO MOST any wine shop and you’ll likely see signs touting a “hidden gem” or a “staff pick” or perhaps even an “unsung hero” or two. If you’re wondering what these terms really mean, you’re not alone.<br />Is a staff pick a wine a staffer actually loves or one the wine merchant needs to move? Similarly, is a hidden gem truly special but little known, or simply a bottle that has sat on the shelf a little too long? I recently queried retailers about why they attach certain phrases to certain bottles. In the process I found some wines that truly lived up to their buzzwords."
