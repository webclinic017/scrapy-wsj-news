    "body": "Consumer price inflation in December, at 7%, was last this high in the summer of 1982. That’s about all the two periods have in common.<br />Today, the inflation rate is on the rise. Back then, it was falling. It had peaked at 14.8% in 1980, while Jimmy Carter was still president and the Iranian revolution had pushed up oil prices. Core inflation that year reached 13.6%."
