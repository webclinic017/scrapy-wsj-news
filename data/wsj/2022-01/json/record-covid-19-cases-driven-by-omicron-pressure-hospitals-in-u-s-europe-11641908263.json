    "body": "U.S. officials on Tuesday ordered 600,000 doses of Covid-19 treatment sotrovimab, the only monoclonal antibody therapy thought to work against the Omicron variant, as a record number of cases puts hospitals under increasing pressure in parts of the U.S. and Europe.<br />Sotrovimab, made by  GlaxoSmithKline  PLC and  Vir Biotechnology Inc.,  is now the only Covid-19 monoclonal antibody available for patients in the U.S. The government paused distribution of two other treatments, made by  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.  and  Eli Lilly  & Co. in late December, after early laboratory tests suggested they lost effectiveness against the new strain."
