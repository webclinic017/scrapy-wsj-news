    "body": "Bruce W. Arden endured part of his childhood on a farm in Kansas with no indoor plumbing or electricity. At age 17, in 1944, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and learned the elements of electronics as a radar technician.<br />“Luck ushered me into digital computing,” he wrote in a memoir offered to friends and family. After World War II, at the Allison division of  General Motors ,  he helped design parts for jet engines and graduated from slide rules to an IBM card-programmed calculator. “My responsibility was to make it work,” he recalled."
