    "body": "Peggy Noonan’s column “Biden’s Georgia Speech Is a Break Point,” (Declarations, Jan. 15) hit the nail on the head. Since President Biden’s over-the-top rant grouping his opponents with white supremacists, I have rarely read so many condemnations from such a wide spectrum of writers.<br />Most of these articles bemoaned Mr. Biden’s words and questioned why he chose to speak so divisively. Missing was the fact that, for this most closely scripted and controlled president, his words were not his alone but crafted by his closest staff advisers. The Atlanta speech was not only the inchoate bluster of our president. It represents the clearly defined beliefs of his entire administration."
