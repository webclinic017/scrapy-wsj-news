    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Democrats put the party’s marquee economic package on ice, shifting their attention to passing elections legislation as they consider how to overhaul the roughly $2 trillion education, healthcare and climate bill.<br />Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), whose support Democrats need to advance the bill in the 50-50 Senate, last month said he was opposed to the package, scuttling Democrats’ hopes of quickly passing the centerpiece of President Biden’s legislative agenda. Mr. Manchin is pushing for the party to restructure the bill, which would provide funding for initiatives including healthcare subsidies, child care subsidies and housing."
