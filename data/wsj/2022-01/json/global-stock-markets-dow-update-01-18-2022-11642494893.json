    "body": "U.S. stock futures fell, led by large technology stocks, as government bond yields rose to a two-year high, a sign that investors are rotating out of stocks that do well in a low-interest-rate environment.<br />Futures for the S&P 500 fell 1% Tuesday, after U.S. markets were shut Monday for a public holiday. Contracts for the tech-focused Nasdaq-100 declined 1.6% and futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7%."
