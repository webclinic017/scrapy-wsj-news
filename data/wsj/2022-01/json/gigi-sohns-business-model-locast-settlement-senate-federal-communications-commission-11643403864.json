    "body": "Does an independent agency nominee who has deceived Senators about her business conflicts deserve to be confirmed? That’s a question Senators need to ask about Federal Communications Commission nominee Gigi Sohn.<br />Ms. Sohn is as progressive as they come on media and broadband competition. But as troubling is her involvement in Locast, an app that captured and retransmitted local broadcast signals over the internet without broadcasters’ permission. Viewers could stream the content for free, though it accepted donations."
