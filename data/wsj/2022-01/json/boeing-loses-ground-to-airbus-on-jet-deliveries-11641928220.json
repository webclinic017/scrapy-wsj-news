    "body": "Boeing Co.  sold more aircraft than  Airbus SE  last year but delivered half as many passenger jets, in a sign of the changing landscape facing the worldâ€™s two dominant plane makers.<br />Chicago-based Boeing said Tuesday that it won orders for 909 planes in 2021 but delivered only around 280 passenger jets, falling behind Airbus and relying more on its cargo jets and military versions of commercial planes. Including cancellations, Boeing secured 535 net new orders, including older deals for 56 planes that it now considers more likely to be fulfilled."
