    "body": "Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Federal Aviation Administrator Stephen Dickson are rightly defending U.S. leadership in aviation safety—and protecting passengers and shippers—by insisting that telecom companies ensure safety before launching new 5G service that could damage pilots’ ability to navigate airliners (“Buttigieg’s FAA and 5G Mid-Air Collision,” Review & Outlook, Jan. 4).<br />New AT&T and Verizon service could create interference known to cause the radio altimeters—which tell pilots how far planes are above the ground—to provide faulty data or even stop working. For years, pilots urged the wireless industry to collaborate to ensure safety, but until the Transportation Department and FAA intervened, the industry dismissed our concerns."
