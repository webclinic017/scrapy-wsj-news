    "body": "Getting the U.S. Senate to do something isn’t easy. How would you convince skeptical colleagues and outline thorny issues for voters?

Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), appeared on NBC’s “Meet The Press” Sunday to excoriate every Republican and two Democratic senators for not caving in to the 48 Democrats backing the Build Back Better Act’s cornucopia of new welfare benefits and seeking to pass a federal takeover of elections by killing the filibuster."
