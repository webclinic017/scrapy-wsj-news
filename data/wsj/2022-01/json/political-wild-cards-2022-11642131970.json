    "body": "The story line for national politics in 2022 seems simple and straightforward: Democrats are in trouble, and Republicans are poised to take back control of one or both houses of Congress in the year’s midterm elections.<br />Given both historical trends and current conditions, that forecast certainly seems on target. Yet as with most things political these days, the year ahead isn’t likely to be quite that simple and straightforward. The 2022 political deck is full of wild cards, which make prognostication risky."
