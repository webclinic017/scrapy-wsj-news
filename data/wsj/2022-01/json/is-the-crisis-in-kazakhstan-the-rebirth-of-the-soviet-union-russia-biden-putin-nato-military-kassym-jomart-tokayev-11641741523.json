    "body": "Some commentators saw Russia’s deployment of “peacekeeping forces” to Kazakhstan last week as a setback for Vladimir Putin. It showed his weakness, they said. His troop deployments near Ukraine’s border were failing, and new popular uprisings could topple autocrats in other former Soviet republics, complicating the Russian president’s strategic calculations.<br />The unspoken corollary to this theorizing is that the last thing America or Europe should do is take provocative action regarding Ukraine or other countries caught in the gray zone between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s eastern borders and Russia’s western ones. Kazakhstan is a Kremlin problem where “America has no real leverage,” as Politico put this instant conventional wisdom. Predictably, the State Department’s first reaction to the Kazakh crisis was moral equivalency, calling “for restraint by both the authorities and protestors.”"
