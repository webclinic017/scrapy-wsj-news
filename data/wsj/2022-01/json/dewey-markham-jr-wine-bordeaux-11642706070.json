    "body": "JUST OVER TWO months ago the world of wine lost a gifted writer and educator whose remarkable contribution to wine scholarship reflects a quietly remarkable life.<br />Dewey Markham, Jr., who died in November at the age of 68, wrote a seminal book on the wines of Bordeaux. “1855: A History of the Bordeaux Classification” provides an exhaustive account of the unique ranking system for Bordeaux wines—from first-growths, or premières crus, down to fifth-growths, or cinquièmes crus—instituted in the reign of Napoleon III and the standard by which Bordeaux wines are understood (and priced) to this day. Published in 1997, this work is all the more impressive for the fact that Mr. Markham was a Black American writing about an insular, overwhelmingly white, hugely hierarchical wine region in France."
