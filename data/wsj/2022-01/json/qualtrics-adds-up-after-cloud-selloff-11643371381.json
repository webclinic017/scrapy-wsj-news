    "body": "Qualtrics ’s  first year on the public market has been a rough one. But it has made the cloud software company into a relative rarity—an affordable, high-growth name.<br />The Utah-based company, which provides subscription-based software to businesses looking to evaluate their customers’ experiences, went public a year ago Friday. That was a couple of years later than its original plan; German software giant SAP bought Qualtrics for $8 billion in cash just days ahead of its first proposed listing in November 2018. But Qualtrics was doing well enough—especially relative to SAP’s much larger but still largely traditional enterprise software business—that SAP decided to spin the newest member of its family back out."
