    "body": "One of New Yorkâ€™s oldest law firms, Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, has anointed new leadership for the first time in more than a decade, teaming litigator Robert Giuffra and corporate lawyer Scott Miller together as co-chairs.<br />The two take over at a time when many large law firms are thriving, even as some sectors of the economy struggle to recover from the continuing pandemic. Sullivan & Cromwell, whose clients include  AT&T Inc.,   Volkswagen AG  and JPMorgan Chase & Co., saw revenue and profits rise by a double-digit percentage in 2021, its new leaders said. In 2020, the firm brought in $1.56 billion in revenue and its partners earned $5.2 million on average, according to the American Lawyer magazine."
