    "body": "President Biden has made democracy and its virtues one of his main presidential themes, and much of what he said Thursday on the anniversary of Jan. 6 is worth applauding. Yet as a defense of democracy his speech failed, and it’s worth noting why.<br />One welcome theme was Mr. Biden’s assertion that “our democracy held” last Jan. 6 and is more durable than critics aver. We agree, and this puts him at odds with the current fashion on the intellectual and media left that a coup d’etat is already underway for 2024."
