    "body": "Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards posthumously pardoned Homer Plessy Wednesday, more than 100 years after the Black shoemaker and activist was arrested for refusing to leave a whites-only train car, a move that led to the Supreme Court ruling that upheld segregation laws.<br />The Louisiana Board of Pardons approved the pardon application for Mr. Plessy in November of last year, thereby leaving the decision of whether to pardon him up to Mr. Edwards. Mr. Plessy died in 1925."
