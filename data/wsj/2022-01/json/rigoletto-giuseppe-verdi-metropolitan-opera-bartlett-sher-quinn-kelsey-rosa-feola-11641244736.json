    "body": "New York<br />Amid the Omicron-related cascade of theater, dance and concert cancellations, the Metropolitan Opera’s New Year’s Eve show—Bartlett Sher’s new production of Verdi’s “Rigoletto”—went on as planned. Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, gave a brief curtain speech thanking the company and the audience, and noting that thanks to the Met’s stringent health measures (“You have no idea,” he said wryly), none of its performances have been canceled. It was not business as usual, of course. The gala dinner was called off, there were some empty seats, and Mr. Gelb urged the audience members to keep their masks on. Still, there was plenty of festive attire and selfie-snapping, and Quinn Kelsey, who sang the title role, took his bows in a 2022 tiara as confetti dropped on the audience. Just when we started taking live performance for granted again, we were reminded how easily it could go away."
