    "body": "The rollout of a new 5G wireless internet service has gotten hung up because of a tussle about risk to cockpit equipment in airplanes. Following delays,  Verizon  Communications Inc. and  AT&T Inc.  plan to start offering the service this month.<br />Telecom companies were supposed to roll out a new, faster wireless internet service in early December. The plan hit some hurdles after air-safety regulators prepared to impose disruptive flight restrictions, because they said the 5G service could potentially pose risks to cockpit equipment in aircraft. The telecom industry disputes the service would create any hazards."
