    "body": "The U.S. Justice Department charged four Belarusian government officials with aircraft piracy, alleging they conspired to fabricate a bomb threat to divert a Ryanair passenger jet last year to arrest a dissident journalist.<br />In an indictment filed Thursday in New York, the Belarusian officials were also accused of conspiring to cover up the fake bomb plot after the Boeing 737 made an emergency landing in May in the nationâ€™s capital, Minsk. The aircraft, carrying 126 passengers, was en route from Athens to Vilnius, Lithuania, when Belarusian air-traffic controllers told the pilots of the purported threat, according to the indictment."
