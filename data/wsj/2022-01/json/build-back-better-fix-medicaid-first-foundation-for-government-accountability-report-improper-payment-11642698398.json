    "body": "While Democrats are dreaming up ways to enlarge the welfare state, here’s a bracing statistic about America’s existing safety net: “The national improper payment rate for Medicaid is nearly 22 percent.” That quote is taken from a report this week by the Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA), and it gets worse from there.<br />That national figure is for 2021, and most of it, about 80%, is due to eligibility errors. To fill in the picture, the FGA sent records requests to individual states, whose errors are sampled on a rotating cycle. The group’s report cites figures for about a dozen. Top of the list was Ohio, with a bad payment rate of 44.3%. Illinois, a usual suspect, came in at 37.3%. Missouri was 31.7% and North Dakota 28.3%. Those are 2019 figures, the latest available for each state."
