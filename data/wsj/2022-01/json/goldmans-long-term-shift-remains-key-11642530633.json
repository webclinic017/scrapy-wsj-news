    "body": "Wall Street trading may not be quite the bonanza it was in 2021, but investors don’t have to cash in their bets quite yet.<br />Shares of  Goldman Sachs  are tumbling sharply on Tuesday, down about 8%. Investors might be worried about trading desks, with the bank’s reported fourth-quarter trading net revenue down 7% versus the prior year. But it was hardly in free fall. Fixed income, currency and commodities trading revenue was down just 1% versus the fourth quarter 2020 at Goldman, smaller than declines at peers that have reported thus far."
