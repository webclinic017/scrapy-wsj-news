    "body": "There’s no presumption of innocence in W. Kamau Bell’s “We Need to Talk About Cosby,” which isn’t surprising: Bill Cosby’s 2018 conviction on three counts of aggravated indecent assault was overturned last year by a ruling that didn’t refute the evidence against him, only the prosecutor’s decision to use it. So while the comedian’s legal problems may have expired, so has his career.<br />Mr. Bell, a comedian and social critic, isn’t really interested in Mr. Cosby’s legal status, though: He’s interested in the man’s legacy. What he finds in his sometimes angry, often dismaying examination of the Cosby saga is a sense of outrage, betrayal and ultimately sadness, especially among the Black Americans he interviews; they wear, almost uniformly, the look of people who’ve been suckered. Mr. Cosby represented the best. If you believe his very believable accusers—who are given much time here—he really was among the worst. But the issue is ticklish: A lot of people, Mr. Bell says in introductory voiceover, were asked to participate in his four-part project. “A lot of people said no.”"
