    "body": "One thing they don’t tell you about working out in the metaverse: The exercise might be in virtual reality, but the sweat is real.<br />My first VR exercise was a boxing class that’s like “Dance Dance Revolution” for your hands. I punched color-coded targets zooming at my face and tilted to avoid swirling bars. After the session, I peeled the damp Meta Quest 2 (formerly known as Oculus) off my face—which is just as disgusting as it sounds. But there’s an upside: I couldn’t believe how hard my heart was pumping and how fast those 20 minutes flew by."
