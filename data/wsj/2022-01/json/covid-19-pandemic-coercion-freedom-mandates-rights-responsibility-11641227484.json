    "body": "Regarding David Henderson and Charles Hooper’s “Coercion Made the Pandemic Worse” (op-ed, Dec. 28): The coercive policies sprang from recommendations of experts whose focus is on public health, not on the individual patient. One of the pillars of medical ethics is that patient autonomy is sacrosanct. Diktats and coercion intended to serve the collective are antithetical to the long-held ethical foundation that informs the physician-patient relationship.<br />The authors do a great job demonstrating that allowing respect for autonomy has, at a minimum, equipoise with the authoritarian approach, if not superiority, when considering a range of measures of health and happiness."
