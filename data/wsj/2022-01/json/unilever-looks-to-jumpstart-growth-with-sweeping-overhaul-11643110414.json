    "body": "Unilever  PLC said it would restructure its operations into five stand-alone divisions, reshuffle top executives and cut jobs in a sweeping reorganization aimed at accelerating sales growth as the Dove soap owner girds itself against an activist investor and looks to quell shareholder dissatisfaction.<br />The company said Tuesday it would now run as five, category-focused divisions—beauty and well-being, personal care, home care, nutrition, and ice cream—rather than its three previous units of food and refreshments, beauty and personal care, and home care."
