    "body": "What’s with all the chaos conspiracies lately? In President Biden’s Atlanta speech earlier this month he said that on Jan. 6, 2021, “a dagger was literally held at the throat of American democracy.” Literally? Sorry about that, Chief. And of his opponents: “They want chaos to reign.” Last Memorial Day, Mr. Biden declared, “Democracy itself is in peril, here at home and around the world.” He constantly warns of “the existential threat” of climate change. Always chaos!<br />Why does that ring familiar? Ah yes, it reminds me of Kaos vs. Control from the TV series “Get Smart” which ran from 1965 to 1970. Mel Brooks and Buck Henry wrote the wisecracking spoof of James Bond—one episode was even named “Bronzefinger.” Maxwell Smart, Agent 86 played by Don Adams, kept a straight face delivering the best lines: “Missed it by that much.” “Sorry about that, Chief.” “I asked you not to tell me that.” My favorite? “And loving it!”"
