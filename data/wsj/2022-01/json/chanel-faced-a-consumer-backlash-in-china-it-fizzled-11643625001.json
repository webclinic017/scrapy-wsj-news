    "body": "When Chanel SA started marketing a new cosmetics range using red camellias this month, a Chinese competitor took offense and accused the French luxury brand of appropriating the Asian flower.<br />Sun Laichun, the founder of Shanghai-based cosmetics company Forest Cabin, vowed on the Chinese Twitter-like platform Weibo to do his “best to protect the beauty of Chinese women. Comrades-in-arms, together we will win this fight!” The post rapidly drew close to 100 million views, taking on the contours of what has become an increasingly common consumer backlash against a Western brand."
