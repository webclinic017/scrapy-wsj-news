    "body": "Apple Inc.  on Thursday is expected to post another record quarter, even as analysts see sales growing at their slowest pace in more than a year.<br />Jittery investors will be left parsing how much of that slowdown in revenue was because of lost sales due to supply chain problems—as previously warned by Apple executives—or waning interest in its latest iPhone lineup. Apple’s iPhone 13 models are very similar to versions introduced in October 2020, something that in the past has been linked to slower sales."
