    "body": "<br />Most of us had been led to believe that the blues is a very specific thing—that it’s supposed to be all about a guy standing in a barnyard, wailing away on an out-of-tune guitar about how some woman, or even the entire world, has done him wrong. Over the years, we’ve learned that the blues is much bigger than that. “Good Time Music: (Community Music, Vol. 2),” the new album by trumpeter, bandleader and composer Steven Bernstein, out Friday on Royal Potato Family, serves as a vivid illustration of how inclusive the impulse of the blues really is—how it transcends time (both musical and chronological) and interacts with other genres of music, often in surprising ways."
