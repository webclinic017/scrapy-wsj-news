    "body": "Unilever  PLC said it wants to significantly expand its footprint in health, beauty and hygiene, and plans to sell off slower-growing parts of its ice cream-to-soap consumer brands empire to fund major acquisitions.<br />The strategic update Monday came days after Unilever said it had approached  GlaxoSmithKline  PLC and  Pfizer Inc.  about buying their consumer-healthcare joint venture, GSK Consumer Healthcare. A successful acquisition of the business, which sells everything from Aquafresh toothpaste to Advil painkillers, would greatly expand Unileverâ€™s presence in categories such as oral care and vitamins."
