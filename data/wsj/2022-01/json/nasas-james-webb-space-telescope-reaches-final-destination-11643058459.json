    "body": "The James Webb Space Telescope arrived at its final destination about 1 million miles from Earth, marking the latest milestone for an instrument that astronomers expect to capture unprecedented views of far-flung galaxies and provide new insights into the origins of the universe.<br />The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said shortly after 2 p.m. ET Monday that the $10 billion, truck-size telescope had reached a spot in orbit around the sun where it will operate for the duration of its mission. At that location, known as Lagrange 2, or L2, the gravitational forces exerted by the sun and Earth balance out a spacecraft’s orbital motion, allowing it to remain in a fixed spot relative to our planet, according to the agency."
