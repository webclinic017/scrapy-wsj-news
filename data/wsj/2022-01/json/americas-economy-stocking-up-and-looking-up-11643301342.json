    "body": "America’s economy bounced back last quarter. How that happened is nearly as important as that it happened at all.<br />The Commerce Department on Thursday reported that, adjusted for inflation, gross domestic product grew at a 6.9% annual rate in the fourth quarter. That was significantly stronger than the third quarter’s 2.3% and ahead of the 5.5% economists had penciled in."
