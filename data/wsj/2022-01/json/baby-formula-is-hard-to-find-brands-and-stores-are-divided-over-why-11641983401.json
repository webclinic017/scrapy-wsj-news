    "body": "Baby formula has been hard to find in many parts of the U.S. for months, sending parents searching for Enfamil, Similac, Gerber and other brands.<br />Retailers and formula makers agree that out-of-stocks are a problem. They don’t agree on how severe it is and who is to blame. Chains like  Walmart Inc.  and  CVS Health Corp.  say the manufacturers are having supply issues; formula makers say retailers aren’t getting product to stores once it is delivered."
