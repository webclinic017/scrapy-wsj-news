    "body": "A California judge dismissed a lawsuit against rock group Nirvana from a man who alleged the band engaged in child pornography when a photo of him taken 30 years ago as a naked baby in a pool was used for the band’s “Nevermind” album.<br />The man, Spencer Elden, now 30, filed the lawsuit last year, asking the band’s members and the other defendants to each pay him $150,000 for taking the photo. Mr. Elden was 4 months old in 1991 when the photo was taken in a pool, according to court documents."
