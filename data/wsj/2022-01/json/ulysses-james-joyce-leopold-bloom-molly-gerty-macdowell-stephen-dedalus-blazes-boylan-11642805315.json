    "body": "<br />One hundred years ago, on Feb. 2, 1922, James Joyce’s 40th birthday, the half-blind author published “Ulysses,” the greatest and most innovative modern novel. The action takes place in Dublin, his native city, hour by hour, locale by locale, on a single day, June 16, 1904. The hero, Leopold Bloom, is an Irish-Jewish, middle-class advertising salesman, married to a Catholic professional singer, daughter of a soldier and born in Gibraltar. He is psychologically incapacitated by the death of his infant son, Rudy, and irrationally fears having another child who might also die. He no longer has sexual relations with his gorgeous, sensual wife, Molly, and restrains himself by sleeping head-to-toe in bed with her."
