    "body": "Something keeps happening in President Bidenâ€™s foreign policy: The White House announces that it wants to emphasize diplomacy on a particular issue, and American adversaries respond by advancing their interests with force.

The strike on Abu Dhabi was meant as retaliation after the U.A.E. stepped up its support for local forces fighting the Houthis. The attacks hit an oil facility, causing a spike in global oil prices."
