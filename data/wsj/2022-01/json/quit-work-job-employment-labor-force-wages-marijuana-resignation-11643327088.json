    "body": "Regarding Mene Ukueberuwa’s Weekend Interview with Nicholas Eberstadt (Jan. 22): What a fool I’ve been, following the unemployment rate as a barometer of the available workforce. I had no idea labor-force participation was only 61.9%, way down from the 1960s. I’ve boasted that Europe would never threaten the U.S. because Americans value work and its rewards far more. Now I learn the Europeans have passed us.<br />I retired at 78 and didn’t feel I was ready. I can’t imagine younger adults leaving the workforce. Life is short and travel is nice, but it’s no substitute for personal drive, achievement and contributing to society as well as one’s own mental health and sense of worth."
