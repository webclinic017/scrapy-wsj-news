    "body": "Chuck Schumer responds nearby to our recent editorial on his plans to ditch the Senate’s legislative filibuster, and we’re happy to give the Majority Leader his say. But since the Senator challenges us to explain our position on the 60-vote rule, allow us to make the distinctions he slides over.<br />He asks us to explain why we “supported Senate Republicans when they jammed though three Supreme Court justices” and the 2017 tax reform with fewer-than-60 vote majorities."
