    "body": "Regarding your editorial about President Biden’s Georgia speech (“Are You With Biden, or Jefferson Davis?” Jan. 12): John and I have been friends for more than 40 years. We were college roommates. Later, we got together to play golf a few times a year, took occasional hikes and walks—and we talked. More accurately, we disagreed and argued about almost every social and political issue of the day. Then we had lunch, played a round of golf or visited each other’s family.<br />Now, apparently, it’s time to end that 40-year friendship. Who knew that John favors autocracy over democracy? He never let on. Who knew he was Jefferson Davis, Bull Connor and Jim Crow, all rolled into one? I never noticed. Perhaps I can replace John with a new friend—one who thinks exactly like me."
