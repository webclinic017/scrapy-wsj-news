    "body": "Regarding William McGurn’s column “Sen. Biden’s Shrinking Presidency” (Main Street, Dec. 28): I was reminded of an old joke at a bank I once worked for, that our management training program consisted of having the new hire “sit with Jones; he has 30 years of experience.” The problem was that Jones didn’t have 30 years of experience, but one year of experience 30 times. The same can be said of President Biden and virtually all career politicians.<br />Jerry Molitor"
