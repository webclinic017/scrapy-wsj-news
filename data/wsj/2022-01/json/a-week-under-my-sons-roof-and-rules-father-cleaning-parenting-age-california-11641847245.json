    "body": "There comes a time for every family when the tables turn and the parent has to answer to the child. Mine came recently when my wife and I stayed with our elder son in Los Angeles—our first visit in several years and the longest since he moved west in 2014. A whole week under his roof!<br />“Dad, don’t leave the water running when you brush your teeth,” Nathaniel admonished on our first night. Ditto when I washed my hands.

But I also got busted for pulling extra paper towels to wipe the kitchen counter and was instructed to use the dishcloth, which didn’t seem sanitary."
