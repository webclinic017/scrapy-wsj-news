    "body": "The pandemic’s third year might bring declining benefit payouts to life-insurance policyholders. Whether that brings increasing benefits for shareholders depends on more than Covid-19.<br />Perhaps surprisingly, 2021 was a solid year for life-insurance stocks in the U.S., with the sector keeping up with financials overall and rising by about a third. While dealing with Covid-19 fatalities, large U.S. life insurers also had offsetting strong returns on their investment portfolios. Their variable-income portfolios—in asset classes such as equities and alternatives—delivered a roughly 10% to 20% bump in earnings over what was anticipated, according to Autonomous Research analyst Erik Bass. The flood of private-equity money into the industry has also enabled insurers to shift some of their risks onto others, and these moves were broadly rewarded in share prices."
