    "body": "U.S. stocks were poised for a fourth consecutive weekly loss as investors awaited earnings from  Chevron  and  Caterpillar ,  as well as the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge.<br />Futures for the S&P 500 wavered, adding 0.1%. The benchmark gauge of large-cap stocks has fallen 1.6% for the week, putting it on course for its longest losing streak since September 2020. Futures for the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 rose 0.5% and contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average were flat. Futures can be volatile and aren’t always a reliable indicator of where stock indexes will land at the opening bell."
