    "body": "SYDNEY—Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has lost access to his account on the Chinese-owned  WeChat  service, prompting a senior lawmaker to accuse Beijing of political interference ahead of an election due within months.<br />Mr. Morrison has been denied access to the account since July, which his supporters say deprives him of a key tool to communicate with a Chinese community in Australia of more than 1.2 million people. Earlier this month, the account was rebranded as Australia-China New Life after being taken over by a company from Fujian province in southern China."
