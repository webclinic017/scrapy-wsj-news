    "body": "The Supreme Court takes up President Biden’s vaccine mandate on Friday, and the stakes are larger than pandemic policy. This is a crucial test of how far the administrative state can go in stretching ambiguous statutes for its own political ends.<br />The Justices are hearing challenges to worker vaccine mandates by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The Fifth and Sixth Circuit Courts of Appeal handed down conflicted rulings on the OSHA mandate, while three federal judges have enjoined CMS in 25 states."
