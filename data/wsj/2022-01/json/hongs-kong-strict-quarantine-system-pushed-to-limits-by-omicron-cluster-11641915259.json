    "body": "HONG KONG—The limits of Hong Kong’s zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 are being tested as a cluster of community Omicron infections quickly fills up quarantine centers, prompting officials to move to shut many schools.<br />The financial center has some of the world’s strictest coronavirus containment regimes, requiring up to 21 days of quarantine for incoming travelers and close contacts of locally infected people. That worked well when Hong Kong enjoyed a monthslong streak of no locally transmitted cases. Now, with 42 community infections detected in the past two weeks as the Omicron variant spreads across the city, officials are running out of capacity and some experts are questioning if the policy of zero infections is sustainable."
