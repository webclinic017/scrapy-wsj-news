    "body": "Forget those infernal parties. If Boris Johnson’s tenure as U.K. prime minister comes to an abrupt end in the coming weeks or months—and it very well might—it won’t be because of a birthday bash. Instead, it will be because Mr. Johnson was foolish enough to buy into a lot of trendy theories concerning how parties of the political right need to remake themselves to win elections.<br />The prime minister is in trouble now most immediately thanks to a monthslong trickle of revelations about parties in his office-and-residence complex on London’s Downing Street. At least some of these get-togethers may have broken pandemic lockdown regulations in effect at the time."
