    "body": "Sen. Chuck Schumer’s Jan. 10 letter unintentionally highlights why the legislative filibuster should not be weakened. America’s founders never intended the Senate to be a smaller House of Representatives. With equal state representation, it was to serve as a bulwark against the tyranny of the majority.<br />Major legislation, especially acts establishing significant societal change, ought to have broad bipartisan support. The now-lost 60-vote advice-and-consent threshold for executive, diplomatic and judicial appointments, for example, produced far more moderate and broadly acceptable nominees."
