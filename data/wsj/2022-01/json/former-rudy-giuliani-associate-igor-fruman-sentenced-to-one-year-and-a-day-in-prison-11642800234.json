    "body": "A former associate of Rudy Giuliani was sentenced by a federal judge Friday to a year and a day in prison on a campaign-finance charge, capping the fall of a key figure in the first impeachment inquiry into former President Donald Trump.<br />Florida businessman Igor Fruman pleaded guilty in September in a New York federal court to soliciting a political contribution from a foreign national. Federal prosecutors accused him and others of conspiring to funnel money from a wealthy Russian businessman to influence American politics. Federal law prohibits foreign nationals from making political contributions in U.S. elections."
