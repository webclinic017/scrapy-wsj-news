    "body": "WASHINGTON—Antiabortion supporters rallied in the nation’s capital on Friday saying they were hopeful that the Supreme Court was on the cusp of overruling the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion legal nationwide.<br />The annual “March for Life” rally in Washington comes this year as the high court is reviewing the decades-old legal structure governing abortions across the U.S. and as several states have passed their own restrictions on abortion."
