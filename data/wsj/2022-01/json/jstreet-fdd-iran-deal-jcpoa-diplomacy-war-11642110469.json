    "body": "Mark Dubowitz and Matthew Kroenig were wrong when they worked to undermine the highly successful nuclear agreement with Iran (JCPOA), and they are wrong now in pushing President Biden toward military conflict with Iran (“Biden’s Moment of Truth in Iran,” op-ed, Jan. 6). The JCPOA successfully prevented Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb. Nuclear material was shipped out of the country, enrichment activities were restricted and inspectors were given unprecedented access to verify compliance. Messrs. Dubowitz, Kroenig and their allies fought to undo these achievements.<br />Messrs. Dubowitz and Kroenig hailed President Trump’s disastrous decision to unilaterally withdraw from the nuclear agreement, even though Iran was in compliance. Mr. Trump’s “maximum pressure” approach was an utter failure, strengthening Iranian hard-liners and leading them to increase uranium enrichment to unprecedented levels. Yet instead of owning up to their mistakes, the war hawks now place the blame for the current situation on failed diplomacy. Now they tell us that, as a result of policies they advocated, the U.S. must prepare to launch another costly war of choice in the Middle East."
