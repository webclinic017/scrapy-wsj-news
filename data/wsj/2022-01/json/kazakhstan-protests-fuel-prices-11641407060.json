    "body": "Mass protests in Kazakhstan over an increase in fuel prices have prompted the country’s authoritarian government to resign and President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev to declare a two-week state-of-emergency in western Mangistau region and in Almaty, the Central Asian nation’s largest city. The restrictions include an overnight curfew, a ban on mass gatherings and limitations on movement.<br />Since Sunday, protesters have taken to the streets and have clashed with security forces. Footage on social media showed cars set ablaze and police deploying tear gas as crowds swarmed the city center and tried to storm some government buildings. Reports by local Kazakh media and on the Telegram messenger platform reported gunfire and the sound of stun grenades. There were local media reports of gunfire at the presidential residence and mayor’s office in Almaty."
