    "body": "To those watching the funding of new financial-technology companies in 2021, the headlines were dramatic.<br />Funding for fintech startups soared to $131.5 billion last year from $49 billion in 2020, according to CB Insights. In 2020, investors created 27 fintech “unicorns,” or private companies with a value north of $1 billion; in 2021, the number of new unicorns reached 157. The number of exits, whether in the shape of an IPO or a merger or acquisition by a special-purpose vehicle, jumped 73%—giving early investors in those businesses fresh capital to redeploy in new fintech startups. The Bank for International Settlements, meanwhile, calculates that in the decade between 2010 and 2020, fintech companies attracted more than $1 trillion in new backing."
