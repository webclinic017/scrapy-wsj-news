    "body": "As many as 200 U.S. soldiers are involved in a fight alongside Kurdish-led forces to regain control of a Syrian prison attacked by Islamic State fighters, U.S. defense officials said, in the most serious test in years for the countryâ€™s small American military contingent.<br />The attempted prison break in the city of Hasakah was the worst attack by Islamic State in the nearly three years since the group lost control of its last territorial foothold in Syria in 2019. In fighting that has raged for almost a week, more than 100 people have been killed, and some 850 children who had been held in the prison have been trapped during the violence."
