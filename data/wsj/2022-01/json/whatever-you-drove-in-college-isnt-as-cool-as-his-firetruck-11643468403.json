    "body": "Sean Robinson, 22, a Chicago-based automotive restoration specialist, on his 1982 Mack CF firetruck, as told to A.J. Baime.<br />I have wanted a firetruck my whole life, and I’ve bid on several at various auctions. I found this one on Facebook—the prize in an online raffle. I think the owner was trying to raise money for his bar. So I decided, OK, I’m going all in on this one. I spent about $300 and bought something like 26 tickets. What do you know? In February of last year, I became the owner of my very own firetruck."
