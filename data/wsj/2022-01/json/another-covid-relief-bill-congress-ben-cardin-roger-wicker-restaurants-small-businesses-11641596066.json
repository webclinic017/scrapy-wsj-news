    "body": "Where did the $1.9 trillion in last March’s spending bill go? Apparently on things other than Covid relief. Health-care providers are begging the Biden Administration for more money. And Congress is cooking up another relief bill for small business, though it will never stop there.<br />The March bill included $50 billion for small businesses, including $28.6 billion in grants for restaurants, but this money has been depleted. Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin and Mississippi’s Roger Wicker are cobbling together another relief bill for restaurants. “The restaurant money is a fairness issue. Some restaurants got it and others did not,” Mr. Cardin said."
