    "body": "Miami Beach, Fla.<br />Many American museums have been founded by what we call, mostly semi-affectionately, characters. The Getty, the Hirshhorn and the Whitney are examples. The Wolfsonian in Miami Beach, founded by Mitchell “Micky” Wolfson Jr. (b. 1939), is another, but of a very different stripe. A former diplomat born into a wealthy Miami family, Mr. Wolfson collects propaganda, advertising posters, and objects of industrial design, all dating—with a few exceptions—from the late 19th century into the 1940s. When the owners of the warehouse in which the collection (by then approaching 200,000 objects) was housed decided to sell the building, Mr. Wolfson bought it in 1987 and renovated it into a fully functioning museum that opened to the public in 1995."
