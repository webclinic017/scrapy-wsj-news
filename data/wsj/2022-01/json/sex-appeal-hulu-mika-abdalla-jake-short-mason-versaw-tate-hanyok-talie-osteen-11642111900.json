    "body": "Sweetly idiotic would be a kind way of describing “Sex Appeal,” yet another adult-oriented comedy about eroticized teens that parents would probably prefer their children not be watching. There seems little danger of that.<br />Anyone older than 9 will be baffled by the premise, which doesn’t promise farce, exactly, but is certainly farcical. High-school senior Avery Hansen-White (Mika Abdalla), who walks the corridors like a runway model, “rules the school.” She has an off-the-usual-charts GPA, has gotten early acceptance and a “full ride” at MIT and is the previous year’s winner of “Stemcon,” a national competition for overachieving kids in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math."
