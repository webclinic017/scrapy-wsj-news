    "body": "One morning under an ominous sky, my friend Michael texted me a video of the Grateful Dead performing “Looks Like Rain.” He was right as, well, rain. Shortly afterward, the heavens opened and a deluge fell.<br />Sending an unsolicited musical and meteorological warning is a kindness Deadheads the world over routinely show one another. After grabbing my umbrella, I listened to the show and had to agree. The March 28, 1981, Rockpalast Festival performance of the song at Grugahalle in Essen, Germany, is tough to beat."
