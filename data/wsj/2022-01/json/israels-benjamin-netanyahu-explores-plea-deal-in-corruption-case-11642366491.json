    "body": "TEL AVIV—Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is exploring the option of a plea deal in corruption charges against him, according to people familiar with the talks, in a move that could decide the political fate of Israel’s longest-serving leader and upend the country’s politics.<br />The trial has become one of the starkest symbols of the reversal of fortunes for Mr. Netanyahu, who led the country for 15 years until he failed to form a government last spring. Prosecutors say Mr. Netanyahu accepted expensive gifts from wealthy businessmen in exchange for official favors and offered two media executives regulatory and financial benefits in exchange for positive press coverage."
