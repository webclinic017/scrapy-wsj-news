    "body": "Walter Russell Mead’s column “How to Halt Putin’s Ukraine Push” (Global View, Jan. 18) offers a compelling critique of the approach of the Biden administration to a Russian invasion of Ukraine. As he says, the threat of severe sanctions, even if they can be agreed on among allies, will not be enough. With the Afghan debacle in the background, the inadequate response to the threat to Ukraine will be a dress rehearsal for China and Taiwan. No one should think that China will fail to learn its lessons. The administration’s failure to craft, fund and implement a strong defense policy that might win Vladimir Putin’s respect has put the U.S. on the path to acquiescing in major changes in balances of power that will be unfavorable to us and our allies and to the fate of democracy in the world.<br />Donald L. Horowitz"
