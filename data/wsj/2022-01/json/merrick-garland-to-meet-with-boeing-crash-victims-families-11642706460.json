    "body": "WASHINGTON—Attorney General Merrick Garland plans to meet with families of people killed in two deadly crashes of  Boeing Co. ’s 737 MAX jet, who say prosecutors should have conferred with them before striking a $2.5 billion settlement with the aerospace company last year.<br />Mr. Garland intends to speak with family members and their lawyers within the next week, according to a court filing Wednesday. In December some of the families filed a motion asking a judge in Fort Worth, Texas, to find that their rights as crime victims were violated and to consider reopening Boeing’s deal with the government."
