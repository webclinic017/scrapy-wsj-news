    "body": "‘Turn this page,” warns the first sentence of “My Annihilation,” the latest psychological thriller by Fuminori Nakamura, “and you may give up your entire life.” The undaunted reader is soon immersed in a disturbing first-person account (memoir? confession? case study?) of one Ryodai Kozuka, a man terrorized by recollections of his traumatic childhood and its transgressive impulses.<br />Kozuka grows up with an abusive stepfather and a half-sister who torments him into fantasies of retribution. His mother leaves the marriage but takes up with other abusive men. The narrator retreats into a private world—“I was capable of focusing obsessively forever”—and is eventually placed in a center for troubled youth. The mature Kozuka becomes an indifferent “doctor of psychosomatic medicine,” his criminal fantasies buried in the past—until an emotionally fragile young woman asks him to psychoanalyze her. It seems her history is even more psychically fraught than his."
