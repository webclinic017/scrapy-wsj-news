    "body": "Flight cancellations are starting to slow down as airlines dig out from winter storms and adjust schedules to account for elevated worker absences due to surging Covid-19 cases.<br />Airlines continued to scrub flights over the weekend and Monday, but at a lower rate than in recent weeks. Some 775 flights to, from or within the U.S. were canceled Monday, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking site. If that level holds, it would end a 15-day streak of more than 1,000 daily flight cancellations——one of the most persistent disruptions in recent years."
