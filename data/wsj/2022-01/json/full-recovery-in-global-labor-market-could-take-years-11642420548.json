    "body": "It will take at least two years before global unemployment falls back to pre-pandemic levels, according to fresh projections, with joblessness in poor countries remaining high even as labor markets in rich countries become increasingly tight.<br />The pandemic upended the global labor market, initially sending unemployment soaring around the world. A surge in demand following the reopening of rich economies such as the U.S. created huge disruptions in labor markets, as companies scrambled for workers. But at the same time, a lack of vaccines in many poor countries is keeping unemployment high."
