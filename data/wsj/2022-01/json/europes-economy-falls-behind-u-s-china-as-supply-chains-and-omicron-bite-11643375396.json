    "body": "FRANKFURT—The eurozone economy slowed sharply at the end of last year, lagging behind the recovery in the larger U.S. and Chinese economies, as high energy prices, supply-chain bottlenecks and new social restrictions weighed on consumer spending and the region’s large manufacturing sector.<br />Data from three of Europe’s biggest economies published Friday show swaths of the region still lag below their pre-pandemic level of output, a level that the U.S. surpassed by the middle of last year. China’s economy, the world’s second-largest, briskly exceeded its precrisis level in 2020 but has recently slowed sharply amid a property-market slump."
