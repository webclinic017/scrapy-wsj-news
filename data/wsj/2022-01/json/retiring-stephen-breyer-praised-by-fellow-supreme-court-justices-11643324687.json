    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court’s other eight justices all praised their retiring colleague, Stephen Breyer, on Thursday, unanimously citing his intellect, humor and civility.<br />Still, in a reminder of ideological splits within the court, liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, joined by conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, highlighted Justice Breyer’s role in forging consensus, something that may be in short supply as his final term winds down with divisive issues such as abortion and gun control on the docket."
