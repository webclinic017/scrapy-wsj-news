    "body": "Amazon.com Inc.  is reducing how long its U.S.-based workers must isolate after testing positive for Covid-19 after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently shortened its quarantine guidance for people infected with the virus.<br />The online retail giant said in a memo to employees Friday that those with positive tests can return to work after isolating for seven days. That is a longer period than the one recommended by the CDC, which reduced its isolation guidance from 10 days to five. The agency also recommends that people should wear a mask for another five days after isolating."
