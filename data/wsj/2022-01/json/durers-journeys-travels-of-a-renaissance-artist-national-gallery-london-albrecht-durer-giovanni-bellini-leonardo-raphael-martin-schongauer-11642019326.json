    "body": "London<br />It may seem unlikely, but liberal democracy and the free, modern individual are accidental byproducts of the religious control and spiritual discipline of the Reformation in northern Europe. The German printmaker and painter Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528) exemplifies both the culture that produced the Reformation—the proto-capitalist artisanal workshops of the German cities, and a bookish but furious spiritual discontent—and the culture that the Reformation produced: the puritan Protestant International, the artist as celebrity, and, ultimately, the ennui of Hamlet."
