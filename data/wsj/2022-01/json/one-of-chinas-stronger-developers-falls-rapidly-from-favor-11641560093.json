    "body": "A rout in the bonds and shares of  Shimao Group Holdings Ltd.  shows how fragile market confidence is toward Chinese property developers—and how quickly even stronger-looking companies can fall from favor.<br />On Friday, several of Shimao’s dollar bonds were quoted at less than 40 cents on the dollar, indicating serious doubt that creditors won’t be repaid in full. The selloff represents a sharp comedown for the company, which as recently as November held investment-grade status with two of the world’s big credit-rating agencies."
