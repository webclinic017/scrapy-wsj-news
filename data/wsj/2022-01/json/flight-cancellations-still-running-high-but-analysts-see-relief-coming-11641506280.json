    "body": "The frustrations for travelers continued Thursday as airlines canceled more than 1,000 flights for the 12th straight day, but industry analysts say relief is on the way.<br />The airline industry has struggled to handle the dual challenge of inclement weather coinciding with an influx of ill crew members infected with Covid-19 as the highly transmissible Omicron variant drives a surge in cases nationwide. But the wave of cancellations is thought likely to ease once infection rates fall and the weather improves, rather than the rough patch becoming a longer-term trend."
