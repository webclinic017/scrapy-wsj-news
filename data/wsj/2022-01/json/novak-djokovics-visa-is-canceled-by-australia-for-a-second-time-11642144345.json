    "body": "SYDNEY—Australia canceled Novak Djokovic’s visa for a second time, just days before the World’s No. 1 men’s tennis player was scheduled to appear in the Australian Open.<br />Immigration minister Alex Hawke said Friday he was acting in the public interest when he made the decision to cancel the visa held by Djokovic, whose fight with the Australian government over his entry thrust him to the center of the global debate over Covid-19 vaccine mandates. With cases in the country surging, Hawke said authorities were committed to protecting Australia’s borders."
