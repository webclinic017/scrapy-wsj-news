    "body": "American manufacturers ran a wee bit less hot last month. How that happened is what matters.<br />On Tuesday the Institute for Supply Management said that its index of manufacturing activity slipped to 58.7 in December from 61.1 in November. Anything over 50 counts as an expansion in activity, so it isn’t as if factories weren’t still very busy last month. Economists had expected to see activity recede more slowly, though."
