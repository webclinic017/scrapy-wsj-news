    "body": "Last April, virologist Jesse Bloom wanted to examine sequences of the genetic code of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The sequences, which contain instructions that the virus uses to make copies of itself, can change as the virus spreads from person to person. Dr. Bloom, who runs a lab focused on the evolution of viruses at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, thought that the mutations might allow him to track the pandemic back to its beginnings, a bit like the way detectives use DNA evidence to solve crimes.<br />But when he went to the public database maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health to find data about Covid-19 patients in early 2020 in Wuhan, China, the files werenâ€™t there. He later learned that the sequences had been removed from public access in June 2020 at the request of the Wuhan University researcher who deposited them. NIH rules say that the data belong to the individual who submits them."
