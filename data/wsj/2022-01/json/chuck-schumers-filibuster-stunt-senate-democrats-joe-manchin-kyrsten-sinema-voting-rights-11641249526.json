    "body": "If you thought 2022 might see a return to the more “normal” politics that Democrats promised in 2020 but failed to deliver in 2021, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wants to disabuse you. On Monday he announced that Democrats will revive their crusade to transform Congress by eliminating the Senate filibuster on the narrowest of partisan votes.<br />Mr. Schumer’s letter denounces the 60-vote rule for most legislation (which he’s made use of throughout his career) and says the Senate will “consider changes to Senate rules on or before January 17” for legislation to “protect the foundation of our democracy.”"
