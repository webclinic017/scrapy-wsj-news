    "body": "LONDON—British police Tuesday announced an investigation into parties that took place in Downing Street during lockdowns, raising pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose popularity has fallen sharply in the wake of the revelations.<br />Mr. Johnson has said he attended an event billed as a “bring your own booze” gathering in the Downing Street garden, at a time when lockdown rules said that Britons could only meet one person outdoors. The prime minister has apologized and said he thought it was a work event."
