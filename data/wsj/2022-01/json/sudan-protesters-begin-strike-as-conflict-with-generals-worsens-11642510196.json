    "body": "Pro-democracy groups began two days of strikes and civil disobedience in Sudan on Tuesday, a day after security forces fired live rounds and used tear gas to disperse protesters in some of the deadliest clashes since a military coup last year.<br />At least seven people were killed and hundreds injured in clashes on Monday as security forces repelled crowds attempting to advance on the presidential palace in Khartoum. The standoff marked a major escalation in tensions between the coup leaders and the growing protest movement, as diplomatic efforts to end the unrest faltered."
