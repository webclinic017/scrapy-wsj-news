    "body": "In location, size and population, Vermont and California couldn’t be more different. But eight years after Vermont’s effort to enact a state single-payer healthcare system went over a cliff, California is galloping toward the same precipice. Lawmakers in Sacramento should have learned from Montpelier’s experience. Instead, they seem eager to repeat it.<br />Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin campaigned on a promise to enact single  payer but shelved his plans in 2014. The idea was “just not affordable,” he said after getting a look at the cost to Vermont’s economy. “We were pretty shocked at the tax rates we were going to have to charge.” The single-payer bill pending in the California Legislature goes far beyond the proposals Vermont considered."
