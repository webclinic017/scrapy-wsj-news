    "body": "On Sunday in Kansas City’s Arrowhead Stadium, two men with small hands and large hearts will lead their respective teams in a contest to decide who will represent the American Football Conference in the Super Bowl. Outside the stadium in the hours before the game, a friendly competition is expected to produce only winners. But fans will have their hands full overcoming a rare challenge.<br />Two years ago this column lamented that security rules for the Super Bowl prevented Kansas City Chiefs fans from reaching their potential in a game they play better than anyone else: pregame food and frivolity.
