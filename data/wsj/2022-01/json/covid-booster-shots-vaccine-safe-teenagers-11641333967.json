    "body": "Science is never perfect and the recommendations for managing Covid-19 have been based not on irrefutable scientific evidence but interpretation of messy data. I agree with Marty Makary (“The Dangerous Push to Give Boosters to Teens,” op-ed, Dec. 22) that sometimes public-health recommendations have been unnecessarily barbarous, but the recommendation for those ages 16 to 17 to receive a vaccine booster does not fall in that category.<br />Dr. Makary highlights the differences between the vote of a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel on the results of a single study and the ultimate decision by the FDA to approve booster vaccination for people older than 16. The panel considered a narrow scientific question, but the FDA proceeded with approval based on the totality of evidence and its responsibility for the social consequences of policies it issues."
