After a week of fun and wild-eyed frustration with the 2022 Volkswagen Golf R—the hottest version of the eighth-generation Golf hatchback—I was ready to scold VW’s product planners. Never has so good a car been so let down by its touchscreen, software and switchgear.<br />But I just don’t have the heart. It’s not like the R’s deciders wanted to put a one-eyed, lowest-bidder monstrosity smack in the middle of their flagship Golf R—historically, a leader in interior quality and cabin design among hot hatches. But they had a number to hit, a belt to tighten, and nobody was going home until they did."
