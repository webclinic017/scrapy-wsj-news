    "body": "TEL AVIVâ€”Israel reopened its borders, the U.K. relaxed travel restrictions and the Biden administration signaled that Americans should accept Covid-19 as a part of daily life, as authorities bet that vaccinations will help them ride out the surge in Omicron infections.<br />Israel lifted its ban on travel for all countries early Friday and removed barriers for in-person classes in schools. It was one of the first countries globally to close its borders last month as the government sought to buy time to expand its vaccination campaign and take other measures. As infections rise sharply, Israeli officials say these restrictions are futile now."
