    "body": "Southwest Airlines Co.<br />The New Year didn’t bring clear skies for airlines. Carriers canceled more than 1,000 daily U.S. flights for 13 straight days as of Friday, as the industry struggled with Omicron-fueled staffing shortages and inclement weather challenges. But analysts say the wave of cancellations is likely to ease once infection rates fall and weather improves, instead of becoming a longer-term trend. Southwest shares rose 3.3% Friday."
