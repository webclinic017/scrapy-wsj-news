    "body": "‘You need to be able to leave the building,” Mandy (Sosie Bacon) tells her housebound client, Harrison (Albert Rutecki), one of the autistic characters in the comedy-drama “As We See It.” Harrison, looking for a way out of going out, wants to know why. “So you can do things,” Mandy argues. “Go see friends. Go to the movies. Shop.” Has she been outside in a while? She’s not making much of a case.<br />The show does. Based on the award-winning Israeli series “On the Spectrum” (and set in a pre- or post-pandemic world), the eight-part “As We See It” is about the life of young adults with autism trying to negotiate what other people would consider normal life—working, dating, socially interacting without incident. The struggle is real, but as we pick up early on, the remedies are not just about the autistic dealing with themselves. It’s about the rest of the world dealing with their autism—something that provides the net in a show that, by definition, is walking a comedic high wire."
