    "body": "The title of “The Woman in the House Across the Street From the Girl in the Window” isn’t just a mouthful, it’s a spoiler—not on the level of “Death of a Salesman,” maybe, but a spoiler nonetheless. While it suggests any number of similarly plotted thrillers, including “The Girl on the Train,” “Gone Girl,” “Rear Window” and “The House at the End of the Street,” the eight-part Netflix series isn’t just a genre parody. It spoofs a specific film—namely “The Woman in the Window,” last year’s feature starring Amy Adams that made such a lukewarm splash on Netflix. Whether Ms. Adams has discussed this new project with its star, Kristen Bell, is unknown. But it’s an intriguing thing to ponder.<br />So is the fact that Netflix is mocking its own product, while offering reviewers the opportunity to provide spoilers on two shows at the same time."
