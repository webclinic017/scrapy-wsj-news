    "body": "The extra yield that Chinese government bonds offer over U.S. Treasurys this week dropped below a percentage point for the first time in nearly three years, as the central banks of the world’s two largest economies move in opposite directions.<br />The narrowing gap, reflecting both a rally in Chinese bonds and a U.S. selloff, reduces one longstanding argument in favor of foreign investors buying more Chinese debt. But analysts and investors say the long-term torrent of international money pouring into Chinese fixed-income markets is likely to continue."
