    "body": "VITAMIN D deficiency may be trending but, happily, so is a simple and delicious antidote. Over the past couple of years, tinned fish has become a Covid kitchen craze rivaling sourdough, beans and meal kits. As Americans have embraced a world of quality delicacies–ranging from Spanish white anchovies to Korean mackerel to Icelandic cod liver–new online purveyors have joined the fray and veterans have stocked up. Sales have soared, nurturing a cultish devotion and spawning cookbooks, monthly subscription services and even social media “fish porn.”<br />It’s easy to understand the enthusiasm: Fish in a can (or a jar) is a ready-to-eat convenience and a shelf-stable pantry item that’s jam-packed with a whole host of nutrients on top of that elusive D. It is also cost-effective, portable and a great ingredient for boosting a recipe’s umami factor–though hardcore devotees dine straight from the can, requiring nothing more than a cracker as companion. Here, some of the best sources for your finned feasts, plus a cod liver oil you won’t find hard to swallow."
