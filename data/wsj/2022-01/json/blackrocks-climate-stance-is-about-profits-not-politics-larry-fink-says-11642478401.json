    "body": "Larry Fink’s efforts to get companies to adopt climate-friendly policies have led some to call him an activist. The  BlackRock Inc.  chairman and chief executive prefers a different label: capitalist.<br />In his annual letter to the CEOs of the companies in which BlackRock invests, Mr. Fink said businesses that don’t plan for a carbon-free future risk being left behind. The quest for long-term returns, and not politics, is what animates the money manager’s efforts, he wrote."
