    "body": "IN OUR QUEST to age backward, new high-tech microcurrent facial tools are the latest trick. Once only used in spa settings, these devices send low-level electrical currents through the skin to exercise the muscles and stimulate collagen. While the gadgets haven’t been thoroughly evaluated by large, independent research studies, Dr. Scott Paviol, a dermatologist in Charlotte, N.C., said they could work to “improve the [skin’s] appearance and contour.” Don’t expect facelift-style results. But a little glow-up could be just the lift you need.<br />The Foreo Bear Mini relies on a built-in anti-shock system that automatically adjusts the intensity according to your skin’s condition. Download the app, connect the device via Bluetooth, and apply the Swedish brand’s serum gel ($59) evenly to the area that you’re planning to treat. Pick from three microcurrent intensities, and choose a workout, demonstrated and timed by an on-screen model. The device switches off when each zone is done, so you won’t overwork one area. If the preset routines feel limiting, just switch to manual mode. $199, Foreo.com"
