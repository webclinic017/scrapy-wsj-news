    "body": "The celebrated postmodern architect Robert Venturi added an extension to Bard College’s Stevenson Library in 1993. His polychrome brick building—with a masking façade of yellow, orange, purple and olive panels—was intended to blend with the original library: an 1893 Greek-revival re-creation of the Parthenon.<br />There’s less effort today to blend old and new on the campus in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. Bard recently announced that three undergraduates, funded by the Office of Inclusive Excellence, are working their way through Stevenson Library, “evaluating each book for representations of race/ethnicity, gender, religion, and ability.”"
