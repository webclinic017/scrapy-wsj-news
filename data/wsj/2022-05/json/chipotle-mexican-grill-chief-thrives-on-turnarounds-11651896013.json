    "body": "Brian Niccol took the reins of  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.  when the burrito chain’s sales had plummeted after a series of food-safety scares. The longtime marketer had just faced similar food-quality concerns at a Mexican chain rival.<br />Mr. Niccol was appointed Taco Bell’s chief marketing officer in 2011, the year a disgruntled customer filed a lawsuit alleging that its taco mixture was more filler than beef. The suit was withdrawn, but the publicity hurt Taco Bell’s reputation. The Yum Brands Inc. division’s cachet had also fallen, with the brand coming to be known more for being cheap than for being cool."
