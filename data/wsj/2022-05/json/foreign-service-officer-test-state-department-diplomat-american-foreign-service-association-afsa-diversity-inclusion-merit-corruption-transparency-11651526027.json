    "body": "Since 1924, anyone who wants to become an American diplomat has had to pass a rigorous written exam, the Foreign Service Officer Test. Now the State Department says it wants to “modernize its hiring process to create a more inclusive workforce that hires the best talent and represents America’s rich diversity.” While candidates will still take the exam, starting in June there will no longer be a pass/fail score, so applicants who score poorly may still be hired.<br />The exam has long been regarded as difficult. In a 1995 interview, veteran diplomat John Edgar Williams recalled that in 1953 the test took 3½ days and covered everything from astronomy to zoology. When I started taking it in the 1990s, it took three hours and consisted of a job knowledge section along with the kind of general questions contestants answer on “Jeopardy!,” an English grammar and usage section, and an essay, which wasn’t graded unless you met the cut-off score. In a typical year, 10,000 to 20,000 people take the exam and 2% to 3% of those are hired. The test expires after 18 months; I passed several times before I was offered a job in 2001."
