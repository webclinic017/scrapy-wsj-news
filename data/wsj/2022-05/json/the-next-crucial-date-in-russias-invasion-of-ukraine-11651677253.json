    "body": "Vladimir Putin’s assault on Kyiv has failed. His Black Sea Fleet flagship, the Moskva, has been sunk. His soldiers are dying in Ukraine at an extraordinary rate, with as many as 15,000 killed during the first five weeks of the war, more than the Soviet Union lost during a decade in Afghanistan. And he needs a victory fast. Russia is approaching a critical date next week that has become the most important day of the political calendar for Putin’s regime.<br />May 9 is Victory Day in Russia, marking the anniversary of the end of World War II, or as it is known there, the Great Patriotic War. Putin has elevated the memory of that conflict to the status of a national religion in recent years, as he has exploited the war to rally support for his leadership, and transformed Victory Day into the country’s most important national holiday. Russian troops were reportedly originally told they must win the war in Ukraine by May 9, in time for the Victory Day celebrations, and the Ukrainian military says it recovered dress uniforms from abandoned Russian positions outside Kyiv, presumably intended to be worn for a triumphant parade once they had captured the city."
