    "body": "This week’s conventional wisdom holds that state Sen. Doug Mastriano won the Pennsylvania Republican gubernatorial primary by inciting voters with claims of a stolen 2020 election. Let’s see how that analysis holds up if and when Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp crushes his primary challenger next week.<br />That’s the same Mr. Kemp whom Donald Trump has branded “the worst ‘election integrity’ Governor in the country.” In 2020 Mr. Kemp refused calls to overturn his state’s election results, and Mr. Trump has since been on a vendetta. He stoked former Sen. David Perdue into challenging Mr. Kemp last year, and then handed him his “complete and total endorsement.” Mr. Perdue, who lost a January 2021 runoff to Democrat Jon Ossoff, has run a straight-up “stop the steal” campaign, saying at a March Trump rally: “Let me be very clear. Very clear. In the state of Georgia, thanks to Brian Kemp, our elections were absolutely stolen. He sold us out.”"
