    "body": "When Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, few analysts predicted that days later Russian troops would be crying on camera, texting their parents for help, and voluntarily surrendering to Ukrainian forces.<br />One common explanation for this surprising turn of events emphasizes the Russian military’s use of conscripts with limited skills and low morale, which may signal Vladimir Putin’s desperation and show that he has few options. But the Ukrainian military also includes conscripts and does not seem to have suffered from similar personnel problems."
