    "body": "Investors in  Wayfair  are getting hit by a double whammy.<br />The online furniture seller already was dealing with sales declines as consumers turned their attention from online shopping to in-person stores. Now, the company must also contend with slowing general demand for furnishings and other big-ticket items. In the first quarter, furniture sellers saw revenue grow 2.9% from a year earlier, a substantial slowdown from the 10%-plus year-over-year growth rate logged in the two preceding quarters, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Big-ticket items in general are a tougher sell these days; stores selling electronics and appliances actually recorded a 3.3% decline in the first quarter, even as sales at supermarkets and clothing stores grew at healthy paces of 9.1% and 16.7%, respectively."
