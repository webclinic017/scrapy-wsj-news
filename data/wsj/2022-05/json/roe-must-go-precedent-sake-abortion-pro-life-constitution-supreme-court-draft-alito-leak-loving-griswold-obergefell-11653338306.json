    "body": "For decades, every argument about Supreme Court precedent has been a proxy war over Roe v. Wade (1973). Anytime the justices questioned a precedent, their opinions were read as clues for the future of Roe.<br />Now that Roe itself is at stake in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the script has flipped. Critics of Justice Samuel Alito’s leaked draft opinion charge that overturning Roe would condemn other precedents: Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), establishing the right to contraception; Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), the right to same-sex marriage; even Loving v. Virginia (1967), the right to marry regardless of race."
