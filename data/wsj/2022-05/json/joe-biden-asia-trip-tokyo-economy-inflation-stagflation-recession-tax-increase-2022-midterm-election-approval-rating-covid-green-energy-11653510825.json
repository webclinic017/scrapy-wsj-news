    "body": "Most Americans will spend Memorial Day weekend with family and friends. Democrats campaigning for re-election will spend it in hell—gasoline prices through the roof, inflated prices forcing bargain-brand picnic food onto the table, stocks close to a bear market, constituents looking up the difference between recession and stagflation and the president is . . . Joe Biden, whose falling approval rating has become the political future’s most reliable indicator.<br />Mr. Biden spent his week in Asia talking about the economy back home. Aficionados of how the president arranges reality have noted that the Putin-did-it rationale for the troubled U.S. economy is giving way to the argument that it’s an economy “in transition.”"
