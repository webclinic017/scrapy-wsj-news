    "body": "The Taliban issued a decree last weekend ordering the women of Afghanistan to wear an all-covering veil, ideally the burqa, in public. If a woman doesn’t follow this rule, her male “guardian” could face jail time. This is only the latest example of how the Taliban, who seized power over Afghanistan last summer, haven’t changed much since their brutal rule in 1996-2001.<br />In the ’90s, women who traveled alone or failed to wear a burqa were lashed in public. The “new” Taliban are keen to avoid graphic scenes as they try to save face internationally amid an economic catastrophe. But the basic idea is the same: If the Taliban consider something a religious obligation, the group will use force to ensure the population complies."
