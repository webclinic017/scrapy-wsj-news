    "body": "Amazon  founder Jeff Bezos’ purchase of the Washington Post in 2013 for $250 million was roughly equivalent to anyone else whimsically spending a few thousand dollars on a chest of drawers in an antique store. The price of whimsy has risen. Elon Musk had to assemble $44 billion to obtain the  Twitter  bauble.<br />A multibillionaire’s takeover of the Post caused palpitations among the Beltway press, but that passed. In the event, the Post was left free by its owner to spend two years of the Trump presidency pushing the unproven Russia collusion narrative, which helped create the swamp of disinformation."
