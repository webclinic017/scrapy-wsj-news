    "body": "Bad inflation datapoints are common these days, and Tuesday’s news is that eurozone consumer prices rose 8.1% in May. Is European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde still on the job?<br />May’s number is the fastest eurozone inflation since the euro was introduced in 1999. The average conceals much faster inflation in major European economies. It’s 8.7% in Germany, 10.2% in the Netherlands and 8.5% in Spain. Even relative laggards France (5.8%) and Italy (7.3%) are witnessing faster price rises than any time in recent memory."
