    "body": "Friday’s paper brought important news about shrinking GDP, a loss at Amazon and aid for Ukraine. For me, however, the most significant item was Joe Morgenstern’s last column “So Long to the Dark Full of Light” (Arts in Review, April 29).<br />I have been a subscriber during Mr. Morgenstern’s 27 years at the Journal, and I always looked forward to Friday on his account. Partly it was his writing skills: When he was excited about a film, he expressed his enchantment; when he had to skewer someone, he applied the knife with literary finesse. Mostly it was because Mr. Morgenstern satisfied the main purpose of film critics: finding films the reader would like to see. If he enjoyed a film, there was a 95% chance I would like it, too. On the flip side, Mr. Morgenstern spared me from wasting many hours on unworthy films. Farewell, Joe, and thank you."
