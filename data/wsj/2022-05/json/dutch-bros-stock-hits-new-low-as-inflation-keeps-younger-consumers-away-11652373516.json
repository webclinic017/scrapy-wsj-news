    "body": "Dutch Bros Inc.â€™s  shares plunged to new lows Thursday after the company warned of slowing sales growth as inflation keeps younger customers away from their afternoon coffee breaks.<br />The drive-through coffee chain on Wednesday said that it expects same-store sales, a key industry metric that reflects sales at locations open at least 15 months, would be flat for the year, down from an earlier view of rising in the mid-single-digit percent range."
