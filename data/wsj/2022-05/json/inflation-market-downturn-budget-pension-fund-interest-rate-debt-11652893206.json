    "body": "Red Jahncke hits the nail on the head: “Swooning Markets Will Crush Government Budgets” (op-ed, May 17). He emphasizes declining tax revenues, but the fall in the markets will have at least two other major adverse budgetary impacts worth noting.<br />First, tens of millions of Americans are receiving income from pension funds. Declining pension-fund assets will push many funds into somewhat precarious financial condition, forcing increased contributions to maintain pensions. In the private sector, this might threaten corporate profits. For state and local governments, where many pension funds are already only around 70% funded, this will force bigger employee or government contributions, benefit reductions or both."
