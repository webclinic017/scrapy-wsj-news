    "body": "As a Latter-day Saint Christian, I read with interest Daryl Austin’s Houses of Worship column “About Those ‘Dangerous’ Mormons. . .” (May 6), on Hulu’s production of “Under the Banner of Heaven.” I’m not surprised that Latter-day Saints are portrayed as dangerous, dark and demented people in that TV series. After all, isn’t anti-Mormon bigotry the one safe bigotry left in America today? Ironically, it is one of the few things that leftists and evangelicals can have in common.<br />Anthonie H. Woller"
