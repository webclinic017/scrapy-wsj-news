    "body": "Sequels are often bland imitations of the original, but the European Union’s sixth package of economic sanctions includes a dramatic new twist: a ban on Russian oil.<br />On Wednesday, the European Commission proposed a ban on EU purchases of Russian crude within six months and refined products by the end of the year.
