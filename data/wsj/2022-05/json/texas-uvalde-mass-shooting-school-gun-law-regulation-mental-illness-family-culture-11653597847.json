    "body": "Your editorial “Young Men, Guns and Guardrails” (May 26) is correct that stricter gun laws won’t end mass shootings and that the urge for “action, any kind of action,” as former President Barack Obama suggested, is no way to guide policy. But this doesn’t necessarily support a larger conclusion about gun regulations.<br />Let us posit a rigorous and universal system of background checks for the purchase of assault rifles with high-capacity magazines. It would disqualify not only those with criminal records but also those with a history of specific mental illnesses as well as buyers under age 21. Such a system unquestionably would be underinclusive—some deranged people would still find a way to acquire the weapons. It would also be overinclusive—screening out many who pose no risk."
