    "body": "As night follows day, the economic problems caused by government are invariably followed by government solutions that would make everything worse. For a classic of the genre, consider the bill introduced by Democratic Senators to fight inflation by attacking price “gouging.”<br />Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and seven Democratic colleagues in the Senate and six in the House want to punish companies that raise prices more than they like. The result would be price controls by another name, and they would produce what price controls always do—supply shortages. If you like today’s baby formula mess, pass this bill."
