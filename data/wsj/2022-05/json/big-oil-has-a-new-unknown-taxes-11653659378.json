    "body": "Politicians want greater energy independence. They also want to cut carbon emissions. Most of all, though, they want votes.<br />The conflicting priorities of policy makers shaped a tortuous path to a new tax on oil-and-gas profits in the U.K., finally announced Thursday after much wrangling and leaking. The “energy profits levy” adds an extra 25% to the existing 40% headline tax rate on the industry’s local earnings. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government expects it to raise about £5 billion, or $6.3 billion, in its first 12 months."
