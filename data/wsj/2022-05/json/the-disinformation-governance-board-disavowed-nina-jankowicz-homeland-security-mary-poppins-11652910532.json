    "body": "Quick as she came, the Mary Poppins of Disinformation unfurled her umbrella and floated away to her next job, nannying another nation of children who had the wrong ideas. Nina Jankowicz, age 33, was supposed to lead the Department of Homeland Security’s new Disinformation Governance Board.<br />Only three weeks after that announcement, media reports say the board is being “paused” and Ms. Jankowicz has resigned. It isn’t difficult to see why. “You can just call me the Mary Poppins of disinformation,” she tweeted last year, with a video of herself singing modified song lyrics to “Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.”"
