    "body": "In the past six weeks, $1 trillion in cryptocurrency value has evaporated—yes, trillion. Since there was nothing of economic value driving up crypto prices, only mass delusion, there hasn’t been much to cushion their descent. It’s as if a giant bellows has been blowing hot air into bitcoin and others, and it suddenly stopped working. Fanboys yelling “store of value” and “fiat hedge” can’t seem to explain why bitcoin is falling as inflation rages.<br />This column noted a few weeks ago the risks of “algorithmic stablecoin” Terra, backed by the Luna token. Terra was designed to stay at $1, and Luna tokens would be issued to buy Terra if it dropped below $1. Well, it did last week, dropping to below 20 cents. So many Luna tokens needed to be issued that Luna’s price dropped more than 99% in 24 hours and it is now worth 3/100ths of a cent, down from $60 seven days ago. Ouch. Things happen fast. Remember the initial public offering last year for Coinbase, the crypto exchange, which traded at close to a $100 billion valuation? It’s now $18 billion. Too many momentum investors late to the crypto party traded real money for fake currency and lost."
