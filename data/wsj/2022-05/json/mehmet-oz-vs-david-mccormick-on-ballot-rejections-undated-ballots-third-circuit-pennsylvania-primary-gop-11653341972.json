    "body": "After a week of counting ballots, Mehmet Oz’s lead in the Pennsylvania GOP Senate primary has fallen to 992 votes. Down, down it goes, and where it stops nobody knows. Pennsylvania’s sluggish processing of absentee ballots is bad enough, but every time the margin narrows, it raises the odds that this will turn into a larger mail-vote fiasco.<br />As of Monday, plenty of ballots were up in the air, including 2,000 provisional votes from both parties in Allegheny County. That’s a stronghold for Mr. Oz’s rival, David McCormick. The two sides are also jockeying over mail ballots that voters neglected to date. Mr. McCormick wants them counted, since he’s winning 32% of mail votes statewide, versus 23% for Mr. Oz, who is urging the opposite."
