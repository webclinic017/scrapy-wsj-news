    "body": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi isnâ€™t known for keeping his head down and working silently on a goal. Fanfare and zealous speeches are more on brand. The latest case in point: his speech at the Semicon India 2022 conference in late April, pitching India as a potential semiconductor manufacturing hub.<br />This goal, however, may require some humility and patience, particularly when leading economies like the U.S., Germany and Japan have already attracted large investments from top chip makers. And unlike manufacturing powerhouse China, which is also vying to be a serious global chip-making player, India lacks a robust domestic market for chips."
