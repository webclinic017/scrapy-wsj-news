    "body": "Finland and Sweden will soon apply for membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Once they do, the allies will first deliberate collectively and then begin a member-by-member ratification process. They should proceed quickly to close any window of opportunity Russia might exploit before these two applicants are covered by NATO’s Article 5 mutual-defense commitment and America’s nuclear umbrella.<br />Inviting both countries into the alliance will complicate NATO defense planning. Even though Finland and Sweden cooperate about as closely with NATO as any nonmembers could, extending Article 5 to them will require careful and detailed planning. This is especially so in the land domain when it comes to Finland, given its 830-mile border with Russia, and in the maritime domain when it comes to Sweden, considering the thousands of islands it has in the Baltic Sea, including strategically important Gotland."
