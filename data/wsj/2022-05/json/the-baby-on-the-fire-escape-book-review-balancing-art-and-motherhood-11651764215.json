    "body": "Is it possible to be both a great mother and a great artist? As every mother knows, childrearing can be sublime and stupefying, thrilling and exhausting. And like creative work, you can lose yourself in it, but also find yourself. The novelist Jane Smiley put it this way: “Far from depriving me of thought, motherhood gave me new and startling things to think about and the motivation to do the hard work of thinking.”<br />In “The Baby on the Fire Escape: Creativity, Motherhood, and the Mind-Baby Problem,” Julie Phillips explores how maternity has affected artists and writers—particularly those born in the 1930s, who came of age in the postwar years when women were expected to stay at home with their children. Her focus is on the tug-of-war between books and babies, poetry and prams, art and adolescents. She is interested in the way divided attention and constant interruptions can conspire, along with maternal bliss and maternal guilt, “to erode creative work.”"
