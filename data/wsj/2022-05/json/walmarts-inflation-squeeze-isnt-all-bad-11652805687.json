    "body": "For  Walmart ,  a retailer that obsessively strives for everyday low prices, inflation has turned out to be quite the double-edged sword.<br />On the one hand, a price-sensitive consumer is just what Walmart needs to grow its business. America’s largest retailer on Tuesday reported healthy revenue, with comparable sales in the Walmart U.S. business (excluding fuel) up 3% in the quarter ended April 29 compared with a year earlier. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha were expecting growth of less than 2%. Including Sam’s Club and the international business, Walmart’s total sales were up 2.6% in constant currency, exceeding Wall Street’s expectations."
