    "body": "Indonesia, the world’s largest producer of palm oil, is set to lift its ban on exports of the agricultural commodity starting Monday, a move expected to reduce cooking-oil prices around the world.<br />The Southeast Asian country, which makes up nearly 60% of the world’s palm-oil production, issued far-reaching export restrictions on palm-oil products in late April as cooking-oil prices soared at home. The decision exacerbated a global shortage of edible oils after the war in Ukraine choked off exports of sunflower oil from that country."
