    "body": "A fall in the value of previously buzzy tech stocks will make it difficult for luxury company Richemont to unload its most troublesome brand, Yoox Net-a-Porter.<br />On Friday, shares in the maker of Cartier watches and jewelry, formally known as  Compagnie Financière Richemont ,  dropped 13.1%. The company’s operating profit for the year through March was around a 10th below the 3.8 billion euros, equivalent to $4 billion, expected by analysts, although this is partly explained by costs linked to the company’s decision to stop selling its goods in Russia. But investors also wanted a detailed update on talks between  Farfetch  and YNAP about some kind of tie-up, which didn’t materialize."
