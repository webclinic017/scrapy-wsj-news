    "body": "A Chinese immigrant found a note stuck in the door of his New Jersey home in September 2018: “If you are willing to go back to mainland [China] and spend 10 years in prison, your wife and children will be all right. That’s the end of this matter!” Welcome to Operation Sky Net, a campaign launched by the Chinese government in 2015 to repatriate overseas “fugitives” through any means.<br />Under this program, Chinese police and security personnel routinely conduct illegal operations in other countries. Their activities in the U.S. violate their victims’ constitutional rights and make a mockery of our nation’s sovereignty. The U.S. government and law-enforcement community rarely speak out about these acts, much less prosecute the perpetrators. That has to change."
