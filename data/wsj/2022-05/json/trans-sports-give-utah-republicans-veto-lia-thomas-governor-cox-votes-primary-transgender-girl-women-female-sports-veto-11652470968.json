    "body": "Daniel Thatcher thought he’d thrown away his political career. The 45-year-old Utah state senator had been one of a small number of Republican legislators—two in the Senate, two in the House—to back Gov. Spencer Cox’s veto of a law that would bar transgender students from girls’ sports. Of the four GOP renegades, Mr. Thatcher was the only lawmaker up for re-election. While campaigning to be re-nominated from “a swing district that had become very, very red after recent redistricting,” he heard voter after voter tell him he’d lost their support for going soft on the transgender ban.<br />Mr. Thatcher, a devout Mormon, says he acted in accord with his faith: “I took the question to God. He gave me peace with doing the right thing.”"
