    "body": "A popular investment backed by the U.S. government recently became even more attractive, especially for tax-smart investors who are worried about inflation.<br />I wrote about the tax advantages and other aspects of Series I savings bonds in a column earlier this year. That column garnered a lot of follow-up questions from Wall Street Journal readers. The popularity of these investments is likely to continue with the U.S. Treasury announcing a few weeks ago that the initial annualized rate on new Series I savings bonds sold from May through October of this year is 9.62%."
