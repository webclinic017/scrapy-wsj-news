    "body": "After more than 10 months at work, Chile’s constitutional convention recently finished a draft of what it hopes will soon become the highest law in the land. The document removes the certainty of personal choice—including in healthcare, pensions and education—weakens property rights, increases the role of the state in the economy and moves the country away from representative democracy and toward mob rule.<br />To be promulgated, it must be approved by a majority of voters in a national referendum set for Sept. 4. Today that’s far from certain. Polls indicate that public sentiment for rejecting the draft constitution has climbed since late March. In a May 13 survey by the Chilean polling company Cadem, 46% of respondents said they plan to vote against the draft while 38% said they would vote in favor of it. Sixteen percent did not respond or were undecided."
