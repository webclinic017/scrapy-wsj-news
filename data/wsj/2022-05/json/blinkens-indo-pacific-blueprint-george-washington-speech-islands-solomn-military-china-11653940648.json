    "body": "Bangalore, India<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinken gave his long-awaited speech laying out the Biden administration’s China policy last week at George Washington University. It was a clear statement of American national strategy that will be closely read by foreign ministries and leaders around the world. Since 1945, Mr. Blinken said, America and its allies have built a global order that has to a large degree kept the peace and promoted the well-being of people around the world. The system needs to be modernized and reformed, but the defense of that system remains the cornerstone of President Biden’s foreign policy."
