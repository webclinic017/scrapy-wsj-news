    "body": "Elon Musk said Tuesday that he’d invite Donald Trump to return to  Twitter  if his acquisition of the social-media company succeeds, and good for him. Liberal Twitter is appalled, but we wonder if returning would help or hurt the former President.<br />Twitter banned Mr. Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, and the constant din of his media presence has since been muted. He communicates with emailed statements and occasional interviews with friendly journalists."
