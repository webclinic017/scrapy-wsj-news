    "body": "The counting of electoral votes after a presidential election was an uneventful ritual for generations: Congress would convene a joint session, tally the votes, and declare a winner. There weren’t meant to be any surprises; after all, the voters had already spoken.<br />Yet this process has become increasingly controversial over the past 20 years, never more so than on Jan. 6, 2021, when certain members of Congress objected to the votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania. Misleading interpretations of the law that governs the vote tally—the Electoral Count Act of 1887—swirled, leading some to demand that Vice President Mike Pence, whose role was simply to preside over the proceedings, reverse the results. Thankfully, Mr. Pence upheld the rule of law and performed his ministerial responsibility."
