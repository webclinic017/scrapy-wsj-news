    "body": "Stanley Goldfarb mischaracterizes Brigham and Women’s Hospital’s role in attempting to dismantle systemic racism within healthcare (“Keep Politics Out of the Doctor’s Office,” op-ed, April 19). We at Brigham are proud of our efforts to alleviate health disparities. We are not moving toward preferential care for any group or situation, but rather the opposite: delivering equitable care for everyone in an inclusive environment.<br />For example, we have eliminated the use of a race modifier in the calculation of kidney function that had the potential to disadvantage black patients from receiving timely nephrology care or transplantation. We also work to stratify all safety events based on socioeconomic variables to address issues driving inequitable care."
