    "body": "Toyota  finally has a product to compete with  Tesla .  Despite an awkward name and mixed reviews, the bZ4X could be the most consequential electric vehicle launched this year.<br />Toyota’s first pure battery model designed from the ground up is now arriving in showrooms around the world. Like Tesla’s Model Y,  Ford ’s  Mustang Mach-E and Hyundai’s Ioniq 5, the bZ4X is a compact sport-utility vehicle built on a rolling bed or “skateboard” of batteries. It was engineered with input from all-wheel-drive specialist Subaru, which this summer will launch a rival model called the Solterra."
