    "body": "Religious freedom promises that all our children can attend public schools without being pressured by teachers or coaches to join in someone else’s prayers. This keeps public schools a welcoming place for all families, regardless of religious belief. Most Americans take this basic constitutional protection for granted.<br />But the Supreme Court has decided to revisit this well-settled issue of law in a case called Kennedy v. Bremerton School District. As religious leaders of different faith traditions, we know this case could put the religious freedom rights of our communities’ children at risk—whether Christian or Jewish. We have even greater concern for children of yet smaller religious minority communities."
