    "body": "StraightPath Venture Partners LLC and the Securities and Exchange Commission have agreed to a resolution of the agency’s civil fraud charges against StraightPath and are working out details, including naming a receiver for the firm, a court document shows.<br />The agreement also includes the creation of an escrow account of more than $15 million to be supplied by three of the four individual defendants in the case, although a joint letter from the SEC and the Jupiter, Fla.-based firm dated May 26 doesn’t specify which of the four, Brian K. Martinsen, Michael A. Castillero, Francine A. Lanaia and Eric D. Lachow, would be responsible for providing the cash. But an earlier filing said Mr. Martinsen, Ms. Lanaia and Mr. Castillero “are prepared to place $15 million in escrow pending the outcome of this litigation.”"
