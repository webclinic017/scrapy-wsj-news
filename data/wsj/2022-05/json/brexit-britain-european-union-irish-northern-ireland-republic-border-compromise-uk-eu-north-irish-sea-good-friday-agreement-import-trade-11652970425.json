    "body": "Remember Brexit? Yes, that one. Readers outside the U.K.—including in Europe—might be surprised to discover it’s still an issue. Britons voted to leave the European Union in 2016. Two general elections and two prime ministers later, the departure formally occurred in early 2021. So why on earth has the issue exploded, again, this week?<br />The latest controversy concerns Northern Ireland, whose border with the Republic of Ireland constitutes the only land crossing between the European Union and the newly independent U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is threatening to tear up the part of Britain’s divorce settlement with the EU that governs trade between the British mainland and Northern Ireland, and between Northern Ireland and the rest of the EU—a move that would undermine the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which ended decades of sectarian violence."
