    "body": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell discussed why the central bank raised interest rates by a half percentage point, during a press conference after the Fed’s monetary policy meeting Wednesday. He said there is a broad sense among policy makers that they should consider more rate increases of a similar size, and that the U.S. economy is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy. He also discussed plans for the Fed to reduce the size of its $9 trillion balance sheet, stressing that doing so will play an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy. Here is a transcript of his comments.<br />JEROME H. POWELL: Good afternoon. It’s nice to see everyone in person for the first time in a couple years."
