    "body": "For an off-price retailer such as T.J. Maxx, which feeds on regular scraps of unsold inventory, 2021 was a famine year. A feast could be coming its way.<br />In normal times, such shops source their inventory through two broad buckets. About three-quarters is sourced through merchandise that local stores unload for a bargain (think of stores going out of business or piles of unsold clothes at the end of a season), while one-quarter is ordered directly from vendors and factories (primarily in Asia), according to estimates from Michael Binetti, equity analyst at Credit Suisse. Last year’s abnormally tight inventory situation flipped that ratio. In a research report, Credit Suisse estimated that so-called direct buy from factories or vendors accounted for as much as 75% of off-price inventory last year."
