    "body": "Banks all over the U.S. and around the world have curtailed lending to the U.S. oil-and-gas sector.  BOK Financial Corp.  has doubled down.<br />The Tulsa, Okla.-based bank holding company for the Bank of Albuquerque, Bank of Oklahoma and Bank of Texas, along with other financial-services companies, is majority-owned by billionaire oilman George Kaiser. It has been snatching market share from big European banks and local rivals that retreated from the industry even as oil prices leapt from historic lows to near-historic highs in less than two years."
