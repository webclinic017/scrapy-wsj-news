    "body": "Fourteen years after it was spun out from  Altria ,   Philip Morris International  wants to get back into the U.S. market—this time with a smoke-free business.<br />The tobacco giant, which distributes Marlboro cigarettes outside America, has made a $16 billion all-cash offer for Swedish Match, a Stockholm-based company that makes Zyn oral nicotine pouches. The price is a 39% premium to where the target’s shares were trading before the WSJ reported Monday that the two companies were in merger talks."
