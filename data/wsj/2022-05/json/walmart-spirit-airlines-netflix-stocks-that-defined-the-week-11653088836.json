    "body": "Walmart Inc.<br />Inflation is denting big-box retailers. Walmart said Tuesday that higher product, supply-chain and employee costs ate into its quarterly profit. The next day rival  Target Corp.  posted weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings and said it would rather absorb higher costs than raise prices on shoppers. Investors dumped shares of the retail giants after the disappointing results, as inflation holds close to its highest level in four decades. Walmart shares lost 11% Tuesday."
