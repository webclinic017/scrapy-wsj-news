    "body": "Helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression is clearly in the national interest of the U.S. So was opposing the flawed Ukraine aid package Congress passed last week. For saying so, the Heritage Foundation was accused by some on the right of abandoning conservative principles or embracing populist isolationism. Neither charge is true. But in one sense, both are welcome.<br />The war in Ukraine may finally force conservatives into the intramural foreign policy debate they have put off for more than 30 years. Heritage is committed to President Ronald Reagan’s belief in “peace through strength.” Today, conservatives differ over how to apply that maxim. Washington elites say we are divided into reckless neoconservatives and naive isolationists. In fact, conservative-minded Americans fall somewhere in between those two camps. But where most elected conservatives stand on the spectrum isn’t clear. The vote in Congress wasn’t for or against support of Ukraine. It was for or against an unpaid-for, unamendable, take-it-or-leave-it $40 billion omnibus proposal cobbled together outside the committee process."
