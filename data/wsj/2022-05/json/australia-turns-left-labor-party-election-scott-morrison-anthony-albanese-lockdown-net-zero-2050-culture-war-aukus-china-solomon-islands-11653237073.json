    "body": "Australia elected a Labor government for the first time in nearly a decade on Saturday, and the media are portraying it as a clarion call against climate change. The real lesson is that a ruling party that stands for little but a pale version of the opposition is likely to lose.<br />Australians can be forgiven for thinking little was at stake in this election because not much was. Scott Morrison, the defeated Prime Minister, had surrendered on climate last year by agreeing to the 2050 “net zero” carbon emissions goal of the global left. Labor leader Anthony Albanese, the new PM, campaigned on an end to the “climate wars,” but the Liberal-National Coalition had already conceded the principle. It all but abandoned the issue that had been crucial to its previous two election victories."
