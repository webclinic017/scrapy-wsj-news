    "body": "In “Democrats: When Do You Think Life Begins?” (op-ed, May 10), Florida Sen. Rick Scott purports to show scientifically that human life begins at conception. He lists various characteristics of embryos and fetuses at different stages of development, but he cites none at the time of conception or shortly thereafter.<br />At conception the fertilized egg is a single cell whose potential hasn’t been determined. It can become one individual person, but it can also become two or three or four."
