    "body": "If absence makes the heart grow fonder, “Top Gun” fans should be flying over the moon.<br />Paramount Pictures’ “Top Gun: Maverick” makes its debut next weekend almost exactly 36 years after the original movie first hit theaters. It also might be one of the most delayed movies of the pandemic era, having seen its release date move four times since April 2020. But the studio seems to have picked its final landing spot well; the domestic box office has hit about $2.3 billion so far this year, propelled by blockbusters like “The Batman” and “Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness”—both of which scored among the highest opening weekends of their respective franchises even when compared with prepandemic releases, according to Box Office Mojo."
