    "body": "Lest anyone think that William Galston’s column “Bill Clinton’s Recipe for Economic Growth” (Politics & Ideas, May 18) contains a complete listing of ingredients, there are a few others that should be added to the mix.<br />First, credit former President Clinton with realizing that the first two years of his administration were a failure and changes in personnel and direction were needed. A key change was the removal of Lloyd Bentsen as Treasury secretary. He was replaced by Robert Rubin, a savvy  Goldman Sachs  executive who proved to be an excellent secretary."
