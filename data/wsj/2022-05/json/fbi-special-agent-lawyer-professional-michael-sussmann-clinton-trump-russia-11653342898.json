    "body": "Thomas Baker faults former FBI directors Robert Mueller and James Comey for the “damage” they caused the bureau during their tenure (“The Sussmann Trial Is a Mueller Legacy,” op-ed, May 16). He also faults former FBI General Counsel James Baker, “a nonagent,” for not having a special agent present during his meeting with Michael Sussmann, an attorney with a law firm representing the Hillary Clinton campaign. “An agent would have known how to interview Mr. Sussmann,” he writes.<br />An agent should have been at the Sussmann interview, but I wonder if Mr. Baker would have been happy if either such experienced and senior special agents Andrew McCabe or Peter Strzok had been called to the meeting."
