    "body": "“Under the Banner of Heaven,” a Hulu series based on a real-life double murder committed in Utah, has been getting plenty of good press since its debut last week. But members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints aren’t impressed. Rather than “foster a better understanding of my faith tradition,” one LDS journalist recently lamented, the production is “yet one more mile marker in a decadeslong trail of angst.”<br />Early on, the show takes a dark view of the faith. And it depicts Mormons as bizarre, one-dimensional puppets—conversing in dialogue as foreign to members of the faith as to outsiders. Ominous tones overshadow even something as innocent as a father presenting his young daughter with a Choose the Right ring, the Mormon equivalent of a What Would Jesus Do? bracelet."
