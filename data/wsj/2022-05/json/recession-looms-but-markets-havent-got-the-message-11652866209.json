    "body": "After 28 trading days away from the markets*, I’ve come back to find that a new narrative of impending recession is quickly taking hold. Yet, look at the markets themselves and the story isn’t much reflected in asset prices, which are still beholden to the Federal Reserve. This creates both risks and opportunities.<br />Start with the good news, such as it is: Prices sensitive to monetary policy have fallen a lot. Really a lot. The bond most exposed to the value of money in the future, the 0.85% Austrian bond maturing in 2120, has lost 60% of what it was worth at its 2020 high. The equivalent bet in stock funds is Cathie Wood’s  ARK Innovation ETF ,  where profits for most of its holdings lie far in the future, and it is down more than 70% from its high."
