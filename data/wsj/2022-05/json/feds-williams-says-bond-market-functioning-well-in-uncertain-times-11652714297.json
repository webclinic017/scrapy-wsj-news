    "body": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York leader John Williams said Monday that bond market volatility doesn’t look problematic to him, in comments that reiterated his view that the central bank will need to forcefully tighten monetary policy to contain inflation.<br />The churn seen in government bonds over recent weeks is “more or less in line with” what one would expect to see given general uncertainty over the outlook and the shift in Fed policy, Mr. Williams said. “I’m not seeing signs of market dysfunction in the Treasury market,” he said."
