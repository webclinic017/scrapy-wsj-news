    "body": "When Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, nearly every international observer expected a Russian victory within days or at most a few weeks. The Ukrainians surprised us all. Anyone interested in foreign affairs has an opinion about the war, but how do Ukrainians feel? Thanks to an unprecedented effort from the International Republican Institute to conduct a nationwide poll of Ukraine during a time of war, we now know what its people think about the conflict, their leadership and the future of their country.<br />Several results stand out. First, President Volodymyr Zelensky commands a 94% approval rating. This is a striking turnaround for a leader who was previously seen as inexperienced and ineffective. After winning the election as a political novice with 73% of the vote, Mr. Zelenskyâ€™s public approval rating had fallen to only 25% last October. But in times of national emergency, true leaders rise to the occasion. He has excelled in the role of warrior-president and won the hearts of the people he was elected to serve."
