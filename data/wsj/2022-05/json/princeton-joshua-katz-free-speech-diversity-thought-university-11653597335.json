    "body": "The firing of Prof. Joshua Katz (“Princeton Fed Me to the Cancel Culture Mob,” op-ed, May 25) comes at a moment of growing awareness that the old Princeton may be gone and that conservative opinions may no longer be welcome on campus.<br />Sadly, there are many examples and one gets the feeling that the student body is fragile and protected from the rigor that comes from true debate or a genuine diversity of thought. The faculty and staff seem obsessively focused on woke issues like the renaming of buildings and current theories of equity rather than instilling grit and independent thought in the next generation."
