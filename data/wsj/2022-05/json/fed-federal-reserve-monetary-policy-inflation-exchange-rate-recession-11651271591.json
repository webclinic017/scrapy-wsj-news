    "body": "Joseph Sternberg uses the “soft landing” analogy (“Will the Mighty Dollar Prevent a Soft Landing From Inflation?” Political Economics, April 22) to discuss the predicament now faced by the Federal Reserve: how to slow inflation without creating chaos in the economy. This analogy brings to mind an airliner on a glide path to a specific airport, guided by precise instruments and pilots with spotless safety records.<br />The only challenge is to get the speed of descent right. Is it really that easy? Perhaps there is a better analogy for the Fed’s dilemma. Try to picture Chairman Jerome Powell driving the monetary-policy bus down a curvy road at excess speed. It’s foggy and visibility is poor. The steering is loose and the brakes only work with an unpredictable time lag. Various passengers, led by Neel Kashkari of the Minneapolis Fed, have been distracting the driver by insisting the fog is merely transitory while nattering about policies that have nothing to do with the task ahead. What could possibly go wrong?"
