    "body": "One measure of authoritarian “democracy” is when the winner takes nearly all of the vote. That’s the tale of John Lee’s victory this weekend as Hong Kong’s new chief executive.<br />Mr. Lee “was eventually elected with 99 per cent of the votes,” declared China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Officein a statement after the election. “This shows completely that Hong Kong highly recognises him.”"
