    "body": "Who is responsible for the value of the U.S. dollar? A cardinal rule among American practitioners of fiscal and monetary policy is that Treasury officials don’t discuss monetary policy and Federal Reserve authorities don’t discuss exchange rates. So who takes the blame—that is, which agency of government should be called on the carpet—when the currency fails to fulfill its basic functions?<br />As a store of value, a dollar that is losing significant purchasing power against goods and services because of inflation is failing the American people. As a unit of account, a dollar that transmits distorted price signals across borders because it is out of kilter with major foreign currencies plays havoc with international trade and investment outcomes. As a medium of exchange, a dollar that is widely accepted as a sovereign currency grants privileges, but private cryptocurrencies foreshadow a challenge."
