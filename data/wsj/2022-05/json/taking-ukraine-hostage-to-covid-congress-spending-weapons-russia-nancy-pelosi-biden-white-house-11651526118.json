    "body": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered a welcome show of support in Kyiv this weekend, promising President Volodymyr Zelensky that more military aid will soon be on the way. The test of that promise is whether Congress will act swiftly, or let the weapons get bogged down in a parochial fight over Covid-19 funding.<br />The Biden Administration has asked Congress for $33 billion for Ukraine, and more than $20 billion is for such military aid as artillery, air defenses and cyber support. Speedy delivery is crucial. The Russians are “at least several days behind where they wanted to be” in their new offensive, a U.S. defense official said late last week. But Russia’s highest-ranking uniformed officer reportedly visited the front, and count on the Russians picking up the scale and pace of their brutality."
