    "body": "Alan Patricof has no plans to move to Florida, and he does not want to play golf. “There’s too much retirement at 60 now,” says the pioneering venture capitalist, who launched his second fund, Greycroft, when he was 72 and his third, Primetime Partners, in 2020 when he was 85. Now 87, he is out most nights, takes long bicycle rides on weekends in the Hamptons and plans to run—or walk—his sixth New York City Marathon this fall. “I don’t know how to sit and do nothing,” he says over video from his Manhattan home. “There are possibilities in every time of life.”<br />As he writes in his new memoir, “No Red Lights,” published this week, Mr. Patricof’s interest in meaningful longevity moved him to start Primetime, a $50 million venture fund for the over-60 market. “Listen, this is the fastest growing part of the population, so we’ve got to figure out how to keep these people active, motivated, interested and entertained,” he says."
