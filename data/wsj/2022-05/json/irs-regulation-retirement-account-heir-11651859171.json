    "body": "Proposed new regulations from the Internal Revenue Service for inherited retirement accounts would require many heirs to make minimum annual withdrawals from the accountsâ€”leaving less room for the savings to grow tax-deferred over the years.<br />The new rules would provide guidance to the Secure Act of 2019, which made several changes to laws governing retirement accounts."
