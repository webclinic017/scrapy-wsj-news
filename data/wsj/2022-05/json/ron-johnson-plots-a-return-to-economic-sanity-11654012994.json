    "body": "Dan Henninger asks Republicans to let voters know how to build a stable economic future from “Biden’s Train-Wreck Economy” (Wonder Land, May 26). I’m happy to start talking.<br />It starts with safety and security. We must secure our border and dramatically reduce the flow of illegal immigration by reinstating consequences for illegal entry. The credible-fear standard, which has caused “catch and release” and the massive increase in illegal entries, must be raised closer to the stricter asylum requirements. Asylum claims must be adjudicated rapidly and definitively. Once we control our border, we should establish a legal immigration system that can provide the workers our economy needs without depressing wages."
