    "body": "Tyler Goodspeed and Kevin Hassett’s op-ed “The 2017 Tax Reform Delivered as Promised” (May 9) paints an incomplete picture of the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). I have worked hard to understand the act’s effects, conducting my own research and cataloging others’.<br />The research suggests a complicated picture. There are great outcomes of the TCJA. But it’s hard to attribute increases in wages or investment, for example, solely to the tax reform. The law was expansive, and other contemporaneous and confounding events (trade wars, for instance) make it difficult to tease out its effects. The biggest piece of the TCJA affected all companies all at once, all at the same time, resulting in a natural experiment that provides no natural counterfactual."
