    "body": "I couldn’t agree more that “Biden’s Real Taiwan Mistake” (Review & Outlook, May 24) was not to invite Taiwan to launch the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF). Situated in the middle of the first-island chain in the West Pacific, where the U.S. has strong strategic and security interests, Taiwan is an indispensable partner.<br />Economically, it is a high-tech hub; Taiwan manufactures 92% of global supply of the advanced logic chips essential for end users in AI and 5G, and many of them have military applications. The disruption of supply chains caused by the shortage of chips for the auto industry, which affected the jobs of millions of U.S. workers, crystallizes the importance of Taiwan’s role. Bringing Taiwan to the IPEF will enhance the resilience of the global supply chain, secure America’s supply of strategic components and create jobs for U.S. workers."
