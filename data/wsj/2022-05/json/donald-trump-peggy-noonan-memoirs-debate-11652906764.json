    "body": "Regarding “Trump and Biden or Lincoln and Douglas?” (Declarations, May 14): You have to love that Peggy Noonan proposes 21 hours of formal debate about former President Donald Trump and progressives without allowing Mr. Trump to speak. Will that really get through to the people who support Mr. Trump? They are more likely to believe that they have been chained to their chairs for a 21-hour re-education session. And isn’t that exactly what Washington and the media would like to provide them, if they aren’t already?<br />Gilbert Sandgren"
