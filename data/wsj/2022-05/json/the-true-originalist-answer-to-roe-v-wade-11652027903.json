    "body": "Regarding David Garrow’s op-ed “Justice Alito’s Originalist Triumph” (May 5): Justice Samuel Alito’s leaked draft opinion relies on the post-1937 New Deal idea that all social and economic matters are subject to the rational-basis test. He thus conserves New Deal constitutionalism and Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes’s dissent in Lochner v. New York (1905), not the original meaning of the 14th Amendment in 1868.<br />A true originalist ruling overturning Roe v. Wade (1973) would say that abortion is not a privilege or immunity of citizenship because it is not deeply rooted in American tradition or in the concept of ordered liberty, as is required by Corfield v. Coryell (1823), the case that the framers of the 14th Amendment said interpreted its most important clause: the Privileges or Immunities Clause."
