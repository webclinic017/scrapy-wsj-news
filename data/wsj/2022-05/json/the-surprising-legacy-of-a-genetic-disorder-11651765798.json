    "body": "Genetic diseases like sickle cell anemia or cystic fibrosis occur when a section of a chromosome or a single gene is defective or missing, and their effects are unmistakable. But in recent years researchers have found that other genetic conditions are more subtle, affecting things like temper and the ability to learn, which are often thought of as simply part of an individual’s personality. Even more surprising, researchers are starting to understand how these traits can appear in carriers of a genetic disease who don’t have the full-blown disease themselves.<br />That was the case for Carol, now in her 70s. (I have changed her name and those of her family members to protect their privacy.) For most of her life, she assumed that everything wrong with her family was just the way families were. Growing up in a Chicago suburb in the 1950s, she was scorned by her father, Lewis, who expressed his contempt for her and his wife in one blow: “You’re stupid like your mother.” When Carol grew up and had children of her own, her daughter Amy was introverted and a poor student. Counselors at school told Carol that Amy’s problem was that she couldn’t measure up to her mother’s expectations."
