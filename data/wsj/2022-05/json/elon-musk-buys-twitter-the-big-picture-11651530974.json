    "body": "<br />Social media giant  Twitter  jolted the social-media world last week by agreeing to sell itself to entrepreneur and self-described “free-speech absolutist” Elon Musk for $44 billion. The  Tesla  chief executive has indicated a desire to loosen the site’s content moderation policies, which some see as unduly targeting conservatives, and unlock value that the company’s current leadership can’t. The Opinion pages of The Wall Street Journal look at how the deal came about, why it matters, and how it might change the way we communicate online."
