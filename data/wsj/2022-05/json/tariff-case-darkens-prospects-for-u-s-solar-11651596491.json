    "body": "Between raw material inflation, delayed deliveries and slow permitting, the U.S. solar industry was already starting the year with some speed bumps. Now, a tariff case has brought the industry to a halt.<br />On Sunday, a group of senators sent a letter to President Biden asking to speed up a solar tariff case that has prompted outcries from the industry. In late March, the Commerce Department started an investigation into whether Chinese solar producers are illegally circumventing solar tariffs by routing their operations through Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia. The four countries made up at least 80% of U.S. solar imports in 2020, and because the vast majority of manufacturers in those countries are Chinese companies, the ruling would affect only slightly less than that percentage, according to Pol Lezcano, solar analyst at BloombergNEF. The trigger was a request from Auxin Solar, a small solar manufacturer based in California."
