    "body": "Chinese internet stocks jumped, after results from  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd. and  Baidu Inc.  came in ahead of the marketâ€™s downbeat expectations.<br />The rally, which extended a period of extraordinary volatility for the sector, began in the U.S., where American depositary receipts in both companies leapt by more than 10% Thursday. That helped fuel a 7.6% advance in the broader Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index."
