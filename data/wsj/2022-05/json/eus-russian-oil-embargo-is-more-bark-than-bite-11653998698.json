    "body": "The European Union’s partial embargo on Russian oil carries more weight politically than economically. Targeting tankers or insurance would be much more disruptive to the market.<br />After weeks of political wrangling, all 27 countries in the bloc finally agreed to ban Russian crude purchases overnight on Monday. Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban—an EU bugbear and pal of Russian President Vladimir Putin—had been the holdout. The phased-in embargo is forecast to affect about 90% of the bloc’s total Russian crude imports by the end of the year, with Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic expected to use an exemption for pipeline supplies."
