    "body": "JPMorgan  Chase has told the market what it needed to hear.<br />After holding steady with its forecast for net interest income when it released first-quarter earnings last month, even as the Federal Reserve became increasingly hawkish, the bank during an Investor Day presentation on Monday raised that target to $56 billion-plus for 2022, excluding its volatile markets unit. It also sees a path, based on what it anticipates for the fourth quarter, to a future annual rate of around $66 billion."
