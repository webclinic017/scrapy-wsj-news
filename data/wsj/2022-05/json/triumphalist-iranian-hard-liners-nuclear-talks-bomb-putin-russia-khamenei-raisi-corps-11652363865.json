    "body": "The European Union’s envoy charged with reviving Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic, Enrique Mora, was in Tehran Wednesday in another—some call it last-ditch—effort to get the clerical regime to come to terms.<br />During the past 16 months of negotiations—many of them “proximity talks,” with negotiators in separate rooms—Washington reportedly granted Tehran numerous technical accommodations and massive sanctions relief. The two sides apparently overcame Vladimir Putin’s 11th-hour effort to use such relief as a means to void sanctions against Russia. Washington and Tehran likely have agreed, as they did in 2015, to ignore the International Atomic Energy Agency’s questions about Iran’s undeclared manipulated uranium—a prerequisite for a bomb."
