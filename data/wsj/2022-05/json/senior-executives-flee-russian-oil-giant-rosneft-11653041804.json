    "body": "Russian state oil giant  Rosneft Oil Co .  is shedding senior executives, a brain drain that stands to weaken a prime driver of the country’s economy while Moscow wages war on Ukraine.<br />Chief Executive Igor Sechin’s two top lieutenants, first vice presidents Didier Casimiro and Zeljko Runje, are leaving the company, people familiar with the departures said. Their exit means Mr. Sechin, a longtime associate of President Vladimir Putin, will have to navigate a crisis in Russian oil markets without his most experienced deputies."
