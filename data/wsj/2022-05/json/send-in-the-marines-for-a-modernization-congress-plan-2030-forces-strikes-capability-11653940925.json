    "body": "On paper the Russians have every advantage. A million more soldiers in uniform, more than 10 times the military budget, 10 times the aircraft, six times the tanks. But a much smaller Ukrainian force resolutely repelled Russia’s attack on and around Kyiv and it continues to stymie Russian forces with small infantry units equipped with modern weapons, the latest training, the best intelligence and the courage of troops fighting for freedom.<br />Most commentators have been surprised, but Ukraine’s successful principles are the same as those in the U.S. Marine Corps’ plan to modernize. The Marines understand something the Kremlin did not: In the face of technological change, the future of warfare won’t be like its past."
