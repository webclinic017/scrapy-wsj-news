    "body": "The slightly daunting, furrowed-brow title of Samuel D. Hunter’s new play, “A Case for the Existence of God,” might alarm theatergoers uninterested in a fraught theological debate. (Which would be most of them—er, us.) But Mr. Hunter, one of the finest playwrights at work today, is anything but an ideologue. His subject is the complexities of specific human beings—appealingly unexceptional ones—and the trials, large and small, that life throws their way. Mr. Hunter’s plays are notable, or rather remarkable, for their laid-back simplicity and the depth of the compassion he shows for his characters.<br />Both are on exemplary view in this play, easily one of the best of the year. It largely takes place in the cramped office of Keith (Kyle Beltran), a mortgage broker in Twin Falls, Idaho, who is meeting with a new client, Ryan (Will Brill). They ran into each other at a day-care facility attended by both their girls, who are under 2 years old."
