    "body": "A proposal from California Democrats to institute a statewide four-day workweek for hourly employees has been shelved, for now.<br />The bill failed to advance after the California State Assembly’s Labor and Employment Committee declined to set it for a policy hearing, said Evan Low, the Democratic state assembly member who co-wrote the proposed legislation. That decision effectively ends the bill’s chances of progressing in the current legislative session, he said."
