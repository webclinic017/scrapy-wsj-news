    "body": "In “The Welcome Pushback Against Politicized Investment Managers” (op-ed, May 20), C. Boyden Gray and Jonathan Berry suggest asset managers like  BlackRock  and our competitors “push political agendas.”<br />That’s not true. Special interests may apply a political lens to our thousands of annual proxy votes. But we cast votes based only on the long-term economic interests of the millions of people whose money we manage. If our proxy-voting record exhibits a bias, it is toward greater disclosure, which we believe makes markets more efficient, which in turn benefits our clients."
