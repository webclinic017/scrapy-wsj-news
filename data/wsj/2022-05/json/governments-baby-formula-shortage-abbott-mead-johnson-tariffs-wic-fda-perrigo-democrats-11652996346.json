    "body": "Politicians are scrambling to pacify mothers angry about the baby formula shortage, but the one thing they won’t do is look in the mirror. Fixing the shortage requires fixing the government policies that helped to create it.<br />The shortage began after  Abbott Laboratories  shut down a plant in Michigan after four infants who consumed formula made at the facility fell seriously ill. Abbott controls about 42% of the U.S. market, and the other three large manufacturers (Perrigo,  Nestle  and Mead Johnson) haven’t been able to increase production fast enough to compensate. Ergo, empty shelves."
