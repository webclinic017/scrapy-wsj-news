    "body": "Justice Samuel Alito’s draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization represents the auspicious culmination of the conservative legal movement, which has fundamentally transformed U.S. constitutional interpretation over the past quarter-century.<br />Justice Alito’s opinion is also a posthumous triumph for William H. Rehnquist, who dissented from Roe v. Wade as an associate justice in 1973 and who as chief justice in 1997 successfully undermined the constitutional foundation of Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In that splintered 1992 ruling, three Republican-appointed justices—Sandra Day O’Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter—had surprisingly reaffirmed Roe’s protection of a right to abortion."
