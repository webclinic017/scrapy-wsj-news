    "body": "The solution to the student debt problem is not to forgive the six-figure debt that many elite colleges pile on their students (“The Taxpayer Con of the Century,” Review & Outlook, April 30). The solution is to prevent that level of debt from accumulating in the first place. Since government is now the largest dispenser of tuition funds, it should simply refuse to pay the high tuitions that these colleges charge. That’s what it did with Medicare. It reset reimbursements at a lower level. Hospitals had to readjust; some closed and others trimmed the fat and got by on the lower payments. Let colleges do the same.<br />Keith Stamler"
