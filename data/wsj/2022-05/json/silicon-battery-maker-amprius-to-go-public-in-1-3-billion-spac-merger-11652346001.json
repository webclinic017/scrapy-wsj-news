    "body": "Amprius Technologies Inc. has reached a deal with a special-purpose acquisition company that values the maker of silicon-anode batteries at about $1.3 billion and would take it public, company officials said.<br />Based in Fremont, Calif., Amprius makes batteries that it says are more powerful than conventional lithium-ion cells because they use energy-dense silicon in the batteryâ€™s anode instead of graphite, the traditional material. The company currently sells them to customers such as  Airbus  SE and the U.S. Army to power electric aircraft and drones and says they can also be used for electric cars."
