    "body": "Say what you will about the current Supreme Court, and many critics are never happy, but the Roberts Court has been sonorous on religious liberty. The Justices provided another bell-ringer Monday in a 9-0 decision.<br />Hundreds of times, the city of Boston has let private groups hoist their flags for a few hours in the square outside City Hall. It denied zero requests until it refused an applicant asking to fly a Christian flag with a cross. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld its denial, saying Boston “engages in government speech when it raises a third-party flag,” and lifting a Christian banner “could signal the City’s embrace of that religion.”"
