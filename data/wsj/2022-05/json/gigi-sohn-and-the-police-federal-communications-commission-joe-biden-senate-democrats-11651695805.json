    "body": "Three Elizabeth Warren acolytes appointed by President Biden have failed to win confirmation in the Senate, and now the White House is scrambling to save another. But the President may be endangering vulnerable Senate Democrats by continuing to push Gigi Sohn for the Federal Communications Commission.<br />We’ve described the many reasons Ms. Sohn shouldn’t be confirmed. She supports heavy-handed broadband regulation, including reimposing the Obama Title II “net-neutrality” rules. She wants to regulate broadband as Europe does, which would stifle investment. Some 92% of Americans have access to uber-high speed fixed broadband compared to 67% of Europeans."
