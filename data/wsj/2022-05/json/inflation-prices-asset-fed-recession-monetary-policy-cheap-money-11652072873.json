    "body": "Alan Blinder argues, “If We Get a Recession Soon, It’ll Be a Mild One” (op-ed, April 29) because policy makers are shooting for a soft landing. But adjusting monetary policy to a specific economic outcome isn’t easy. There would never be any recessions or housing bubbles if it were.<br />Monetary policy has taken an overly accommodative stance for more than a decade. The Fed’s promises that money will remain cheap have resulted in enormous leverage. The economy will have a hard time adjusting to a world without cheap money."
