    "body": "Scott Kaufmann’s letter (April 23) is too quick to compare the average homeowner with Warren Buffett. Buying a home in an area where you plan to live long term keeps folks out of trouble. Houses can also be bought with 10% down. Or even 3%. After a few years, the mortgage is no more than a comparable rent, and then lower every year after that. And if you sell? Tax-free profits from the house.<br />My parents bought a house in 1984 for $325,000 with 10% down. It has more than quadrupled in value. Yes, the S&P 500 is up 2200% since then. But since the subsequent expenses were no more than rent, the profits on the small down payment are approximately 45 times, or double the S&P return. Perhaps dividends bring the relative profits closely into line."
