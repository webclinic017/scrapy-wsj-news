    "body": "The United Kingdom on Wednesday reported its highest inflation rate since 1982, and welcome to the 40-Year Club alongside the U.S. A new generation on both sides of the Atlantic is learning how erratic price swings can wreck an economy. And in that spirit, a brief research note from a London think tank is worth a closer look.<br />The official British consumer-price inflation rate out this week is 9% in April, but not everyone is suffering equally. For the first time in this inflationary cycle, the poorest British households are experiencing the largest price increases, according to calculations from the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The 30% of households with the lowest incomes saw the prices they pay rise by at least 9.7%, and as high as 10.9%. The top 10% of earners saw their prices rise by “only” 7.9%."
