    "body": "Harsh lockdowns in Shanghai and elsewhere in China have ended illusions that the Communist Party has managed the Covid-19 pandemic well. Yet Beijing is still trying to run the World Health Organization.<br />The World Health Assembly, the WHO’s decision-making body, will hold its 75th annual meeting in Geneva on May 22-28. Beijing has prevented Taiwan from attending the assembly since 2017, and it now seeks to exclude it for another year. China doesn’t recognize Taiwan’s legitimacy and works to bar the island democracy from any global forum."
