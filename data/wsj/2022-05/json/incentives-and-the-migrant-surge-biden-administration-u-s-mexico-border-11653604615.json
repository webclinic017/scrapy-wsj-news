    "body": "Migrants keep coming over the U.S.-Mexico border in record numbers, and it turns out the Biden Administration is well aware that the incentive provided by its immigration policies is one of the reasons.<br />That’s the news in a report by the Axios website Wednesday that the planned repeal of a border-enforcement policy spurred as many as 50,000 migrants to prepare to cross into the U.S. from Mexico this week. The migrants know that the Biden Administration plans to repeal Title 42, which has been the government’s main tool for turning away asylum claimants for the past two years. A federal judge last week halted the repeal, but the Justice Department plans to appeal."
