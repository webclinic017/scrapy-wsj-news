    "body": "Porsche  was more profitable than ever in the first quarter. Investors will have to wait until the fall for its initial public offering, but there are indirect ways to get in early.<br />Volkswagen ,  which has controlled the sports-car brand since 2012, reported full quarterly results Wednesday. Headline numbers prereleased last month were boosted by big hedging gains. Nickel’s wild ride on the London Metal Exchange was likely the dominant driver, given VW’s investments in the supply chain for electric vehicles, but Chief Financial Officer Arno Antlitz declined to give details on a media call Wednesday “for competitive reasons.”"
