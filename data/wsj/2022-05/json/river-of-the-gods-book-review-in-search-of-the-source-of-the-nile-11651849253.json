    "body": "Candice Millard is drawn to the rivers that challenged the outsiders who tried to explore them. The backdrop of her fine 2005 book, “River of Doubt,” is a tributary of the Aripuaña River in Brazil. In “River of the Gods,” she surveys the “genius, courage, and betrayal” involved “in the search for the source of the Nile.”<br />As a consequence of the struggle between the French and British over who would dominate Egypt in the 18th and 19th centuries, especially after the decipherment of the Rosetta Stone’s hieroglyphics in 1822, “Europe’s fascination with Egyptian history and the Nile Valley,” Ms. Millard writes, “had grown into a full-scale frenzy.” One result was a lust to discover the source of that mythic body of water. Indeed, such an objective was the “Holy Grail of exploration.” (Specifically, Ms. Millard’s book is about one of the river’s branches, the White Nile.)"
