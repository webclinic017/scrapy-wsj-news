    "body": "The shrinking Colorado River is only the beginning of what will be a major global shortage of fresh water in the next decades (“Shrinking Colorado River Starts to Trim Arizona’s Water Supply,” U.S. News, April 25). Despite our efforts at carbon reduction, warming oceans and atmosphere will continue due to the accumulated energy in the ecosystem, allowing the atmosphere to hold more water, resulting in less rainfall. When it does rain, it will tend to be torrential, resulting in flooding that we aren’t equipped to capture in reservoirs or aquifers. The real challenge is the development of massive desalination capacity to refill reservoirs and aquifers, combined with new infrastructure to capture and transport torrential rainfall.<br />Larry Isacson"
