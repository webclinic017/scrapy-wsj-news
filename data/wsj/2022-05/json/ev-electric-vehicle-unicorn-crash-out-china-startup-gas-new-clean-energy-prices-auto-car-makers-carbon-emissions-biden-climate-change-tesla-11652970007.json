    "body": "A parade of electric-vehicle startups have gone public in recent years and commanded multibillion-dollar valuations—Rivian,  Nikola ,   Canoo ,  Lordstown,  Fisker ,   Workhorse Group ,   Mullen Automotive  and  Lucid .  Most had never sold a single car at their public debut. Fueled by cheap credit and political subsidies, their stocks surged, only to crash. Their ambitions were ahead of reality.<br />The same is true of Democrats who want to replace gasoline-powered cars with supposedly climate-friendly electric vehicles. Consider the problems now befalling China, the world leader in electric-vehicle production and exports. Beijing has set aggressive production quotas for car makers and provided generous subsidies for buyers. China’s annual electric-vehicle production capacity has ballooned to 5.7 million vehicles—for comparison, 434,879 electric vehicles were sold in the U.S. last year—and is expected to hit 15 million in a couple of years."
