    "body": "The press predicted a surge of Big Labor victories after an Amazon warehouse unionized last month, but the labor “tidal wave” has yet to claim a single island. A separate vote this week shows that unions still face long odds in organizing at Amazon and other private employers.<br />The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) said Monday that employees at Amazon’s LDJ5 warehouse had rejected a union. The package-sorting center is on Staten Island—about a four-minute drive from Amazon’s JFK8 facility, which made a national splash when its workers approved a union last month. Employees at LDJ5 rejected the union by a vote of 62% to 38%."
