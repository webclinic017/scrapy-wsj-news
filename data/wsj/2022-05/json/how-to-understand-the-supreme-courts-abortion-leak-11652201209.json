    "body": "Regarding your editorial “The Supreme Court Leak” (May 4): In his majority opinion in Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action (2014), Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote, “It is demeaning to the democratic process to presume that the voters are not capable of deciding an issue of this sensitivity on decent and rational grounds.”<br />Justice Kennedy failed to apply his own standard in Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992). According to Evan Thomas’s book “First: Sandra Day O’Connor,” Justice Kennedy was one of five justices who initially voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, but Justices O’Connor and David Souter were “able to persuade Kennedy to change his initial vote in conference, from overturning Roe to sustaining it.”"
