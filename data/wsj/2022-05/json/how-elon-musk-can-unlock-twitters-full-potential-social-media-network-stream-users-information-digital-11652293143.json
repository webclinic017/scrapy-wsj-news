    "body": "The world is speculating about where Elon Musk will take  Twitter .  It’s an important question, because the social network has the potential to do vastly more than it does now. Today Twitter is like Hoover Dam, with all its raging power put to use lighting one 40-watt bulb. But with a few fairly small changes, Twitter would stand a decent chance of becoming the basic interface between users and all their digital information. As such, it would help the American software industry retain its standing as the world leader.<br />In 1994 Eric Freeman and I invented the Twitter-type stream, called a Lifestream. On your computer, a Lifestream looks like a single file of playing cards receding into the depth of the screen. The idea is to combine all your digital possessions—documents, photos, videos, bookmarks, etc.—with all your email and the whole of your digital future, insofar as you know it. The future holds approaching appointments and events, work to do later, commercial information and so on. Each of these items corresponds to one card."
