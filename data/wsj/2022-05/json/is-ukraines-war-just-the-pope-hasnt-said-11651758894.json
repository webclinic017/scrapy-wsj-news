    "body": "Since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, Pope Francis has made clear that he condemns the “violent aggression against Ukraine” and sympathizes with “victims whose innocent blood cries out to heaven.”<br />But the pope has also raised questions about whether he thinks the Ukrainians have a right to defend themselves through the use of arms. He has on several occasions said that weapons aren’t the solution to the war; called it madness for countries to increase their military spending in response to Russia’s aggression; and spoken against the increased use of sanctions in response to the invasion. He has twice cited Mahatma Gandhi’s advocacy of nonviolent resistance, and said emphatically that there is no such thing as a “just war.”"
