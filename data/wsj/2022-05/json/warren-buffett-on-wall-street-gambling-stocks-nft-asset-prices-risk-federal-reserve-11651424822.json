    "body": "Warren Buffett is apparently shocked, shocked to find gambling going on in financial markets. That was the headline from the  Berkshire Hathaway  CEO’s remarks at its annual meeting on Saturday in Omaha. “It’s a gambling parlor,” Mr. Buffett said, and he blamed the financial industry for encouraging risky and speculative behavior.<br />His longtime business partner, Charlie Munger, underscored the lament. “I don’t think we ever had anything quite like we have now in terms of the volumes of pure gambling activity going on daily,” he said. “It’s not pretty.” At 98 years old, Mr. Munger has seen just about everything in markets—good, bad and ugly."
