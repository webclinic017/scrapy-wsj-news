    "body": "Allstate Corp.  reported a 61% decline in its closely watched adjusted net income compared with last year, as the U.S. car-insurance industry grapples with growing accident volumes and sharply higher claims costs.<br />Another of the biggest and best-known publicly traded insurers,  MetLife Inc . , also reported lower adjusted earnings, as it calls its measure of operating income to exclude items judged nonrecurring. The company cited lower investment income from nontraditional investments, offset partially by a decline in death claims tied to the Covid-19 pandemic."
