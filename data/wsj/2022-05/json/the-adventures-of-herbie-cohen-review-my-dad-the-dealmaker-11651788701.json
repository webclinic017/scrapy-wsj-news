    "body": "Dutiful sons often revere their fathers for their instruction in the ways of the world—by direction and indirection, sterling example and train wreck. I cherish my father’s simple credos: “People are funny” (they can be full of grace or something else), “You get nothing for nothing” (seek true value, not bargains), and “Put a smile on your face, boy!” (face the world with confidence).<br />The prolific author Rich Cohen’s father, Herb, offered him far more—a lifetime seminar in how to outfox opponents in the great game of life by out-thinking, out-flanking, out-empathizing and thereby out-negotiating them. In his treat of a new book, “The Adventures of Herbie Cohen: World’s Greatest Negotiator,” proud son Rich portrays his dad as the Aristotle of hustle. Or, as the writer has it, a “Jewish Buddha.”"
