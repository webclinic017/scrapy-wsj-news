    "body": "Over the past year Joe Biden and his political allies have tried to persuade voters that inflation is the result of a surge in greed that somehow happens to coincide with his presidency. But the overriding theme of the Biden era is fear, which is what happens to societies when something as fundamental as the value of the currency is allowed to deteriorate.<br />Price instability and scarcity are deeply concerning to those who remember the 1970s, and perhaps even scarier for young people who had never experienced them until now. But the signals of worry are not just coming from the financial markets."
