    "body": "Public concern about illegal immigration continues to dog the White House. An ABC News poll released last month put support for President Biden’s handling of the issue at just 37%. The worry, moreover, is bipartisan and rising fastest among Democrats, yet the administration pretends that the only people who care about border security are racist conservatives.<br />On Friday, Judge Robert Summerhays of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana issued an injunction that barred the administration from lifting restrictions that prevent migrants apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border from seeking asylum. The provisions, known as Title 42, were adopted by the Trump administration during the pandemic to curb the spread of Covid-19. The Biden administration wants to end them, but two dozen states sued the government to keep them in place. The White House says the health threat has subsided due to the availability of vaccines, and perhaps it has. But it’s also true that the threat of illegal immigrants overwhelming the border is higher than it’s been in decades. In the short term, states and localities bear the associated economic costs."
