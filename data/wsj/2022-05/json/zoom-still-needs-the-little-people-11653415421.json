    "body": "The ironic challenge facing  Zoom Video Communications  is how to wean itself off the very customers that made it a household name.<br />Fiscal first-quarter results from the videoconferencing provider on Monday afternoon showed progress on that front. Revenue from enterprise customers jumped 31% year over year and now comprise a little over half its business on a quarterly basis. That well outpaced the company’s total revenue growth of 12% for the quarter."
