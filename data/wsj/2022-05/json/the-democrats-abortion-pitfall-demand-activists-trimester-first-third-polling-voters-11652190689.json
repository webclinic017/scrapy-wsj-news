    "body": "The distinct possibility that the Supreme Court will overturn Roe v. Wade outright has triggered—predictably—a polarized debate that is out of step with the views of most Americans. Both political parties can go too far and—if past is prologue—probably will. Democrats hope to make gains on this issue but could forfeit them if they yield to pressure from activist groups.<br />Let’s start with the top-line figures. Public opinion on Roe hasn’t budged in the past quarter-century: A solid but not overwhelming majority support the decision, while a staunch minority oppose it. Not surprisingly, recent polls show that a majority of Americans oppose overturning the decision."
