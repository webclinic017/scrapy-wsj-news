    "body": "Mary Vought astutely explained the “absurdity” of House Democrats’ plan to authorize collective bargaining for congressional staffers (“Nancy Pelosi’s Unionization Folly,” op-ed, May 10). Still, at least by passing the resolution, which the House did last week along party lines, Democrats are on the record supporting secret-ballot unionization elections.<br />Big Labor’s legislative priority remains the Protecting the Right to Organize Act. The PRO Act is a wish list focused on boosting union membership by undermining employees’ right to vote on unionization in secret-ballot elections, such as have been recently occurring at Amazon facilities and Starbucks branches around the country."
