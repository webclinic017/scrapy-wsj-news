    "body": "In “Public Prayer Doesn’t Belong in Public Schools” (op-ed, May 11), Rabbi David Saperstein and Bishop Teresa Jefferson-Snorton make a persuasive argument that even at a football game, where no one is forced to play or attend, having a coach walk to the middle of the field after the game and kneel down to pray could create a hostile environment and put pressure on players “to join in someone else’s prayers.”<br />The same argument can be made about freedom of speech, which can put pressure on those who hear it, make them feel uncomfortable or deny them their “safe space.” But the First Amendment does not guarantee freedom from religion or freedom from disagreeable speech. It bans Congress from “prohibiting the free exercise” of religion “or abridging the freedom of speech.” Part of living in a free society is tolerating people who may pray in ways you don’t agree with or speak in ways you may find hateful. That is the price of freedom. The cost of banning prayer and speech for some is ending freedom for all."
