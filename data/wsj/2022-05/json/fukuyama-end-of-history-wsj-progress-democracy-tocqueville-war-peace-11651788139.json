    "body": "Regarding Francis Fukuyama’s “The Long Arc of Historical Progress” (Review, April 30): First, human nature hasn’t evolved one iota. It is a mixed nature, part animal and part rational, and the rational has only a very tenuous control over the passionate. It is a credit to long-established laws and institutions that human beings have come together to form relatively peaceful and productive nation-states. We haven’t become better.<br />Second, the progress of nation-states must be viewed in the context of the international order. It is a Hobbesian order with no overarching power to create or enforce law. The equilibria that arise from efforts to balance opportunities and threats are unstable and require great skill and cost to maintain. It isn’t destined that liberal nations win or even survive the inherent anarchy of the current order."
