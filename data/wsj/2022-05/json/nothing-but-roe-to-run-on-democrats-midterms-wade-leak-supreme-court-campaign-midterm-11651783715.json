    "body": "Democrats this week seized on the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion on abortion as a new political lifeline for the midterm elections, looking to channel outrage into electoral success. Put another way, they are going down the same road that landed them here in the first place.<br />The liberal response to Justice Samuel Alitoâ€™s draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade was as predictable as it was substance-free. Forget any discussion about the legal reasoning in the case. Or any soul-searching as to how Democrats came to face a 6-3 conservative high-court majority. Or any internal debate about how the party might craft an agenda that resonates with the public, so that it can maintain its hold on power and begin the process of reshaping the court."
