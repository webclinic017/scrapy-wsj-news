    "body": "One promising development of the Ukraine crisis has been the decision by several members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to increase commitments to the alliance’s defense needs. But even if all NATO members meet the charter’s threshold of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense, many would remain vulnerable given the leverage of Russia’s energy resources. The best way to improve defense capabilities is to secure alternative energy supplies for NATO members.<br />An emergency in one region can also reveal the value of partners in another. Since last July’s troubling Afghanistan exit, the Biden administration has struggled to land a signature foreign-policy win in the Middle East. President Biden did, however, upgrade one key strategic relationship with a critical ally in the Gulf: Qatar. This was an important reordering of America’s hierarchy of allies that could form a solution to Europe’s dependence on Russian energy. American and Qatari liquefied natural gas supplies can lessen Western dependence on Russian exports, and Qatar seems to be a willing and reliable partner."
