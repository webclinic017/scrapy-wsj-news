    "body": "A number of recent polls have suggested that voters aren’t particularly enamored of the Supreme Court, nor with its draft opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade, which was recently leaked to Politico. But that doesn’t necessarily mean Americans want to change the judiciary. The encouraging findings from a new Mason-Dixon poll suggest that U.S. registered voters—including a large majority of independents—want the Court to continue under its current structure, but without any more leaks of draft opinions.<br />The survey of 1,100 registered voters was commissioned by the First Liberty Institute and conducted from May 13 through May 18. This column will offer the usual disclaimer that public opinion polling is not an exact science, if it’s even a science. But Mason-Dixon tends to be among  the most accurate pollsters, receiving an A- grade from the survey website FiveThirtyEight.com"
