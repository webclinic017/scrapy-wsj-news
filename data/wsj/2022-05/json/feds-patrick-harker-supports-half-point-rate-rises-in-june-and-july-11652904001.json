    "body": "Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia leader Patrick Harker said he supports the central bank doing more big rate increases at its coming meetings as it seeks to lower inflation.<br />“If there are no significant changes in the data in the coming weeks, I expect two additional 50-basis-point rate hikes in June and July,” Mr. Harker said Wednesday in a speech text. “After that, I anticipate a sequence of increases in the funds rate at a measured pace until we are confident that inflation is moving toward the [Federal Open Market] Committee’s inflation target.”"
