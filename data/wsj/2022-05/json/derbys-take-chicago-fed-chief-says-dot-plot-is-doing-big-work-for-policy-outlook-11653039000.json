    "body": "The Federal Reserve’s frequently maligned interest rate projections, compiled in the so-called dot plot, have been doing particularly vital work for the central bank over recent months, a veteran Fed official said.<br />Speaking with reporters Tuesday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans explained that the quarterly forecasts have been instrumental in conditioning markets on what the central bank is likely to do with its federal funds target rate, sparing the Fed from having to show its commitment to lower inflation via unpredictable and potentially very aggressive rate actions, as it did in 1994."
