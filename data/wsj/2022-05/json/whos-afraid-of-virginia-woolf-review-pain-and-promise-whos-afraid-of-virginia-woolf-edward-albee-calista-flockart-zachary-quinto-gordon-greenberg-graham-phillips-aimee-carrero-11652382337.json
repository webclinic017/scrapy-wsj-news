    "body": "Los Angeles<br />No play is indestructible. Each rises or falls anew every time the curtain goes up. That is what we sentimentally call the magic of theater, or less sentimentally, the peril of it. But if any work of dramatic art approaches indestructibility it is surely Edward Albee’s early masterwork “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” There is something granite-like in its almost perfect form, to say nothing of its bracingly savage wit, which cuts as sharply today as it did in 1962."
