    "body": "Americans face rising prices at nearly every turn, and the Biden Administration has picked a series of scapegoats to deflect responsibility. Its latest target is railroads, and its regulatory salvo could scramble logistics while doing little to ease prices.<br />The Surface Transportation Board (STB), which regulates freight railroads, voted in April to propose new rules to intervene more actively in scheduling and traffic. “Rail service has become even more unreliable,” the agency said in a statement, suggesting that delays have pushed up producer prices."
