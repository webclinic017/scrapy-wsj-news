    "body": "As I sat in my office during the first week of 1990, my assistant informed me that an unexpected caller wanted to speak with me. A week earlier I had an opinion piece in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch proposing that people on both sides of the abortion debate could work together on issues affecting women and children—without violating their core beliefs. As a start, I proposed support for legislation to aid impoverished women and their children.<br />B.J. Isaacson-Jones read the piece and wanted to know if I meant it. She was director of Reproductive Health Services, Missouri’s largest abortion clinic. I was a pro-life lawyer. I later learned that she was as nervous about making the call as I was about taking it."
