    "body": "After a bruising seven-way primary in Ohio, Donald Trump’s choice for the GOP U.S. Senate nomination—venture capitalist and author J.D. Vance—won Tuesday. His victory showed the strength of Mr. Trump’s support among Republicans, as well as its limitations.<br />The last poll before Mr. Trump endorsed on April 15—taken by the Trafalgar Group—showed Mr. Vance at about 23%, trailing former Treasurer Josh Mandel, who held 28%. Both candidates were ahead of businessman Mike Gibbons at 14%, state Sen. Matt Dolan at a little under 12%, former state GOP Chairwoman Jane Timken at just below 8%, and two others who together held roughly 3%. About 13% of voters were undecided."
