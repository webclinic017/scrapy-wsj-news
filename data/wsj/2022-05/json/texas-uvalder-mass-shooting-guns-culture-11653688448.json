    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Young Men, Guns and Guardrails” (May 26): I am old enough to remember being able to buy guns by mail order. As Texas Gov. Greg Abbott pointed out, 18-year-olds have been able to buy long guns for over 60 years. Yet schools, churches, movie theaters and grocery stores were not getting shot up as they are today. I also remember saying the Pledge of Allegiance in school, going to church, obeying my teachers and respecting the police. There were no first-person-shooter videogames and there was a lot less violence in the media. My parents and grandparents expected respect, civility and courtesy.<br />The erosion of cultural norms together with the deinstitutionalization of those with drug problems and mental illness lays bare what happens when a society takes down the guardrails of civil behavior. We end up with more people driving into the ditch and taking innocents with them."
