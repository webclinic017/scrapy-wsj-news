    "body": "Lenders to  KKR  & Co.’s Envision Healthcare are considering litigation after the physician-staffing company moved roughly half its value beyond their grasp to secure a fresh source of financing, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Centerbridge Partners LP and Angelo Gordon & Co. led the first-lien financing deal, which moved an estimated $2.5 billion in collateral away from most of Envision’s existing lenders, the people familiar said. The term lenders, which met to consider legal options on Monday, said the deal came at their expense as the first-lien debt was mostly provided by third-party financial institutions that had little existing credit exposure to Envision, according to people familiar with the deal."
