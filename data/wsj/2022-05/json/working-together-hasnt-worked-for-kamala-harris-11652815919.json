    "body": "It’s not easy being the vice president of the United States—especially when almost no one in Washington knows what the job of the vice president is. The latest in a series of Beltway media stories about the  challenges encountered by Kamala Harris suggests that neither her staff nor the staff of a recent predecessor understand the duties and power of the office. Now Ms. Harris is running out of time to seize a historic opportunity.<br />“The veep has cast more tie-breaking votes than all but two predecessors. It’s starting to frustrate some staff,” reports Politico’s  Eugene Daniels today."
