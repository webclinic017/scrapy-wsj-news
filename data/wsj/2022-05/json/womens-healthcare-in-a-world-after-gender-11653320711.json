    "body": "Regarding Patricia Posner’s op-ed “When Did ‘Woman’ Become a Dirty Word?” (May 10): Let’s recognize the elephant in the room. Healthcare has become corporate woke care. Doctors are no longer able to run their practices to the advantage of patients. They cater instead to the bottom line of corporations.<br />Women’s healthcare was always affected by male bias in medical trials. Now the degendering of healthcare is further undermining the system and female identification. Corporations will look at you not as a woman but as a birthing person."
