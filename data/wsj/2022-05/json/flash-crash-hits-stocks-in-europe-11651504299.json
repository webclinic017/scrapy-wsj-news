    "body": "Several European stock markets suffered a “flash crash” on Monday morning following sell orders by  Citigroup Inc.,  according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Trading was halted momentarily in several markets after major stock indexes plunged for a few minutes just before 10 a.m. Central European time. Stocks in the Nordic region were hit the hardest, though other European stocks also tumbled briefly on a day when share prices around the globe declined."
