    "body": "Contrary to Harvey Pitt’s assertions in “Sophisticated Private Investors Don’t Need the SEC’s Protection” (op-ed, April 29), the private-equity industry is a market failure. Supposedly sophisticated institutions throw money at PE funds despite their inability to beat the stock market, .<br />By the industry’s own admission, only 25% of funds beat the S&P 500, which leaves three-quarters as nonperformers. How does this persist, if such institutions can “fend for themselves”? Because the investment managers of these institutions are conflicted and the governance guardrails are nonexistent."
