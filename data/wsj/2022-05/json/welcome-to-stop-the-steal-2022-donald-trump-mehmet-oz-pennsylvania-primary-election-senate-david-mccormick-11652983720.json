    "body": "The votes in Pennsylvania aren’t all counted, and already President Trump is hinting that he might cry fraud if his endorsed candidate falls behind. On Wednesday his Senate pick, the TV doctor Mehmet Oz, led the GOP primary by roughly 2,500 votes. But some 105,000 mail ballots from both parties were yet to be tallied.<br />“Here we go again! In Pennsylvania they are unable to count the Mail-In Ballots. It is a BIG MESS,” Mr. Trump wrote on his  Twitter  knockoff, Truth Social. “Dr. Oz should declare victory. It makes it much harder for them to cheat with the ballots that they ‘just happened to find.’” On Thursday he added: “Stop FINDING VOTES in PENNSYLVANIA! RIGGED?” What a gent. This time the opponent Mr. Trump is discrediting happens to be a fellow Republican, David McCormick."
