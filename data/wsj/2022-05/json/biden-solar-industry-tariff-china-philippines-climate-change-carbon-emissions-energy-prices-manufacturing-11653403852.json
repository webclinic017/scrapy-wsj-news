    "body": "The Biden administration lobbies for renewable energy funding programs that nominally support the U.S. solar industry. However, I sit on the boards of four solar energy companies that are being harmed badly by existing U.S. tariffs and threats of new ones. Two of those companies are suffering through serious financial problems, and three are refocusing on Europe, Asia and Australia, where the solar markets are growing rapidly and suffer less from government interference.<br />How did the U.S., where silicon solar panels were invented, get to this point? In 2001 Silicon Valley’s  SunPower Corp.  created a compelling vision of the solar future by developing the cells covering the wings of NASA’s Helios solar-powered airplane with a 247-foot wingspan. Yet, SunPower almost went bankrupt that year in the dotcom crash. The problem was—and remains—manufacturing cost. According to SunPower founder, Dick Swanson, NASA’s price target for SunPower’s advanced solar cells was $60 per watt of power produced. That’s literally 375 times the market price of solar cells today."
