    "body": "I admire Thomas Hazlett’s valuable work on the history of U.S. spectrum policy, as he graciously acknowledges in his op-ed (“The U.S. May Repeat Mexico’s Wireless Spectrum Mistake,” May 13). But his article misrepresents my views and the goals of Rivada Networks, the company I founded.<br />Mr. Hazlett writes that “to adopt a plan imposed by regulators would allocate bandwidth top-down—reprising the twist of the 1927 Radio Act, which centralized bandwidth control.” But it is a myth, perpetuated by the big-carrier oligopoly, that spectrum is not allocated from the top down today."
