    "body": "Ernst & Young’s plan for a possible world-wide split of its audit and consulting businesses, code-named Project Everest according to people familiar with the matter, was dismissed by major rivals Friday who said they would keep their firms in one piece.<br />Fellow Big Four firms KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers issued statements defending their existing models of offering consulting and tax services alongside the bread-and-butter audit work. PwC said it has “no plans to change course,” whatever rival firms do. Deloitte said it remains committed to its current business model."
