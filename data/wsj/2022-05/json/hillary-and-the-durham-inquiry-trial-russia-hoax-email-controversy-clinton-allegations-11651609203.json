    "body": "One question that won’t come up in a trial that starts later this month of a Democratic Party lawyer is the same question that arose in the wake of Nixon’s Watergate crimes, committed on his way to a landslide victory. Why, when Hillary Clinton was expected to trounce Donald Trump in 2016, did she devote campaign resources, always in short supply, to a risky, unnecessary and possibly illegal effort to smear Mr. Trump with the Russia-collusion slur?<br />This effort involved not only the so-called Alfa Bank allegation at issue in the upcoming trial, but the Steele dossier allegations that are the subject of separate proceedings by U.S. special counsel John Durham."
