    "body": "While the Federal Reserve will certainly step up its rate rise campaign Wednesday, analysts don’t expect the central bank to really swing hard at surging inflation with a three quarter percentage point interest rate increase, and anticipate the Fed will try to tamp down on speculation of such a move at future policy meetings.<br />For now, there is a broad consensus among forecasters that this week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting will conclude with a half percentage point increase to the federal-funds target rate range to between 0.75% and 1%. The Fed is also nearly certain to announce a plan to shrink its $9 trillion balance sheet, as part of a two-pronged effort to lower levels of inflation that all of the central bank’s officials consider unacceptably high."
