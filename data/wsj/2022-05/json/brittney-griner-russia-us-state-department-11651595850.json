    "body": "The State Department has determined that women’s basketball star Brittney Griner is being wrongfully detained in Russia on drug charges, a significant change that puts the weight of the U.S. government behind the campaign for her release.<br />The shift comes in the wake of a surprise prisoner swap with Russia that freed American Trevor Reed, which indicated that there are still some channels of communication between the U.S. and Russia, even as war rages in Ukraine."
