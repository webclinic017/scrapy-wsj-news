    "body": "Deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill resulted from a confluence of factors (“The Mental Illness Pandemic” by Daniel Henninger, Wonder Land, May 19). Perhaps most important was the emergence of Thorazine, the revolutionary antipsychotic medication. This produced the psychiatric zeitgeist that outpatient treatment of psychotics was possible and preferred.<br />Compound this with the government’s desire to reduce spending on mental hospitals, court decisions regarding the civil liberties of the involuntarily hospitalized, popular culture (“One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest”), and some misconceived compassion and you see how we got here. I commend the psychiatric profession for later recanting its optimism about outpatient treatment for all psychotics and recommending a return to the ability of physicians to hospitalize involuntarily those who are truly too ill to be out and about in society."
