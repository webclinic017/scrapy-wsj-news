    "body": "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen visited the Senate on Tuesday to answer questions about risks to financial stability such as inflation, rising interest rates and volatile asset prices. But Democrats were more interested in her views on the risk that the Supreme Court might overturn Roe v. Wade. The exchange wasn’t helpful to their cause.<br />“What impact will the loss of abortion access mean economically for women?” New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez asked Ms. Yellen. She replied with a reductionist economic argument: “I believe eliminating the right of women to make decisions about when and whether to have children would have very damaging effects on the economy and would set women back by decades.”"
