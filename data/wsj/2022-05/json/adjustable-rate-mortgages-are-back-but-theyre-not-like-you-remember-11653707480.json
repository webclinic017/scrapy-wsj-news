    "body": "A jump in interest rates has revived demand for adjustable-rate mortgages. But these loans bear little resemblance to the ones blamed for fueling the 2008-09 financial crisis.<br />Applications for ARMs, a kind of mortgage that carries a lower rate in the loan’s early years, more than doubled in April from a year earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. More than 9% of mortgage applications submitted last week were for adjustable-rate mortgages, up from 4% a year ago."
