    "body": "Grubhub owner  Just Eat Takeaway.com ’s  share price fell nearly 70% over the past year. Trimming the fat might not help in the long run.<br />The European food-delivery giant said in April it would consider a full sale of Grubhub, a $7.3 billion acquisition it closed on just last year. Since the purchase, Jet’s results have been consistently dragged down by the U.S. food-delivery platform’s underperformance. Even if it manages to find a buyer, the very thing that crippled Grubhub could still hurt Jet."
