    "body": "Regarding your editorial on military aid to Ukraine (“Taking Ukraine Hostage to Covid,” May 3): A complementary policy to invest in U.S. and Western European security would be to encourage the migration of talent out of Russia. This would have a profound impact, as the movement of masses of critical talent have always had throughout the world.<br />Vladimir Putin forgot that the “G” in “MiG” is an abbreviation for its originators, Mikhail Gurevich, a Ukrainian Jew who graduated school and university in Kharkiv, and the “M” is for Artem Mikoyan, an Armenian. The war will doubtless turn Ukraine into an emptied land—how many of the millions who left even before this war started would go back? But how many smart Russians would continue to work for this barbarian regime? Some have already escaped to Armenia and Finland."
