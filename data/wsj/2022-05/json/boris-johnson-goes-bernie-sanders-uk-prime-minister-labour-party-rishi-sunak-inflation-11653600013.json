    "body": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was embarrassed by this week’s report on his pandemic lockdown-busting parties, but the greatest political danger to his tenure is his mismanagement of inflation. His Tory government is handling it even worse than the Biden Administration is.<br />This week Rishi Sunak, Mr. Johnson’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, rolled out another package of subsidies for households walloped by rising energy prices. This will include £650 each to about eight million people who receive means-tested social benefits. He’s doubling, to £400, an energy-bill discount for all households and converting it from an automatic loan into a subsidy."
