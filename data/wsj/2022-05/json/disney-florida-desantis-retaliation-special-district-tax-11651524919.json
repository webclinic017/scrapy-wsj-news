    "body": "Paybacks are hell. Even those of us troubled by government retaliation can be forgiven our schadenfreude at Florida’s abolition of the Reedy Creek Improvement District (“Revolt in Disney’s Florida Kingdom,” Review & Outlook, April 22). The Walt  Disney Co.  certainly earned that by its hubris.<br />On the other hand, the Reedy Creek district originally served—indeed, still serves—a public purpose in providing essential governmental services for the very large tract of land that encompasses Disney World. Special districts are established to meet special circumstances."
