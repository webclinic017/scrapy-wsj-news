    "body": "We do not know how the war in Ukraine will end, but it is already evident that it represents a turning point in contemporary history.<br />To begin with, the war has ended the debate about the purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the possibility of its expansion. Strategists who feared that extending its protective umbrella to Central Europe and the Baltics would provoke Russia acknowledge that the invasion makes further expansion inevitable. Finland and Sweden, which previously shied away from a formal relationship with the alliance, appear on the verge of applying for membership. Emmanuel Macron, recently re-elected as France’s president, is unlikely to renew his oft-repeated charge that NATO is “brain dead.”"
