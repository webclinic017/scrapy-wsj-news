    "body": "A standard-setter in carbon offsets is clamping down on cryptocurrency projects in the sector, saying they add confusion to the fast-growing market that companies tap to compensate for their emissions.<br />Verra, a nonprofit organization that runs a registry of carbon credits, said on Wednesday it would no longer allow credits to be retired from its database to create new crypto tokens. The move, which Verra said takes effect immediately, would restrict the ability of crypto project developers to piggyback on the rapid growth of the voluntary carbon market."
