    "body": "The political campaign to save Roe v. Wade includes urgent warnings about all the other historic precedents that are now purportedly under threat. Listen instead to Yale Law Professor Akhil Reed Amar, who supports abortion rights but is honest enough to rain on this implausible parade of horribles.<br />“Lib law professors, you’re just trying to scare people with boogeymen or something about ‘Oh, my God, Griswold is at risk,’” Mr. Amar said on his podcast last week, referring to the High Court’s 1965 precedent protecting contraceptive access for married couples. “Every single Republican Party platform for the last 40 years has said ‘we hate Roe,’” he countered. “There’s never been anything like that about Griswold.”"
