    "body": "House Members took turns pounding Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Robert Califf on Wednesday over the baby formula shortage. Congress always needs a punching bag, but the main culprit is the FDA leviathan.<br />Dr. Califf was confirmed to his post on Feb. 15, two days before Abbott’s formula recall. He can’t be blamed for the agency’s dilatory response to problems at the plant. But he and other agency leaders could have moved more quickly to address the formula shortage, which owes in large part to FDA regulation."
