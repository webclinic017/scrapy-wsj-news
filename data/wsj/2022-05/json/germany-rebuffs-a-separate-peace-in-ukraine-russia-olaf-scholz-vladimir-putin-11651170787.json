    "body": "It’s a good bet Vladimir Putin hopes that, as his Ukraine war drags on, Western allies will be tempted to sacrifice Ukraine for the sake of ending the conflict. So kudos to lawmakers in Berlin for staring down Mr. Putin’s many attempts to bully Germany and others into negotiating a separate peace.<br />The German parliament on Thursday passed, 586-100, a resolution calling on Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government to step up its shipments of heavy weapons to Kyiv. The government on Tuesday finally announced it will send Ukraine 50 Cheetah anti-aircraft tanks, although Mr. Scholz still is reluctant to send other systems such as the Leopard tank."
