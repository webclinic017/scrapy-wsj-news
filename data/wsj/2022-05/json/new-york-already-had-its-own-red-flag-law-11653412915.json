    "body": "Regarding your editorial “The Massacre in Buffalo” (May 16): According to the website for New York’s red-flag gun-protection law, “The Red Flag Law, also known as the extreme risk protection order law, is effective in New York State as of August 24, 2019. The law prevents individuals who show signs of being a threat to themselves or others from purchasing or possessing any kind of firearm.”<br />Payton Gendron, the shooter in Buffalo, had been referred to police by schoolteachers because he wrote that he wanted to perpetrate a mass shooting. Police had him taken to a hospital, where he underwent a psychiatric evaluation."
