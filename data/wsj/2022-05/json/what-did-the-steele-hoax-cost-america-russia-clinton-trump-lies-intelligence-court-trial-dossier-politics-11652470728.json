    "body": "A Wall Street Journal investigative report this week underlines just how frivolous were the claims in the Steele dossier, and how nonexistent was the attempt by Christopher Steele, the vaunted British ex-spy, to verify or even vet them.<br />The sources for many of the Steele allegations consisted of three people “brought together over a minor corporate-publicity contract,” not one of whom had any inside knowledge of Kremlin politics or the Trump campaign: the itinerant Washington-based, Russia-born researcher Igor Danchenko; a childhood friend, Olga Galina, who was employed by a Cyprus-based internet company; and Charles Dolan, a U.S. public-relations executive from whom the Cyprus company was seeking unrelated advice."
