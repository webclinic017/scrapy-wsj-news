    "body": "The unmasking judge, Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, “is taking abuse for being a 35-year-old Trump appointee” (“America’s Unmasked Singers,” Review & Outlook, April 20). I write as a 76-year-old retired lawyer and judge to remind the class that Justice Joseph Story, one of the two or three best ever on the Supreme Court, was appointed at 32. Youth is not disqualifying.<br />Sure, Story was nominated by President James Madison rather than President Donald Trump. But every judge is nominated by some president or other. How about President Millard Fillmore?"
