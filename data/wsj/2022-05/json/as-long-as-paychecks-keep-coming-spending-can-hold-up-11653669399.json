That was a bit more than economists had estimated, and came on top of an upward revision to the March spending figures. Notably, spending continues to outpace inflation—the Commerce Department said that its measure of inflation (which is the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge) rose 0.2% in April from a month earlier."
