    "body": "Dan Henninger is on target with “The Mental Illness Pandemic” (Wonder Land, May 19). There was little follow-through after deinstitutionalization. There are community mental-health agencies but virtually no authority to get people into treatment when they need it and are too far gone to know that they need it.<br />Although I applaud the shift away from hospitalizing people against their will without due process, we have a process for deciding if someone is a “danger to self and others.” We need to reinvigorate that process with clear criteria. Suicidal ideation evokes sympathy, and those who recognize it in time can often do something about it. Threats to others, for some reason, aren’t addressed thoroughly—with deadly consequences."
