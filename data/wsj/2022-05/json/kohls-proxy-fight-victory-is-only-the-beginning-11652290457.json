    "body": "A bitter campaign and a poison pill later,  Kohl’s  has emerged the victor in the proxy fight against an activist investor. But that is only the beginning for the department-store chain.<br />On Wednesday, Kohl’s shareholders rejected activist investor Macellum Advisors’ push to replace up to 10 directors. Macellum had renewed its push for changes at Kohl’s starting in January, including for a sale process, which Kohl’s subsequently hired  Goldman Sachs  to run. The department-store chain has said on its website that it engaged with more than 20 interested parties."
