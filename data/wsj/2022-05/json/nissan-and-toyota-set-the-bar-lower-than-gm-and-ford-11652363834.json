    "body": "Toyota  and  Nissan  are giving more warning signals about the road ahead than their American peers. This is misleading: The Japanese players may actually handle it better.<br />Nissan said it expected an operating profit of 250 billion yen, equivalent to roughly $1.9 billion, for the year through March 2023—in line with what it achieved in the last fiscal year. Analyst forecasts currently average ¥316 billion, according to FactSet, so they may come down. Thursday’s announcement came after the Tokyo close, but shares in French car maker  Renault ,  which owns 43% of Nissan, fell about 7% in European trading."
