    "body": "Democrats in New York are going through the stages of grief after a state court last week redrew their wild gerrymander of U.S. House districts. But former mayor Bill de Blasio arrived at acceptance Friday, announcing a run for Congress in the new 10th district, saying voters might want “someone with some history and stature.”<br />Mr. de Blasio is 6-foot-5, so we’ll give him stature, and he’s got history all right: New Yorkers might recall his mayoral habit of showing up late. Or the Groundhog Day that he dropped the rodent-of-honor, which died soon after of internal injuries that the zoo insisted were unrelated. Two more candidates, including Rep. Mondaire Jones, also have their hearts set on the 10th district, and it could be a crowded debate."
