    "body": "Would the public be served by a government lawsuit to block  Microsoft ’s  proposed $69 billion purchase of game maker  Activision ,  owner of the popular “Call of Duty” franchise? Investors who’ve been bidding down Activision’s stock apparently fear such a case is about to happen.<br />If so, the record isn’t only unpromising, it suggests an antitrust machine running downhill toward decadence. Only the 1982  AT&T  breakup produced a clear payoff for the public, dismantling a long-distance monopoly fostered by public policy. The yearslong government pursuit of Microsoft and, before that,  IBM  cost millions and famously ended in whimpers. This column once amused itself with federal lawsuits alleging monopolization by “superpremium” ice cream makers or office-supply stores. All had their defenders but none were so tasteless as to claim the American people would notice any benefit from these cases."
