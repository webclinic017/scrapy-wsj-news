    "body": "When it comes to naming a company, new entrepreneurs are all business, but experienced ones go for the gut.<br />When coming up with a name for their first venture, entrepreneurs devise ones that emphasize what they do as a company, a practice called cognitive naming, according to research from Yuval Engel, an assistant professor at the University of Amsterdam. More-experienced entrepreneurs tend to use names that resonate with peopleâ€™s feelings, or emotive naming, Prof. Engel finds."
