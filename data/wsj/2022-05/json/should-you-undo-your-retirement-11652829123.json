    "body": "A tight labor market and flexible work options in the gig economy would seem to make re-entering the job market an enticing prospect for retirees. And many are doing just that.<br />But behavioral economics tells us that there are likely a lot more retirees who would return to the workforce, if only they weren’t held back by cognitive blind spots.
