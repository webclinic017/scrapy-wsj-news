    "body": "A Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman, Lieutenant Chris Olivarez, described the gunman as “just a complete evil person.”<br />Was that it? Was Salvador Ramos evil? Or was he an unhappy young man who stuttered, had a lisp, was bullied and mocked by the other students and came from a dysfunctional home with a mother who used drugs? Why do people do these things? Because they are unhappy? Because they are crazy? Or can it be that they are, in truth . . . evil? Evil is a very big word."
