They skipped two companies launched by a Russian media mogul, which are still trading and are on the hunt for acquisitions.<br />Two special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, created by Russian businessman and investor Ivan Tavrin have continued trading normally on the  Nasdaq Stock Market  even as other large Russian companies and exchange-traded funds remain suspended."
