    "body": "One of the biggest names in crypto is bullish on the future of  Robinhood  Markets. That makes sense. But others might think twice before settling down in Sherwood forest.<br />The disclosure on Thursday that Sam Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old billionaire who founded the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has bought a 7.6% stake in Robinhood sent the online brokerage’s shares soaring, up nearly 25% so far on Friday. To be sure, the stock is still down some 40% this year, and is nearly 90% off its peak price."
