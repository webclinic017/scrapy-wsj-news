    "body": "Barton Swaim eloquently exposes the dangers posed by intellectuals and government officials who, insisting that facts “speak for themselves,” arrogantly assume that their own particular interpretations of the facts are correct beyond dispute (“How Disagreement Became ‘Disinformation,’” op-ed, May 14). For any person infected by this conceit, it’s a short leap to the conclusion that the good of society requires the silencing of individuals who disagree with his or her interpretation.<br />No clearer recent example of such pre-enlightenment dogmatism exists than Francis Collins conniving with Anthony Fauci to silence and discredit the scientists who wrote the Great Barrington Declaration in opposition to the pandemic lockdowns. Ironically, like every such censorious effort, Drs. Collins and Fauci’s attempt to smear the Great Barrington Declaration and its proponents loudly announces the censors’ own justified fear that their interpretation of the data will be exposed as flawed by open debate."
