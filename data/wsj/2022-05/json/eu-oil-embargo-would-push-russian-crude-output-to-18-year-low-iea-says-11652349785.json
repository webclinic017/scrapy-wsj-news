    "body": "PARIS—Western pressure on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine lowered the country’s crude-oil output by 9% in April and reshaped the global oil market as Russia sought new markets for its production outside the West, the International Energy Agency said.<br />Russia’s lost supplies amounted to 900,000 barrels a day in April and are expected to grow by a further 600,000 barrels a day this month—totaling around 1.5% of the world’s oil output when the invasion began. An oil embargo being considered by the European Union, the biggest destination for Russian crude, would likely push those losses to as much as 3 million barrels a day from July, bringing Russian oil production to its lowest level in nearly two decades, the IEA said in its monthly report Thursday."
