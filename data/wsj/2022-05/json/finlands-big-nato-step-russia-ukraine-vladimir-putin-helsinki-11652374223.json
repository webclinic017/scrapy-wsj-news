    "body": "Plenty of delusions led to Vladimir Putin’s attempted conquest of Ukraine, and one of the biggest was assuming that the war would weaken NATO. The alliance is more unified after the invasion, and it’s now set to accept nations that didn’t join even at the height of the Cold War.<br />“NATO membership would strengthen Finland’s security. As a member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defence alliance,” the Finnish President and Prime Minister said in a statement Thursday. “Finland must apply for NATO membership without delay. We hope that the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days.”"
