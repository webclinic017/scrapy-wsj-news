    "body": "The “transitory” inflation crowd took another beating on Wednesday, as April’s expected decline in the rate of increase in the consumer-price index (CPI) turned out to be disappointing. If this means we’ve reached “peak” inflation, we’re merely fallen from Mount Everest to K2.<br />The pace of inflation slowed 0.3% in the month, but most of that was due to a 6.1% decline in gasoline prices. That is already out of date as gas prices have since rebounded to hit a new record this week. The CPI rose 8.3% over the last 12 months, which was down slightly from 8.5% in March. But the inflation rate over the last three months is 9.9%. If inflation is slowing, it’s hard to detect."
