    "body": "“New Starbucks Opens In Restroom Of Existing Starbucks” was a brilliant satirical headline back in 1998 when the coffee chain already seemed ubiquitous. As of a month ago, the day that Howard Schultz returned for his third stint as chief executive officer, it had nearly 10 times as many shops in North America.<br />When Mr. Schultz revealed that store count along with the chain’s unspectacular fiscal-second-quarter results, the chain’s shares were down by more than 40% from their all-time high last summer. Cost and wage pressures along with a bitterly contested unionization drive at home, and a recent sales collapse in China, the chain’s second-largest market, all weighed on sentiment. But this past Wednesday, the first trading session following the release, the shares surged by nearly 10% in their best day since a sharp rebound in March 2020 following the Covid-19 market panic. That came despite the fact that the company suspended financial guidance for this year."
