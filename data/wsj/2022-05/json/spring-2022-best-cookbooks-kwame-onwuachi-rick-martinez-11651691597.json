    "body": "NOW MORE THAN EVER, people rely on cookbooks to travel to the places they’ve never been—and the places they long to return to. But in the quest for dishes that conjure a place and its people, it’s easy to lose track of a basic question: Who’s doing the cooking, which stories get told and what exactly is an authentic recipe anyway? Two new cookbooks grapple with those questions—and deliver delicious answers.<br />In “Mi Cocina: Recipes and Rapture from My Kitchen in Mexico” (Clarkson Potter), ex-Bon Appétit food editor Rick Martínez shares dishes inspired by a nearly two-year journey through every state in Mexico, one he began in 2019. But Mr. Martínez doesn’t claim to be an expert in Mexican cuisine. After a childhood eating Chef Boyardee in Austin, Texas, he freely admits, he “had a very scattered, incomplete picture of Mexico.”"
