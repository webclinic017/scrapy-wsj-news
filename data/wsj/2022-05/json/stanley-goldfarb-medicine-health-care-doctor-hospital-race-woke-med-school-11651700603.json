    "body": "The recent letters by leaders of Brigham and Women’s Hospital (May 3) and the Association of American Medical Colleges (April 29) leave out key details. Responding to my op-ed on how antiracist ideology is corrupting healthcare (“Keep Politics Out of the Doctor’s Office,” April 19), their denials show how deep the rot goes.<br />Brigham and Women’s Sunil Eappen and Mallika Mendu write, “We are not moving toward preferential care for any group.” Yet last year their hospital announced a pilot initiative cast in exactly those terms: a “preferential admission option for Black and Latinx heart failure patients.” It’s a sign of things to come. Race-based care is a fundamental demand of the activist set."
