    "body": "Agricultural commodities may be one of the last options left on the menu for investors reeling from a global stock- and bond-market crash.<br />While the war in Ukraine, shipping disruptions and rising oil and fertilizer prices were an initial impetus for grain prices to rise, protectionism is showing up as a new threat. And with inflation already on the rise in Asia, such measures could end up exacerbating food price pressures globally, according to Sonal Varma, an analyst with Nomura. In a brutal market for nearly every type of asset, basic food commodities like wheat and corn—and formerly below-the-radar companies that process and trade them, such as  Archer Daniels Midland  and Bunge—could end up as relatively safe havens, at least as long as the war lasts."
