    "body": "What was Olaf Scholz doing in Tokyo last week? The visit will be clanging alarm bells in Beijing as China anxiously tracks the fallout from Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.<br />The newish German chancellor’s trip to Japan to discuss economic and strategic cooperation is a sign of a major change under way in Berlin. The clue is the destination Mr. Scholz skipped: Beijing. Mr. Scholz’s predecessor, Angela Merkel, visited China the way Chicagoans vote—early and often. Her first jaunt to Beijing came six months after she took office, and she visited China twice as often as Japan during her 16 years in office. That Mr. Scholz shows signs of bucking this trend is significant."
