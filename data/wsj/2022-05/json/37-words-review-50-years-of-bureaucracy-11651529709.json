    "body": "When Richard Nixon signed Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the news was greeted with a yawn. The law had bipartisan support and its guiding purpose—prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex in educational institutions—was so uncontroversial that the New York Times gave the story a mere sentence of coverage. Fast forward a few decades: Title IX is one of the most consequential domestic laws of our time, a lightning rod of controversy and a textbook example of the way our regulatory apparatus can make an Orwellian muddle out of noble ideals.<br />The bill’s 50th anniversary would seem to be a good time to reflect on this troubling evolution. Alas, journalist-activist Sherry Boschert’s “37 Words: Title IX and Fifty Years of Fighting Sex Discrimination” doesn’t show much interest in the law’s profound and unexpected effects. Her indifference will not reassure anyone uneasy about the so-called administrative state—the vast unelected bureaucracy that has given us, among much else, the current iteration of Title IX regulations."
