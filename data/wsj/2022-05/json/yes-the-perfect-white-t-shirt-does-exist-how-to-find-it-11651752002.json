    "body": "“SIMPLICITY IS the most difficult thing to secure in this world,” wrote George Sand (aka Amantine-Lucile-Aurore Dudevant). In her mid-19th century heyday, women were more concerned with corsets and trains than comfy tops. But her declaration could easily apply to the modern quest for simplicity—in the form of the perfect, plain white tee that universally satisfies in terms of fit, look and feel. It’s fashion’s white whale.<br />Many have attempted to capture this elusive, cotton prey. In the mid-2000s, Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen made the perfect tee their mission. They launched their line the Row in 2006 and an extra-soft, roomy, white tee with a single French seam was among the brand’s first garments. In 2017, stylist Karla Welch and her client Justin Bieber tried their luck, devising a handful of “perfect” options for men and women—including cropped and sleeveless takes—under the label x Karla. Now sold by retailers including MatchesFashion.com, the tees have satisfied a lucky few, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Kaia Gerber. But for many, the hunt continues."
