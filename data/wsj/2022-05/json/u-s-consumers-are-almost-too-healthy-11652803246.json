    "body": "Retail sales are one of the first places investors turn to figure out how U.S. consumers are faring, but the sales data might be understating just how heady consumer demand is.<br />The Commerce Department on Tuesday reported that retail sales, which encompass spending in stores, at restaurants and online, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.9% in April from a month earlier. That was slightly below the 1% economists had forecast, but since it came alongside a big upward revision to the March retail sales figures—the Commerce Department now says they rose 1.4% from a month earlier as opposed to 0.5%—it counted as a solid report."
