    "body": "Matthew Hennessey’s op-ed “An Econ Lesson From a Science Teacher” (April 26), adapted from his new book “Visible Hand,” cheerfully demonstrates how influential educators can be on our personal sense of economics. By contrast, my 1974 high-school science and mathematics teachers banded together to offer a class in “futuristics,” a blend of alarming, Paul Ehrlich-inspired graphs and extrapolations filling our young minds with overpopulation, exhausted resources, endless war and so forth.<br />Meanwhile, as my classmates and I were being told we had no future, Steve Jobs was in India experimenting with Buddhism and LSD."
