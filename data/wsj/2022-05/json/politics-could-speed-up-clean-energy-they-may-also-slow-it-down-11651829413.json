    "body": "In the world’s transition to lower-emission fuels, politics is a big part of both the solution and the problem.<br />Decarbonization is shaping up to be the next industrial revolution—a massive shift that will lead to the decline of some industries and the rise of others, creating both risks and opportunities for investors.
