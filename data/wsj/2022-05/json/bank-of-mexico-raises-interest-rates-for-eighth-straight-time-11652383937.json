    "body": "MEXICO CITY—The Bank of Mexico raised interest rates in the face of rising inflation and tighter global monetary conditions, and hinted at the possibility of bigger increases in the future if inflation continues unabated.<br />The central bank’s five-member board voted 4-1 Thursday to lift the overnight interest-rate target by half a percentage point to 7.0%, as expected, an eighth consecutive increase since June of last year and the fourth straight half-point move."
