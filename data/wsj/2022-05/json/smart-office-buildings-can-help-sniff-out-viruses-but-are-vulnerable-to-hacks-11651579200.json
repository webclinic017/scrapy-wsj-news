    "body": "The moment that  Honeywell International Inc.  employees enter their new headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., the smart building goes to work.<br />A camera recognizes employeesâ€™ faces and hails an elevator programmed to bring them to their floor. Sensors on the walls measure particles and CO2 levels in meeting rooms, pumping in fresh air when levels rise too high. Higher levels of certain particles mean it is more likely that viruses could be present. In a control room, big screens show every floor in the 23-story building."
