    "body": "At a time when expectations for retailers are this bearish, better-than-expected results go a long way.<br />Best Buy  said on Tuesday that comparable-store sales in the U.S. declined 8.5% in its quarter ended April 30. That was better than the 10% decline analysts polled by Visible Alpha were expecting. But net income fell by nearly 43%, which was worse than the 37% drop Wall Street had estimated. The company lowered its sights for the year and now expects comparable sales to fall by 3% to 6%. About three months ago it was expecting a decline of 1% to 4%."
