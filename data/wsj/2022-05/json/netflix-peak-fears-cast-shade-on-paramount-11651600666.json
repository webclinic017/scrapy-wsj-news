    "body": "Paramount Global ’s  streaming business is doing well, if anyone still cares.<br />The media giant that changed its name from ViacomCBS earlier this year said Tuesday morning that it added 6.8 million subscribers to its namesake Paramount+ streaming service during the first quarter. That exceeded Wall Street’s projections and beat the net additions reported by its main streaming competitors so far this earnings season. HBO Max picked up just over 3 million domestic subscribers during the first quarter while Peacock added 4 million.  Disney  is expected to show a little over 5 million net new subscribers for  Disney + when it reports its own results next week."
