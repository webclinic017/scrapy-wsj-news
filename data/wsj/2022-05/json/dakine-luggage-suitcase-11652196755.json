In 1986 Dakine had moved to windsurfing-central in Hood River, Ore., and begun years of expansion into bike and snow sports, apparel and more. I discovered the brand nearly 20 years ago, when my then-boyfriend, who had a great eye for accessories, bought himself a Dakine snowboarding bag and matching rolly suitcase in a retro brown-plaid pattern. (The closest match today is the “Status Roller 42L” suitcase and ski bag. The plaid is long gone but romantics can opt for the “Solstice Floral.”) Back then, we were a snowboarder/skier duo, based in Europe, hitting Courchevel, Zermatt, Chamonix."
