    "body": "A roughly 7% slide in the euro against the dollar this year is breathing new life into a two-decade old question on Wall Street: Will this be the year the currencies finally reach parity?<br />The euro fell as low as around $1.035 earlier this month, down from the $1.137 level at which it ended last year. It finished Thursday at about $1.059, putting it just 5.5% away from reaching parity, or equal value with the dollar."
