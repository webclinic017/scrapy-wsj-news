    "body": "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and her political allies are indefatigable in their attempt to railroad Congress into agreeing to a global tax deal, and their latest argument is that the pact will be good for U.S. competitiveness. If only that were true.<br />At issue is an agreement last year at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to upend century-old international tax principles. The first prong is a form of excess-profits tax targeted primarily at the largest U.S. tech companies, to be applied in markets where they operate rather than where they are headquartered. The second is a minimum effective tax rate of 15% to be applied to the profits of global firms."
