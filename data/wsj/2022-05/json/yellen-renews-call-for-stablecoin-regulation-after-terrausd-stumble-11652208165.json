    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”A decline this week in the price of a major cryptocurrency that was purportedly pegged to the dollar prompted Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Tuesday to reiterate calls for Congress to authorize regulation of so-called stablecoins.<br />TerraUSD, the fourth-largest stablecoin and 10th-largest cryptocurrency by market value according to CoinMarketCap, saw its price fall as low as 69 cents Monday after a series of large withdrawals over the weekend. Like other stablecoins, TerraUSD is intended to be a haven of sorts for cryptocurrency investors, with its price designed to remain fixed at $1."
