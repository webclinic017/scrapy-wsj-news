    "body": "Peloton ’s  precipitous rise and fall is a  Netflix  series waiting to happen. That may not be the only way the two tech platforms should feature together in investors’ minds.<br />Peloton said Tuesday morning its connected fitness products revenue for the March quarter fell 42% from a year earlier as the pandemic boon in demand for hardware continues to wane. The company reported a loss of $194 million on the basis of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization—compared with a profit of $63 million on that basis in the year-ago period. Free cash flow was a negative $746.7 million, as inventory payments far exceeded demand."
