    "body": "A group of congressional Democrats wrote to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Thursday and requested the bank select a Latino to fill its vacant leadership position.<br />“Increasing diversity and Latino representation throughout the Federal Reserve System and the federal government as a whole is critical to ensuring our public sector reflects our communities and the general population,” said a letter sent to the bank, as well as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, by members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. “We write to urge you to select one of the many highly qualified Latino candidates to fill the Dallas vacancy.”"
