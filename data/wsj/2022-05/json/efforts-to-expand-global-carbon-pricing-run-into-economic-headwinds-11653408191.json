    "body": "Companies are paying more for their greenhouse-gas emissions than ever before, but prices aren’t high enough to curb global warming and economic headwinds could deter governments from raising them, the World Bank said.<br />Around the world, revenue from carbon-pricing policies such as carbon taxes and emissions-trading systems surged to around $84 billion in 2021, up 60% from 2020. This was largely driven by the rising cost of pollution allowances on emissions markets in the European Union, California and elsewhere, according to a World Bank report published on Tuesday. Nearly 23% of global greenhouse-gas emissions are now covered by a carbon price of some kind, up from 21.5% last year, the report said, but prices are generally too low to motivate low-carbon investments that could reduce reliance on fossil fuels, it said."
