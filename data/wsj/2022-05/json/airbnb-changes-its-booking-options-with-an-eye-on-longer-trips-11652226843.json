    "body": "Airbnb Inc.  is introducing a new feature today to cater to travelers with longer trips in mind.<br />The companyâ€™s new split-stay feature allows guests booking trips for one week or more to divide trips between two different homes. Chief Executive Brian Chesky says the option can help travelers find nearby properties when there is limited availability on certain dates or allow travelers to try more than one property. Guests will generally see around 40% more listings when searching for longer stays with this feature, the company says."
