    "body": "ANDREW SHEAR’S SON is in preschool, but the 36-year-old dad has already purchased his child’s college graduation gift: a Rolex Daytona from 2017, the year his son was born. Mind you, Mr. Shear is a vintage watch dealer through his company Sheartime, so he’s professionally obligated to believe mechanical watches will still be covetable in 2040. Tradition is on his side: Watches have been beloved milestone gifts for at least a century. A 1928 Elgin watch ad shilling bezels between $15 and $1,500 declares: “This solves the graduation gift problem.”<br />With a penchant for vintage, today’s grads, who have grown up with the internet at their fingertips (and on their wrists), obsess over old-school watches’ mechanical workings and supreme style. “Young customers come in having been up all night studying on YouTube,” said Ruediger Albers, U.S. president of watch retailer Wempe. According to Ira Melnitsky, U.S. president and CEO at Tourneau | Bucherer, which has seen an uptick in grad-watch sales in the past three years, the youths “appreciate a mechanical item that’s not disposable.”"
