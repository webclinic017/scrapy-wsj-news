    "body": "Justice Samuel Alito’s draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization has provoked liberal fury for rejecting stare decisis, a juridical principle to ensure consistency in law’s application (“The Abortion Disinformation Campaign,” Review & Outlook, May 5). In so reacting, liberals undermine the hermeneutic guiding the liberal majority since at least Brown v. Board of Education (1954) and certainly in the Burger Court that produced Roe v. Wade (1973). The notion of a living Constitution allowed liberal justices to extend their own opinions beyond the Constitution’s literal sense and original meaning, making it a malleable tool to accommodate new circumstances.<br />Since circumstances change, liberals should hardly be surprised if Justice Alito’s opinion better fits new times. Roe v. Wade’s judicial activism, which divided the country and undermined the unity that law is supposed to serve, needs reassessment. It is paradoxical that Justice Alito’s originalism should prove more flexibly and democratically adapted to new times, leaving decisions to the people. When a protean hermeneutic rules, confusion inevitably results. Justice Alito serves well by providing the present age with standards upholding constitutional consistency—the text means what it says—and adapted to new needs."
