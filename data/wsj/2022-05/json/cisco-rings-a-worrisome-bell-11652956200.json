    "body": "Cisco Systems  is nothing if not reliable. Rare disappointments tend to be painful.<br />The tech heavyweight known best for its networking and security equipment and software said Wednesday that revenue for its fiscal third quarter ended April 30 was flat year over year at $12.8 billion. That was about 4% below Wall Street’s consensus forecast and is only the second time in at least five years that the company’s revenue has missed analysts’ projections, according to FactSet. And that wasn’t the only bad news: The midpoint of Cisco’s projection for the current quarter implied revenue of about $12.7 billion, some 8% shy of Wall Street’s target."
