    "body": "My mother taught me to cook—with a patience that, as I look back now, seems nearly saintly. Maybe because of the let’s-get-this-done mindset that led me to major in engineering, I have always valued efficiency. In cooking that means perfectly chopped vegetables in their respective bowls. Color-coordinated knives for different meats. The spices arranged in proper order before cooking begins. A precise scale for weighing ingredients just as the recipe says.<br />It turns out that’s not how good cooking works. My mother isn’t exactly carefree in the kitchen, but compared with my own anxiety about precision, her intuition seems aggravatingly breezy and calm. She just knows when food is done. While I would stand watching the kitchen clock, she’d call out casually from the living room that the bread was ready. And she was always right. How is an engineer supposed to learn that skill?"
