    "body": "With Elon Musk’s promise to restore free speech on  Twitter ,   Disney  employees expressing dismay with its political activism in Florida, and  Netflix  saying it won’t make content choices based on staffers’ political views, the time is ripe to restore a business culture that respects American freedoms and ideals as well as diverse views among employees, customers, shareholders, and the general public.<br />But those who value freedom of speech, religious liberty, and free markets can’t expect that random bursts of encouraging news will foster such a culture. This is especially true considering how captive U.S. businesses have become to a left-wing political agenda that many of their employees, customers, and shareholders don’t support, and that many Americans don’t want imposed on them by powerful governments or private actors."
