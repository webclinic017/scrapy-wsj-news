    "body": "Nowhere outside the former Soviet Union did Vladimir Putin have more success in rebuilding Russia’s great-power position than in the Middle East. Now, however, as Mr. Putin counts the costs of his bungled Ukraine adventure, it is not clear whether Russia’s Middle East gains can survive.<br />Capitalizing on American errors like President Obama’s failure to enforce his threats of a military response to Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war, Russia inserted itself into Middle Eastern politics and defended the Assad regime from its domestic opponents. The success, ugly but real, of that Russian intervention seriously damaged American prestige, increased Moscow’s leverage over Turkey, supported Russia’s outreach to oil-rich Arab states, and forced Israel to ask Russia’s permission to carry out operations against Iranian proxies in Syria."
