    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Biden’s Solar Tariff Brawl” (May 23) and T.J. Rodgers’s op-ed “Tariffs Throw Shade on the Solar Industry” (May 25): Since antidumping and countervailing duties were instituted in 2012 and 2014, and “safeguard” tariffs in 2018, growth in the U.S. solar industry has outpaced all projections while prices fell. U.S.-based solar manufacturing grew strongly, accounting for nearly 20% of U.S. consumption. This year’s price increase in solar panels is due to supply-chain snafus, shipping-cost increases and excessive dependence on Asian supplies, not tariffs.<br />Experience since 2018 shows that a simple, comprehensive tariff policy limiting the penetration of subsidized Chinese solar products can support the healthy growth of the U.S. industry. But Chinese solar manufacturers, led and orchestrated by the Communist Party, are resourceful. They now rely on facilities in Southeast Asia to evade U.S. tariffs. The U.S. solar installers who want to make the U.S. dependent on cheap Chinese solar equipment—manufactured with slave labor and produced with coal-fired electricity—are playing into the hands of the Chinese government."
