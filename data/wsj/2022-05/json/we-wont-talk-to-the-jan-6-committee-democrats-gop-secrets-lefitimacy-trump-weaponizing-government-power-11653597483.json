    "body": "While Americans are struggling to put gas in the tank and food on the table, Democrats are busy weaponizing government to attack Republicans. Look no further than the Jan. 6 Select Committee investigation.<br />Democrats created the Select Committee last year and packed it with partisans. Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected Republicans’ chosen members, violating more than 232 years of House precedent, and also declined to appoint the required 13 members. These actions deprive the committee of balance and objectivity and raise questions about its legitimacy."
