    "body": "“Woe is me, for I am undone,” cried Isaiah. The courtly prophet had gone into the Temple in Jerusalem in a time of national grief, and there he had experienced a vision of the Lord God in his holiness. What Isaiah saw next was his own sin.<br />In a similar moment, the Southern Baptist Convention has received the report from an independent investigation into sexual abuse and the handling of abuse claims by the SBC’s executive committee. Like Isaiah seeing his own sin, Southern Baptists have been presented a report that reveals a decadeslong effort on the part of some denominational leaders to deny or even conceal credible charges of sexual abuse."
