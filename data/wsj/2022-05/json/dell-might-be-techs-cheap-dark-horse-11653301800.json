    "body": "Nobody expects much from  Dell  these days. That might turn out to be a good thing for the 38-year-old tech giant.<br />Dell is one of only six U.S.-listed tech companies currently generating more than $100 billion in annual revenue. It is also the cheapest by miles, trading at less than six times forward earnings compared with the 20 times averaged by  Apple ,   Microsoft  and the parent companies of Google and Facebook ( Amazon  remains an outlier at 65 times.). Dell now even sports a substantial discount to close rival  HP  as news of a sizable investment by famed value investor  Berkshire Hathaway  has spared that company from much of the brutal tech selloff that has ensued since. HP’s shares have lost only 1% since Berkshire’s stake was reported in a securities filing early last month while Dell’s have tumbled 15% in that time."
