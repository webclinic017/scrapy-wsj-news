    "body": "During the past decade, a critique of neoliberalism has become widespread in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party. During the 1970s, the argument goes, many Democrats espoused the pro-market, antigovernment views long associated with opposition to the New Deal and the modern welfare state. In the name of efficiency, growth and lower prices, the Carter administration deregulated airlines, trucking and other sectors. The Clinton administration espoused free trade and the unfettered flow of capital across national boundaries. In response to the Great Recession, President Obama’s economic advisers focused on the health of giant banks and tolerated a grindingly slow recovery.<br />The problem, critics allege, is that these policies ignore disadvantaged Americans who do not benefit from broad market-driven policies. Markets, they say, are indifferent to equitable outcomes. The focus on aggregate growth comes at the expense of fairness, which requires benefits and opportunities targeted to marginalized groups. Through regulations and wealth transfers, government must lean against markets to achieve acceptable results."
