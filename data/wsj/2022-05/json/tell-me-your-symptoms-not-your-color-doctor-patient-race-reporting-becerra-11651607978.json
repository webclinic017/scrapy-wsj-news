    "body": "I’ve never had a patient ask about my race in my 24 years of practicing medicine. But the Biden administration wants me to fixate on the race of my patients. The Health and Human Services Department’s so-called antiracism plan attempts to inject identity politics into the doctor-patient relationship. This policy was in the news last week when Secretary Xavier Becerra denied that HHS had “antiracism policies” and attributed a lawmaker’s question about it to “mis- and disinformation.”<br />I know better. In February a colleague told me there was a new way to boost my Medicare reimbursement rate. I specialize in long-term care for people in nursing homes, and many of my roughly 300 patients are on Medicare. I did some digging and discovered that to get the bonus, I’d have to embrace ideas wholly at odds with my oaths as a doctor."
