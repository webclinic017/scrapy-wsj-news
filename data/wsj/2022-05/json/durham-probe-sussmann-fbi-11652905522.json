    "body": "In “John Durham Goes to Court” (Potomac Watch, May 13), Kimberley Strassel writes that “it doesn’t much matter” if a judge’s rulings help Mr. Durham convict Clinton lawyer Michael Sussmann. “Mr. Durham has already accomplished his far bigger goal with this narrow indictment,” she adds. “He’s put every sleazy collusion player in the hot seat, with ramifications beyond the courtroom.”<br />Since when does the Justice Department indict people to further bigger political goals outside the courtroom? Should the many investigations being led by Democrats indict Donald Trump and others to achieve a “far bigger goal”? Perhaps to protect the nation from someone who has rejected the legal processes by which elections are decided?"
