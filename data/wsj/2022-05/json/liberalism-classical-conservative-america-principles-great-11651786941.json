    "body": "To make America great again, we must know what made her great the first time. Tunku Varadarajan, summarizing the views of John Cogan and Kevin Warsh (“America Needs a Return to First Principles,” Weekend Interview, April 30), emphasizes “ideas, individuals and institutions.” But the answer is simpler and more profound: liberalism. The secret to U.S. success is what Adam Smith called “the obvious and simple system of natural liberty.”<br />Liberalism here doesn’t mean the left side of our political spectrum. It is a political philosophy that respects human persons, detests institutional coercion and honors the rule of law. This means a politics of minimal government, an economics of free enterprise and a civil society of engaged and conscientious citizens."
