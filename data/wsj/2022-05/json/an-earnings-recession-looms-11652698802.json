    "body": "It is too early to start worrying about a recession. Worrying about an earnings recession is a different matter.<br />Economic recessions don’t occur all that often. Since 1948 there have only been a dozen of them, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research’s business cycle dating committee (the accepted arbiter of U.S. economic expansions and contractions), and in recent decades they have become less frequent. This isn’t to say that the country won’t experience another recession eventually, but with the Federal Reserve only recently moving to start tightening policy, and with the job market strong and household balance sheets in good shape, it might not come soon."
