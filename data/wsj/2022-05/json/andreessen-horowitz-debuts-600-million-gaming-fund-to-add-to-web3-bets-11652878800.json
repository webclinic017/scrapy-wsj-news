    "body": "Silicon Valley  venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz debuted a $600 million fund dedicated to gaming startups, stepping up its bets on so-called Web3 technology just as a broader market decline underscores the volatility of the cryptocurrency-based sector.<br />The venture firm, known as a16z, said Wednesday the fund is its first dedicated to the games industry, pointing to the billions of dollars in annual revenue that hit games such as “Fortnite” and “Minecraft” generate. The fund extends a16z’s yearslong practice of backing gaming startups and builds on its strategy to deploy billions of dollars into Web3 technologies. Web3 refers to a new iteration of the internet, with products and apps that are built on the blockchain, include the exchange of cryptocurrencies or tokens, and at times are housed in a virtual world, dubbed the metaverse."
