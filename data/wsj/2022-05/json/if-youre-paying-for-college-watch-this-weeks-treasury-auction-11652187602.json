    "body": "College students and their families should keep an eye on the Treasury Department’s government-bond auction this week. It could influence their finances for years to come.<br />The auction, scheduled for Wednesday, will be the main determinant of the interest rate on new federal student loans. Because bond yields have soared this year, that rate is likely to be much higher than the last time these student-loan rates were set a year ago."
