    "body": "Escapism is paying off well for  Disney ,  though the entertainment giant itself can’t fully break free from the world that it inhabits.<br />Disney’s fiscal second-quarter results posted Wednesday afternoon topped Wall Street’s estimates in key business areas such as streaming, domestic theme parks and television advertising. Revenue for the fiscal second quarter ended April 2 rose 23% year over year to $19.3 billion, with operating income surging 50% to $3.7 billion. The company added 7.9 million subscribers to its Disney+ streaming service, which was 52% more than analysts had projected, while domestic theme-park revenue of $4.9 billion nearly equaled the prepandemic peak for that segment."
