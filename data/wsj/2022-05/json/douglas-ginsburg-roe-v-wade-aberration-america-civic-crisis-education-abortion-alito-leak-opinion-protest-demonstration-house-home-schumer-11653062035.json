    "body": "Washington<br />Judge Douglas Ginsburg has a passion for civics education. When the Journal was offered an interview with him three months ago, the subject seemed important but dull. By the time we meet in his chambers in Washington on May 13, it has taken on an edge. Days earlier, a few miles away in Virginia, protesters gathered outside the home of Justice Samuel Alito, author of a leaked draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that found a constitutional right to abortion. There have also been pro-Roe pickets at the residences of Chief Justice John Roberts and other conservative colleagues."
