    "body": "The U.S. Constitution’s separation of powers was meant to ensure that government power would never become concentrated in the hands of a few. But since Franklin D. Roosevelt’s threat to “pack the Court” in 1937, the federal judiciary has aided and abetted the rise of an all-powerful administrative state. The separation of powers has since dissolved to a point that would have dismayed the Framers—and should worry all Americans.<br />Now the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has taken what could be a historic step toward restoring the Constitution’s checks and balances, in the case of Jarkesy v. SEC. The Securities and Exchange Commission acts as rulemaker, prosecutor and judge for America’s securities laws. It may have a solid case for fraud against investor George Jarkesy, but the powers and perks the agency has accumulated pose the constitutional problem."
