    "body": "The economy can only go so fast without overheating. A big problem now is that nobody is sure just how fast that is.<br />Before the pandemic, the U.S. economy looked as if it had been stuck in a slow-growth mode for some time. Productivity gains—workers’ ability to get more done in a given amount of time—had diminished, while an aging population meant that the number of available workers was growing less quickly than in the past. As a result, most economists reckoned that potential gross-domestic-product growth, which measures how fast the economy can grow without inviting inflation, had fallen. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that potential growth in the decade ended in 2019 averaged 1.7% annually versus 3.1% during the 1990s."
