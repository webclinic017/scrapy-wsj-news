    "body": "Investors are painfully aware of the plunge in stock and bond markets so far in 2022. Are federal and state officials aware of the damage plunging markets will soon do to public budgets and finances? Tax revenue from capital gains looks set to fall off a cliff.<br />The Monthly Treasury Statement for April indicates that capital-gains tax revenue reached record levels in 2021. The markets are telling us capital gains will shrink dramatically in 2022. If what the statement and the markets are signaling is correct, the reversal of fortune for federal tax revenue could be as large as $250 billion. In New York, Connecticut and other states that are heavily reliant on individual income taxes for revenue, the reversal could be devastating."
