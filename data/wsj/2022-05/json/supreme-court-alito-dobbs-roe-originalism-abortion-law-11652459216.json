    "body": "Regarding “The True Originalist Answer to Roe v. Wade” (Letters, May 9): Northwestern Law Prof. Steven Calabresi’s argument that the leaked Dobbs draft embodies New Deal constitutionalism is clever but misguided. The claim fails to capture the marvel of the draft that, if finalized, would simultaneously maintain synergy with precedent and stand as one of the opinions most consistent with originalism in this century and the last one.<br />As Mr. Calabresi observes, an opinion written on an entirely clean state right after the 14th Amendment’s 1868 ratification would note that the Due Process Clause by its terms contains no substantive rights. Those instead derive from the companion Privileges and Immunities Clause."
