    "body": "Environment-conscious investors have scored a victory against dirty power in Down Under, derailing a plan by Australia’s largest power company to spin off its coal power assets—which would have helped ringfence them from activist pressure to shut down early.<br />That win shows that investors are buying into the idea that a green agenda can also be a good business strategy—even at companies still heavily reliant on dirty fuels. Whether they are really right will probably take years to prove."
