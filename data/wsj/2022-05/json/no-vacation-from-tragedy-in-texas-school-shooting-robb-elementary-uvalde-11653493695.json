    "body": "Thursday was close enough to touch—it was going to be the last day of school at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas. On Tuesday the menu for Thursday’s final lunch of the year had already been announced: a choice of “classic pepperoni pizza” or “cheesy two-cheese pizza,” fresh-cut cucumber slices, sweet diced peaches and regular or chocolate milk.<br />No more noontime meals in the cafeteria after Thursday. Summer vacation would be arriving for the second-, third- and fourth-grade students at Robb Elementary. A list of summer sports activities available to the boys and girls had been distributed to the children and their parents."
