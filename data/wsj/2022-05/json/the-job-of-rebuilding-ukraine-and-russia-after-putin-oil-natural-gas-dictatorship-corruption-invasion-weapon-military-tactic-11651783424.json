    "body": "I had a head start in understanding the need to stand up to Vladimir Putin. Russian special forces stormed my plane in Novosibirsk, Siberia, in 2003, some six months after I publicly told Mr. Putin that his government’s corruption was hindering Russia’s development. I was charged with stealing the oil my company produced and not paying corporate taxes on the supposedly stolen oil. I spent 10 years in prison.<br />Even after the invasion of Ukraine, some Western entrepreneurs and politicians publicly criticize the sanctions against the Putin regime. The West, they say, can’t meet its energy needs without Russia, and refusing to buy Russian hydrocarbons only increases their price, benefiting Mr. Putin."
