    "body": "In explaining to students why firms adopt environmental, social and corporate-governance (ESG) missions, I encourage them to think of firms as selling multiple bundled products (“Does Your Mayo Need a Mission?” Exchange, May 21). One of these is warm fuzzies—feel-good senses associated with a firm’s product. Customers like warm fuzzies and are willing to pay for them. If the cost of providing warm fuzzies in the product bundle is lower than the additional revenue they bring in, a profit-making firm provides them. Unless the firm can explain how the mission is reducing its profits, its ESG mission can be understood as business as usual. Missions that increase profits aren’t best seen as missions.<br />David Colander"
