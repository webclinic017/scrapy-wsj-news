    "body": "Special counsel John Durham’s case against Michael Sussmann is scheduled for trial on Monday. On April 25, Judge Christopher Cooper barred the government from using the bulk of the Central Intelligence Agency’s information related to Mr. Sussmann’s activities. Nonetheless, the trial should tell us plenty about the conspiracy to create the Russia-collusion narrative and its ugly spawn, Crossfire Hurricane.<br />It should also serve as a reminder of the damage Robert Mueller did to the Federal Bureau of Investigation during his 12-year tenure as its director. Later, as special counsel, Mr. Mueller was cast in the role of the principal protagonist pushing the collusion narrative, months after Mr. Sussmann’s fateful September 2016 conversation with FBI General Counsel James Baker at the bureau’s headquarters."
