    "body": "The Securities and Exchange Commission fined the investment management arm of  Bank of New York Mellon Corp .  $1.5 million for misleading claims it made about funds that use environmental and social criteria to pick stocks.<br />The SEC said Monday that BNY Mellon Investment Adviser Inc. agreed to pay the fine after regulators found that some U.S. mutual funds it managed didnâ€™t go through a quality review of environmental, social or governance factors from July 2018 to September 2021. BNY neither admitted nor denied the claims."
