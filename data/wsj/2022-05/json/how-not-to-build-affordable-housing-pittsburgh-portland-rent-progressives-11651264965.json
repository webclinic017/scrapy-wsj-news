    "body": "Bad ideas never die; they merely move to a new city. Witness Pittsburgh’s adoption of an affordable-housing rule that will lead to . . . less affordable housing.<br />On Monday the mayor signed an ordinance passed unanimously by the City Council to expand the city’s inclusionary zoning requirements. Developers building 20 or more units in the gentrifying Bloomfield and Polish Hill neighborhoods will have to set aside at least 10% for affordable housing. Under the rules, a designated studio apartment could rent for no more than $742 a month, though the average rent for one is $1,300 in Pittsburgh, according to the housing search website Rent.com."
