    "body": "D.G. Hart’s review of Mark A. Noll’s book “America’s Book: The Rise and Decline of a Bible Civilization, 1794-1911” (Bookshelf, April 27) reminds me of a related religious practice prevalent in America’s public schools from the early to mid-20th century. In the early 1960s, as a sixth-grade public-school teacher, I always began my class with the Pledge of Allegiance, followed by the Lord’s Prayer and ending with the singing of a patriotic song. This daily routine proceeded without a protest from any person or group.<br />Then, one day in 1962, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that banned prayer in public schools, I had to announce to the class that we would no longer be able to say the Lord’s Prayer. Instead, we would have a moment of silence during which, if they wished, pupils could say their own private prayers. After several days of following this new practice, a young boy quietly came to my desk and asked if I could lengthen the moment of silence. When I asked him why, he said, “I’m having trouble getting all my prayers in.”"
