    "body": "WASHINGTON—Federal regulators are investigating Elon Musk’s late disclosure last month of his sizable stake in  Twitter Inc.,  according to people familiar with the matter, a lag that allowed him to buy more stock without alerting other shareholders to his ownership.<br />The Securities and Exchange Commission is probing Mr. Musk’s tardy submission of a public form that investors must file when they buy more than 5% of a company’s shares, the people said. The disclosure functions as an early sign to shareholders and companies that a significant investor could seek to control or influence a company."
