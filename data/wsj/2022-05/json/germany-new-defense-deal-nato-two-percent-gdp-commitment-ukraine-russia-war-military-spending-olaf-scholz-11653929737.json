    "body": "One big question facing the North Atlantic alliance after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is whether Germany is serious about Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s pledge to rearm Europe’s largest country. An answer of sorts emerged Sunday evening, and allies will be somewhat reassured.<br />Mr. Scholz in late February promised rearmament after 30 years of underinvestment in the German military. The centerpiece of his “turning point” in foreign policy was a twin commitment to create a €100 billion ($108 billion) special fund for defense procurement and to spend 2% of gross domestic product on defense in line with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization goal."
