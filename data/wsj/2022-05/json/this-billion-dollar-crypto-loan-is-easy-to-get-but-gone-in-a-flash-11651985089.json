    "body": "A hacker who robbed the decentralized stablecoin platform Beanstalk in April had a powerful tool: a $1 billion loan taken out with no collateral, no proof of income and no identity verification. The loan had to be repaid in less than a second, but that was all that was needed to steal tens of millions of dollars.<br />The hacker used what is called a flash loanâ€”a cheap, instant and anonymous form of financing based on cryptocurrencies."
