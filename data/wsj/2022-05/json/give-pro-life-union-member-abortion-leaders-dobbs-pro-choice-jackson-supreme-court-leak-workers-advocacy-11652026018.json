    "body": "Instead of organizing for better working conditions, labor unions last week organized for abortion rights.<br />Responding to a leaked draft of a U.S. Supreme Court opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, hospitality union Unite Here tweeted that it would “only endorse and elect pro-choice candidates, whether those choices relate to abortion or a union.” The Association of Flight Attendants labeled the draft opinion an “attack against the majority of this country.” Teachers union president Randi Weingarten endorsed federal legislation to codify abortion rights. The new  Starbucks  baristas union tweeted: “All of us in the labor movement must fight for our abortion rights.”"
