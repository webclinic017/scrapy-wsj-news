    "body": "The likely end of Roe v. Wade is no finish line; it’s a starting gate. If the Supreme Court hands down an opinion similar to Justice Samuel Alito’s leaked draft, voters at the state level, not federal courts, will decide important questions of policy. One question lies beneath the others: Will we rise to the challenge and help children who would have been aborted but now won’t be?<br />The number of lives saved would be only a fraction of all U.S. abortions seen in recent years, which top 600,000 annually. Abortion clinics would expand their work in many states. Pill-driven abortions would likely continue to rise. Unintended pregnancies may decrease. But at a minimum we should anticipate tens of thousands of children would be born who wouldn’t have been under Roe—possibly many more."
