    "body": "Education choice is turning out to be a sharp political dividing line in many states, and one place to watch is Michigan. New evidence buttresses the case for a petition drive to overturn a veto by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.<br />Last autumn the GOP-controlled Legislature passed a Student Opportunity Scholarship Program providing up to $7,800 for private school tuition or such education expenses as tutoring. The program is mostly for lower- and middle-income families and offers dollar-for-dollar tax credits in return for scholarship donations. The total annual cost of the tax credits is capped at $500 million."
