    "body": "Natural-gas drilling has rarely been so profitable. Yet U.S. producers say they will retire debt, buy back shares and pay dividends rather than ramp-up output.<br />The pursuit of stock-boosting financial maneuvers has helped shares of  Antero Resources Corp . ,  EQT Corp .  and others shine in a down market. It also adds to concerns about low supplies and suggests higher prices ahead for the heating and power-generation fuel, which has already contributed to the sharpest inflation in four decades."
