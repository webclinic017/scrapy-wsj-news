    "body": "A $5.5 trillion bond market supporting the U.S. mortgage industry is being roiled by fears it will be hit in the Federal Reserveâ€™s battle against inflation.<br />Prices are falling for bonds backed by agency mortgage loans from government-owned lenders  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac .  That is primarily because the Fed has started raising interest rates, which hits the value of all existing fixed-rate bonds, but also because it might start selling some of its $2.7 trillion holdings of the bonds, potentially further diminishing their value."
