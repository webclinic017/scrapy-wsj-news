    "body": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has taken of late to praising legendary Chairman Paul Volcker, as a signal of his new inflation-fighting determination. But Mr. Powell put Tall Paul on hold on Wednesday as he walked back some of the hawkishness that he and his colleagues have exhibited in recent weeks.<br />The Federal Open Market Committee raised its target fed funds rate by 50 basis points, as expected. But the news is that Mr. Powell signaled the Fed may not need to be as aggressive to counter inflation as markets had thought."
