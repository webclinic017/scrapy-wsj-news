    "body": "President Biden on Tuesday delivered the first salvo of his re-engineered midterm message. Declaring that fighting inflation will be “my top domestic priority,” he said the two leading causes of rising prices are “a one-in-a-century pandemic” and “Mr. Putin’s war in Ukraine.” But that isn’t accurate.<br />Inflation’s principal cause is too much government spending—specifically, last year’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. President Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, Larry Summers, warned then that “there was a chance” its passage “will set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation.” He was right, and we’re all paying higher prices as a result."
