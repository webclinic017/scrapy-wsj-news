    "body": "Minneapolis<br />Jon Lundberg didn’t want to leave the city. He and his wife, Aimee, knew their North Minneapolis neighbors and were active in their church. Their Jordan neighborhood could be rough, but Mr. Lundberg believed living there was worthwhile because of the service his family gave to the community. Everything changed in late May 2020. That’s when the shooting started."
