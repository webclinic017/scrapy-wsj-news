    "body": "Not too many years ago Colombia had defeated narco-left guerrillas and seemed headed for stable prosperity. But after Sunday’s first round in the presidential election, the country of 51 million is tilting toward the left-wing populism that has harmed so many Latin nations.<br />Former M-19 guerrilla Gustavo Petro finished first with 40% of the vote, short of the majority required to avoid a runoff on June 19. His opponent will be Rodolfo Hernández, a successful businessman and former mayor of Bucaramanga (2016-2019), who finished second with 28%. An eccentric 77-year-old with little fixed ideology, Mr. Hernández surged late in the race with the skillful use of TikTok while campaigning as an outsider against corrupt elites."
