    "body": "In “Putin Really May Break the Nuclear Taboo” (Declarations, April 30), Peggy Noonan argues persuasively that we need to take Vladimir Putin’s threats seriously. Americans’ assumptions about the impossibility of deploying nuclear weapons (“That won’t happen! It has never happened!”) are incorrect.<br />Ms. Noonan reaches this conclusion by looking at the poor Russian military performance in Ukraine and at Mr. Putin’s nihilistic character. May I suggest a third, historical factor? Mr. Putin is a Soviet man; he lived his first 39 years in the Soviet Union, rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the KGB foreign intelligence and publicly rued the U.S.S.R.’s demise. He was shaped by and continues to reflect Soviet doctrines."
