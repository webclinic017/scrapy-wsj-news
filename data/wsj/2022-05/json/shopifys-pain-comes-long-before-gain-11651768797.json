    "body": "Shopify  picked a tough time to go into investment mode.<br />The Canadian e-commerce upstart unveiled a bold plan earlier this year to build up its own logistics network to help its merchant partners better compete against  Amazon.com .  That plan involved a massive boost to the company’s annual capital expenditures. The next step was unveiled Thursday morning as part of Shopify’s first-quarter results—the $2.1 billion acquisition of fulfillment technology provider Deliverr. Shopify’s largest prior acquisition was the $450 million pickup of 6 River Systems in 2019."
