    "body": "The Biden administration is reportedly considering expanding its efforts at targeted student debt forgiveness into a broader policy whereby “at least” $10,000 (some have advocated for up to $50,000) in student loans per borrower, possibly subject to an annual income cap, would be eligible for cancellation.<br />There is a rough consensus that rising levels of student-loan debt are a problem, and proponents of debt relief note the aggregate amount outstanding has increased by roughly two-thirds over the past 10 years to a total of some $1.7 trillion. Largely overlooked in the debate are changes made to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 2005, which materially increased the difficulty of discharging student loans in bankruptcy."
