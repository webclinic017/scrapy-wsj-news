    "body": "OPEC and its allies stuck to a small, planned increase in oil production on Thursday, as windfall revenue from high crude prices boosts the economies of Saudi Arabia and other producers while providing a buffer to Russia against Western sanctions.<br />In its third meeting since Russia invaded Ukraine, sending oil prices above $100 a barrel for the first time in eight years, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a coalition of Moscow-led oil producers said they agreed to continue raising their collective production by 432,000 barrels a day."
