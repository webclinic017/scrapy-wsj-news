    "body": "‘This was pure evil,” said Erie County Sheriff John Garcia in an apt summary of the mass murder at a supermarket in Buffalo that appears to be racially motivated. The alleged shooter, 18-year-old Payton Gendron, is another young man possessed by inexplicable hatred.<br />We’ll learn more about the shooter’s motives and mindset, but it’s worth noting a report in the Buffalo News that an official in the school Mr. Gendron attended in Conklin, N.Y., said he had spoken of wanting to go on a shooting spree. He fits the profile of other young men who become mass shooters at an age when mental illness often strikes. Keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill isn’t easy, but it’s one form of gun control that would do some good."
