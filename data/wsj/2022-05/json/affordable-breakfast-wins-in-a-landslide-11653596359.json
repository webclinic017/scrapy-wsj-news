    "body": "One finds no shortage of depressing and even heartbreaking news these days. But today there’s also reason to hope that finally, the era of hyper-politicized corporate and investment management just might be drawing to a close.<br />The great news for U.S. consumers is that the shareholders of the  McDonald ’s  Corporation have resoundingly rejected financier Carl  Icahn ’s  effort to make restaurant customers pay to soothe his feelings about animals.
