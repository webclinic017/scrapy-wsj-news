    "body": "KPMG LLP agreed to pay a fine after the Financial Reporting Council found shortfalls in its audit of  Rolls-Royce Holdings  PLC, the British jet engine and car manufacturer that settled bribery allegations in 2017.<br />The U.K. audit regulator on Tuesday said it imposed sanctions of £3.4 million—equivalent to $4.2 million—against the professional-services firm and £112,500 against audit partner Anthony Sykes. The investigation, which the FRC announced in 2017, focused on KPMG’s audits of Rolls-Royce for the years ended Dec. 31, 2010, through Dec. 31, 2013. The FRC found no breaches of conduct in the audits spanning 2011 to 2013."
