    "body": "YOU COULD THINK OF this dish as stuffed-mushroom adjacent, but it’s leaner, brighter and works as a meal (along with a salad, perhaps). In her second Slow Food Fast recipe, Melissa Rodriguez grills big, frilly maitakes and dresses them with the classic Italian-style stuffed-mushroom elements—bread, onions, garlic, herbs—plus a few surprises.<br />While any large mushroom will work here, Ms. Rodriguez likes the way maitakes turn tender and meaty within as the edges crisp. They take well to her sharp vinaigrette made with rendered bits of soppressata. Spoon it on as soon as the mushrooms come off the grill and they’ll drink it up. Olive-oil-fried croutons lend texture, and marjoram provides a fresh, aromatic note."
