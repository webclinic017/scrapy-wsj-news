    "body": "Housing might have been staggered a bit by higher rates but hasnâ€™t really taken it on the chin. It could be just a matter of time.<br />This has been an interesting year so far for the housing market, to say the least. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has risen to 5.25% from 3.1% at the end of December, according to  Freddie Mac ,  making homes much harder to afford. Sales have slowed, with the National Association of Realtors on Thursday reporting that there were 5.61 million previously-owned, or existing, homes sold in April, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. That compares with a monthly average of 6.12 million over the course of last year."
