    "body": "U.S. stocks could well bounce back from their awful start to the year. How they do in the longer run is another matter.<br />Heading into 2022, expectations were great. A Natixis survey of individual investors in 24 countries in 2021 showed U.S. investors had the highest projections of the group at 17.5% annual returns going forward. The difference between that and historical experience is stark: Compared with long-term annual U.S. stock returns of around 9.8%, a $10,000 investment would grow to about $50,000 in 10 years instead of $25,000. But even stocksâ€™ more restrained long-run returns seem aspirational now."
