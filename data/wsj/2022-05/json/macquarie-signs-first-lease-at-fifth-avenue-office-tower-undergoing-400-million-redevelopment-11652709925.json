    "body": "Australian financial-services company  Macquarie Group  signed the first lease at a new Midtown Manhattan redevelopment of the office tower that gained global attention during the Trump administration because it was owned at the time by the family of senior Trump aide Jared Kushner.<br />The 39-story building, which has changed its name from 666 Fifth Ave. to 660 Fifth Ave., is being overhauled in a $400 million redevelopment by  Brookfield Asset Management  which purchased a long-term lease of the property from the Kushners in 2018. Macquarie is leasing 220,000 of the buildingâ€™s 1.25 million square feet of office lease for its Americas regional headquarters, now located at another Midtown building a few blocks away."
