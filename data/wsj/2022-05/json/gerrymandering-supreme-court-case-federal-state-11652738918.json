    "body": "In “How to Avert a 2024 Election Disaster in 2023” (op-ed, April 25), David Rivkin Jr. and Andrew Grossman argue that, to “avoid a constitutional crisis,” the U.S. Supreme Court should hold that state courts may not “rely on state constitutions or their own judicial power to alter either congressional redistricting maps or voting rules in federal elections.”<br />Such a cure would be more dangerous than the alleged disease. Compliance with constitutional rights cannot be subject to the pleasure of the majority. Rather than wall off such matters from state-court review, the Supreme Court could review state-court decisions that cross the line from interpreting state law to writing law."
