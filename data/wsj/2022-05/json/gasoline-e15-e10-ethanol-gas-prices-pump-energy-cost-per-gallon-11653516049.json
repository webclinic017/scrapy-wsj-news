    "body": "A letter (May 10) questions the savings from E15 gasoline (gasoline blended with 15% ethanol) versus mainstream E10 gasoline, claiming that reductions in miles per gallon with E15 will exceed cost savings. I have studied the impact of fuel composition on engine operation for decades. Itâ€™s correct that E15 contains less energy than E10, around 1.5% less. But assuming gasoline at $4 a gallon, this reduction in energy would be overcome by cost reduction when E15 gasoline costs 6 cents or more per gallon less than E10.<br />Savings with E15 generally far exceed 6 cents a gallon compared with E10, producing a welcome reduction in operating cost per mile for consumers. Moreover, the 1.5% penalty with E15 is a worst-case scenario. Octane enhancement with E15 coupled with reduced intake temperature (heat of vaporization) typically offsets some of the 1.5% reduction in fuel economy. Finally, energy security from an American homegrown fuel, coupled with greenhouse-gas-emissions reductions, further support E15 as the preferred choice."
