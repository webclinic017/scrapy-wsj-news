    "body": "Snap Inc.<br />Snap spooked tech investors with a warning Monday. The maker of Snapchat​said its second-quarter revenue and adjusted pretax earnings would be lower than it expected, as the social-media company feels the sting of disruptions in the digital ad market. Worries of slowdowns in online advertising rippled to other tech stocks, weighing on shares of  Meta Platforms Inc.  and  Alphabet Inc.  Snap shares plunged 43% Tuesday."
