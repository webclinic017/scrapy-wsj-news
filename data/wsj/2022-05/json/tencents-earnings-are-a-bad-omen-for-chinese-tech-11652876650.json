    "body": "A regulatory crackdown, a slowing Chinese economy and a nasty post-Covid hangover added up to the weakest revenue growth ever for China’s most valuable internet company last quarter. The stock has been hammered over the past 18 months. Shares could remain on life support for quite a while.<br />Tencent’s revenue for the quarter ending in March was flat compared with a year earlier and missed consensus estimates on S&P Global Market Intelligence. Margins are sliding, too: Adjusted operating profit for the quarter fell 15% year over year."
