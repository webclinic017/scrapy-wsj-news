    "body": "Regarding Marlo Oaks’s op-ed “S&P Hits U.S. States With Politicized Credit Scores” (May 9): The American Petroleum Institute’s members have been leaders on tracking progress on environmental, social and corporate governance issues (ESG) for decades. Yet we share some concerns over how it may be misapplied. Mr. Oaks writes that S&P’s ESG metrics, which determine credit ratings for state and local governments, are tilted against places that produce natural gas and oil—jeopardizing U.S. energy leadership when it’s most desired.<br />It’s misguided to deploy metrics that undervalue our industry’s progress and infringe on the role of markets to determine America’s best energy path. Supply and demand have been driven lately by Russian aggression and the reaction to the pandemic. How companies and governments react isn’t tied to any one metric."
