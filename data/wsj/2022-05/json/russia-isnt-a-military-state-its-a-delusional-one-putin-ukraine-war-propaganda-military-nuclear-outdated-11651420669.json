    "body": "When Russian tanks were shelling the nuclear core at the Zaporozhskaya power plant with live rounds, not all of the shells exploded because they were too old and decrepit. This story, told to me by Piotr Kotin, head of the company that owns the plant, is a metaphor for Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine.<br />The current Russian army is a replica of Joseph Stalin’s Red Army, designed to saturate minefields with bodies. During World War II, while U.S. generals were parachuting onto battlefields with their troops and sharing their hardships, Soviet generals stayed far from the front and sent wave after wave of doomed conscripts against impregnable defenses. So it is no surprise that their successors asked troops under their command to dig trenches in the highly radioactive soil of Chernobyl and sent units into the meat grinder of Chornobaivka."
