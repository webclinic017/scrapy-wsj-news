    "body": "Companies that rise with the help of political subsidies can also fall by them. Behold how electric vehicle manufacturer  Rivian â€™s  high-flying stock is crashing to earth.<br />Rivian shares fell another 20.88% on Monday to $22.78 after its stock lockup period for early investors expired. The EV startup went public in November with a $66.5 billion valuation and shares at $78. Its stock price soon surged to $172 amid investor euphoria fed by free credit and expectations that Congress would sweeten electric vehicle subsidies."
