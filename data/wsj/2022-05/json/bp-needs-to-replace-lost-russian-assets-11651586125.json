    "body": "BP  shareholders seem to be confident that the loss of its big Russian assets won’t knock the company off its stride. That leaves the transitioning oil-and-gas giant with a lot of work to do.<br />The company outlined stellar first-quarter results Tuesday, boosted by “exceptional” oil-and-gas trading, strong refining margins and high commodity prices. The results were marred only by one not-so-small matter: the $25.5 billion pre-announced write off of its stake in Russian oil giant  Rosneft  and other assets in the country."
