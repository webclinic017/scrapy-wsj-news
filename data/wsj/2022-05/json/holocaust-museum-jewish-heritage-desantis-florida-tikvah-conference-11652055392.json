    "body": "Elliott Abrams and Eric Cohen’s op-ed “Persona Non Grata at a Holocaust Memorial” (May 6) misstates the decision of the Museum of Jewish Heritage to decline to host the Tikvah Fund’s conference. This was not about banning or canceling Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a proposed speaker at the event. Messrs. Abrams and Cohen leave out that Tikvah, their organization, took months to provide details about its event, and when it finally did, it was clear it would have been too disruptive for the museum.<br />Tikvah reached out in January about renting our space. For months we sought details. Our charter does not allow rentals for purely political or religious reasons, and this is made clear to anyone who requests to rent our space. In late April, when Tikvah came back to us, it presented a plan that would have required using more of our public space and resources—and requested additional police security—that presented logistical challenges on what is normally our busiest day. The museum must consider the safety of visitors and staff."
