    "body": "In 2018, Queen Elizabeth II and Anna Wintour were photographed laughing in the front row of a Richard Quinn fashion show in London—just two rather powerful grannies chatting it up. For the longest-reigning British monarch, now 96, this was a rare fashion-week outing, but for the longest-reigning editor-in-chief of American Vogue, now 72, it was business as usual. Vogue’s top editor since 1988 and the global chief content officer of Condé Nast since 2020, Ms. Wintour is no stranger to the lonely, queenlike feeling of being at the top. With typical understatement, she later told former Vanity Fair editor and sometime rival Tina Brown that at the show, she and the Queen discussed “how long we’ve both been in our jobs.”<br />Like the Queen, part of Ms. Wintour’s status as an object of fascination lies in her pure longevity. From last night’s starry “Gilded-Age”–themed Met Gala (to which she wore a tiara that’s a family heirloom), which she’s hosted since 1995, to her continual promotions at notoriously fickle Condé Nast amidst decades of cultural shifts, she is just as powerful as ever. “Anna,” a biography by journalist Amy Odell which is out today from Gallery Books, seeks to explain her omnipotence."
