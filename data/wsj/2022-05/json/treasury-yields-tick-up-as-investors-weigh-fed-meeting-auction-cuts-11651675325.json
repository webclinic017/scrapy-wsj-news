    "body": "U.S. Treasury yields fell Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said central bank officials weren’t giving serious thought to raising short-term rates by more than half-a-percentage point in upcoming meetings.<br />Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, climbed early Wednesday and initially clung to gains after the Fed approved a rare half-percentage-point interest rate increase as it tries to fight inflation running at its highest level in decades. They dropped, however, when Mr. Powell said in a press conference that a future rate increase of three quarters of a percentage point wasn’t something that the Fed was actively considering. More half point increases were on the table for the next couple of meetings, he said."
