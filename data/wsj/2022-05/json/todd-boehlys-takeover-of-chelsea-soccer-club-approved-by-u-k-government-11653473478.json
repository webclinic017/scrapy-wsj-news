    "body": "The U.K. government signed off on a deal to sell soccer club Chelsea FC for £4.25 billion, equivalent to around $5.3 billion, to a group led by Los Angeles Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly.<br />The U.K. Premier League team previously belonged to Roman Abramovich, a Russian oligarch who was sanctioned in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. After Mr. Boehly’s consortium struck a deal with Mr. Abramovich, the U.K. government had to sign off on the transaction to ensure it complied with sanctions restrictions."
