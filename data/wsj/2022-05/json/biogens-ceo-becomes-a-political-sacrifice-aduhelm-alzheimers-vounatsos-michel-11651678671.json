    "body": "Investors toasted  Biogen  CEO Michel Vounatsos last June after the Food and Drug Administration approved the company’s Alzheimer’s monoclonal antibody, Aduhelm—the first treatment that has been shown to slow progression of the debilitating disease. It was expected to become a blockbuster in short order.<br />But those hopes were dashed as Aduhelm came under political attack, culminating in the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Service’s refusal last month to pay for it outside of clinical trials. Most patients will have to pay $28,200 a year out of pocket."
