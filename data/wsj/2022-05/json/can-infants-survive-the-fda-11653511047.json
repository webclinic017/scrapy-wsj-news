    "body": "This column recently called on the Food and Drug Administration to explain how the scientific method required shutting down a baby formula factory where government tests failed to establish a link to infant illnesses—and then agreeing the factory should reopen the moment the resulting shortage generated significant headlines.<br />The  Abbott Laboratories  plant will soon reopen but the shortage continues. Today’s virtual appearance by FDA Commissioner Robert Califf at a House hearing is virtually certain to inspire new doubts about the Biden FDA’s management method."
