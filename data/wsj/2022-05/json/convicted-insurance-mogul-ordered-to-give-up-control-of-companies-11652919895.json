    "body": "A North Carolina court has ordered convicted insurance mogul Greg Lindberg to turn over control of hundreds of his private companies to a special board in an effort to salvage four financially troubled insurers that have been under regulatory supervision since 2019.<br />The court order concluded that Mr. Lindberg committed fraud in failing to abide by a 2019 agreement under which North Carolinaâ€™s insurance department seized control of the insurers from Mr. Lindberg."
