    "body": "Shell ’s  messaging that the energy industry faces highly uncertain times seems aimed at politicians and consumers. But it is getting through more clearly to investors.<br />High commodity prices and war-linked volatility helped the company generate record net profits and $14.8 billion in cash flow from operations in the first quarter. Shell paid down debt, raised dividends and increased expectations for shareholder returns later this year. The stock rose 3.8% in European trading."
