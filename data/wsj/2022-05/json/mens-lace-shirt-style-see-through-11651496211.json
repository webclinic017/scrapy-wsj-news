    "body": "In “The Northman,” director Robert Eggers’s recently released Viking epic, Prince Amleth spends a chunk of the film’s two-plus hours shirtless. As the movie takes place in the early 10th century, the choice is in keeping with history. But it also seems intended to flaunt actor Alexander Skarsgård’s six-pack. In nearly every fight scene, the would-be king looks prepared for the CrossFit Games, or for having his trapezii captured in marble. (Mr. Skarsgård’s trainer told “Variety” that the actor gained 20 pounds of muscle for the role.)<br />If he could time travel into a department store today—and be convinced to put a shirt on—the immodest Amleth might like his options: men’s fashion has crossed into the leave-nothing-to-the-imagination era."
