    "body": "As Georgians go to the polls on Tuesday, they have a clear choice: The Peach State can re-elect Gov. Brian Kemp, a leader of integrity, or replace him with an opportunistic politician, either Democrat Stacey Abrams or Republican David Perdue. In 2020 Georgia was at the center of the battle over which party would control the Senate and White House. In 2022 the stakes may be even higher. Georgians can send a clear message that voters will reward honest leadership and reject unprincipled politicians.<br />Over the past four years, Gov. Kemp has provided strong leadership in challenging times. We donâ€™t approach every issue the same way, but I respect that he shoots straight, listens to his constituents and puts their needs first."
