    "body": "Unilever  has similar problems to those  Procter & Gamble  faced four years ago, and now has the same activist investor on its board. But times otherwise have moved on.<br />On Tuesday, Unilever said Trian Partners founder Nelson Peltz will take a seat on the company’s board of directors from July. After months of speculation that the activist had bought shares in Unilever, the company confirmed that his hedge fund owns a 1.5% stake, currently valued at around $1.6 billion. Mr. Peltz will join Unilever’s compensation committee and may want changes to pay incentives. At P&G, he criticized targets that rewarded top executives for sales growth that was below the industry average."
