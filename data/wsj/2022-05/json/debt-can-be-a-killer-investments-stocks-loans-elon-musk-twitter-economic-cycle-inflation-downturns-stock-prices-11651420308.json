    "body": "The arrest last week of the founder of the investment firm Archegos, charged with securities fraud, is a great reminder of hidden debt. In March 2021, Archegos was overleveraged, allegedly hiding its debt from Wall Street firms as it used funky “total-return swaps” to manipulate stock prices. The inevitable collapse destroyed $100 billion in stock value. (Archegos’s lawyers have denied the allegations.) Separately, supply-chain financier Greensill used what Fitch described as a “hidden debt loophole” and collapsed around the same time.<br />Are there more of these out there? I ask because we’re in the most dangerous part of the economic cycle. Interest rates are rising to combat inflation, and there could be all sorts of leverage we don’t know about. There always is. A slowdown (and especially a recession) would expose these hidden horrors. In 2018 this column argued that “in downturns, equity hurts but debt kills.” We’re about to find out if that’s still true."
