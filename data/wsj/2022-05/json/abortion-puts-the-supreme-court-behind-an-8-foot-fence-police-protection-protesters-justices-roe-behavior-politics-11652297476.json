    "body": "The Supreme Court of the United States—from its first meeting in February 1790 through the Civil War, two world wars and the battle for civil rights—has never been protected by an 8-foot wire fence. It is now. On Monday the Senate voted unanimously to extend police protection to the justices’ immediate family. What has happened to us?<br />Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts stood outside the court last week shouting herself hoarse in rage over the prospect of the court overturning 1973’s abortion decision in Roe v. Wade. Since the weekend protesters filled streets outside the homes of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Samuel Alito."
