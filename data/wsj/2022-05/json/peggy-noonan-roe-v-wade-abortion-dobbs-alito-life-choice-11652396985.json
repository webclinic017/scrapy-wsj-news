    "body": "In “The End of Roe Will Be Good for America” (Declarations, May 7), Peggy Noonan argues that the acrimony caused by Roe v. Wade (1973) will be lessened if decisions are left to voters in the states. It isn’t clear why changing the venue of the decision will help, but once you decide to let people vote on whether to legalize abortion, why not let each woman be sovereign? Let each woman decide for herself whether she supports abortion.<br />Ruth Gass"
