    "body": "Companies have ample reason to keep boosting their capital spending, but at the moment they might also be facing a big stumbling block: The stock market.<br />Figuring out ways to run operations more efficiently almost always seems like a good idea, but lately the potential payoff has been especially high. A tight U.S. job market has made it harder for companies to bring on new workers and driven up labor costs. Investments in new plants and equipment can make existing employees more productive, which eases hiring strains, reduces labor-cost pressure and preserves profit margins."
