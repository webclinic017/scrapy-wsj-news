    "body": "Beijing’s Covid lockdowns are an economic danger to China and everyone else, and the Communist Party seems to know it. Witness recent, belated attempts to pump up economic growth amid the zero-Covid policy disaster.<br />Large swathes of China have been under some form of lockdown in recent months. That includes Shanghai, a crucial commercial hub, which has yet to emerge from restrictions after a month. The government shows little sign of recalibrating even as other countries abandon lockdowns in favor of learning to live with the virus."
