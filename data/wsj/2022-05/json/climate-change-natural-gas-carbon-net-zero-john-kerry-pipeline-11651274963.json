    "body": "John Kerry and the Democrats call for net-zero emissions but seem not to realize their policies prevent an economically viable transition (“John Kerry Responds on Natural Gas’s Future,” Letters, April 26).<br />Mr. Kerry states that natural gas is a central component in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions, which makes one wonder why his colleagues are fighting off natural-gas pipelines. Similarly, he writes of stopping flaring without mentioning that it is occurring in the U.S. because the efforts of environmentalists and politicians have led to a lack of new pipelines."
