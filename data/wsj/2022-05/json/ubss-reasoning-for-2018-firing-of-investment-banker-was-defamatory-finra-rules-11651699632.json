    "body": "UBS Group AG’s  rationale for the 2018 firing of a senior investment banker was defamatory and should be expunged from his record, according to an arbitration ruling issued this week.<br />The ruling, released Monday by a panel of arbitrators for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, holds that the reason for the termination of James Boland should be changed to “voluntary” and the explanation should be removed entirely."
