    "body": "What chip shortage?<br />For two years running now, the global semiconductor industry hasn’t been able to produce enough chips to meet demand. But that strain isn’t spread equally across the sector. Chip makers that use older production processes for components that go in things such as cars and industrial equipment are under the most pressure. Two of those— ON Semiconductor  and  NXP Semiconductors —reported year over year revenue growth of 31% and 22% in their respective first-quarter reports this week. But both also said they expect to be supply-constrained for the rest of this year and into next. Analyst Christopher Rolland of Susquehanna says NXP “could potentially ship multiples of revenue if available given their hefty backlog.”"
