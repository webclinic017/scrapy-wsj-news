    "body": "Nurses are the backbone of the healthcare system, and their fight to be compensated fairly for their work isn’t the reason for increased healthcare costs (“Hospital Chains Aim to Boost Prices to Offset Nurses’ Pay,” Page One, May 9). The major issues include lack of choice in health insurance—which most Americans receive through an employer—and a reactive approach to healthcare. It costs exceedingly more to have open-heart surgery and an extended stay in the hospital than it does to work to prevent a heart attack.<br />If hospitals want to cut costs, they should focus on the bloated compensation packages that many hospital CEOs receive instead of targeting nurses’ wages."
