    "body": "Less than a year after  Didi Global Inc.  listed its shares in the U.S., the Chinese ride-hailing company said its shareholders approved its plan to delist from the New York Stock Exchange, concluding a regulatory roller-coaster ride that sent its market value plummeting.<br />The move will allow the company to move forward after it was caught in Beijing’s campaign to tighten its grip on China’s tech giants and their troves of data. Didi had told shareholders it needed to delist before it can resolve a cybersecurity probe in China."
