    "body": "Marcus Henley and Sergio Saravia don’t live in New York City, but local lawmakers there may put them out of business. If the city’s ban on the sale of foie gras takes effect on Nov. 25, Messrs. Henley and Saravia fear they’ll lose the duck farms they’ve worked for much of their lives in upstate Sullivan County. They plan to file a lawsuit to save their businesses.<br />“If you read the law and you read the legislative history behind it, it was crystal clear that what the City Council was really trying to do was stop a farming practice that it considered objectionable,” Ed Phillips, the farmers’ lawyer, says in a phone interview. Making foie gras requires a force-feeding process, which causes liver expansion similar to what wild ducks undergo before migration but on a greater scale. Messrs. Henley and Saravia feed their birds a gradually increasing liquid diet through a 6-inch rubber tube about half an inch wide. The process is lawful, and they contend it is humane and the birds suffer no ill effects."
