    "body": "When Florida Republicans approved a bill to strip Walt  Disney Co.  of its special taxing privileges in April amid controversy over how gender and sexuality are taught in schools, they failed to address a key question: Who is responsible for paying back nearly $1 billion in municipal debt used to build roads, walkways and other infrastructure around Disney World?<br />Florida law dictates the bondholders must be paid even if Disney’s special taxing district, known as Reedy Creek, is dissolved. A separate law creating Reedy Creek promised bondholders the state wouldn’t interfere with its tax collections. One of the bill’s sponsors is now considering re-establishing a watered-down version of Reedy Creek to unwind the legal mess."
