    "body": "Money appears to have been burning a hole in  Broadcom ’s  pocket. A lot of money.<br />The hyper-acquisitive chip company first set its sights on the software market in 2018 with its surprise $18.9 billion acquisition of CA Technologies. But its growth strategy turned more expensive as software valuations soared. The S&P 500 Software & Services Group rose by 120% between the time of the CA deal and the index’s peak late last year—nearly twice the S&P 500’s gain during that time. A run at privately held SAS Institute last year came to naught as employees, in fear of losing their perk-heavy culture, revolted against the reported deal."
