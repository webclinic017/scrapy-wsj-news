    "body": "I think we give John Locke too much credit (“John Locke’s Lesson for the Taliban” by Mustafa Aykol, Houses of Worship, May 13). The actual genius of Locke was that he took the political ideas of the Puritans and repackaged them for broader consumption. He shifted the weight of their arguments from biblical revelation to reason.<br />Freedom of conscience was embedded in Protestantism from the beginning when Martin Luther stood before the Imperial Diet of Worms and said, “Unless I am convinced by Scripture and plain reason—I do not accept the authority of popes and councils, for they have contradicted each other—my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and I will not recant anything, for to go against conscience is neither right nor safe. God help me.” He later followed this up with strong statements against the coercion of belief in state and church. The early magisterial Reformation, however, was not always consistent with its founding principles. It wasn’t until believer’s baptism emerged that liberty of conscience received full expression."
