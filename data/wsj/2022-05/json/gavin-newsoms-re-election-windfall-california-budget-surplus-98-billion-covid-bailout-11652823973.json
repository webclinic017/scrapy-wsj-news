    "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom must feel like he won the lottery, and in a political sense he has. A year ago he and other Democratic Governors were begging for a federal bailout. Last week he announced a $98 billion surplus, which he wants to spend as if, well, there's an election coming.<br />Mr. Newsom revealed the giant surplus in his updated $301 billion budget plan. State coffers have swelled by 40% during the pandemic thanks to Congress’s Covid spending and a capital-gains revenue gusher from surging asset prices. California’s surplus alone is bigger than the budget of every state besides Texas, Florida and New York."
