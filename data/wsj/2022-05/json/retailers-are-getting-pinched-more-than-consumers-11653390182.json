    "body": "Even as higher prices make them blanch, Americans will probably keep on spending. Unfortunately for many retailers, however, less of it could be on the wares that grace their aisles.<br />Several rough earnings reports from major retailers have made investors question the health of the U.S. consumer and raised worries that the next recession could be right around the corner. Walmart, for example, said last week that some customers have traded down to half-gallon milk from full gallons. It also said shoppers were choosing private label deli, lunch meat, bacon and dairy brands. Its results, as well as those of rival Target, spooked investors enough that their shares had their biggest plunges since the 1987 stock-market crash."
