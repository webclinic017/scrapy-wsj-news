    "body": "Like millions of Americans, I am shocked and angered by the leaked Supreme Court opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade. This was my mother’s fight, it was my fight, and it’s my daughter’s fight. Now, sadly, my newborn granddaughter appears to have inherited it.<br />From Seneca Falls to Stonewall, New York has always led the nation in the battle for human rights, with suffrage three years before the 19th Amendment, marriage equality four years before it was recognized by the court, and legalized abortion three years before Roe."
