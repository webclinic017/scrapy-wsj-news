    "body": "Investors tuning into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s news conference Wednesday will focus on his comments about how high interest rates might rise beyond this year to combat inflation.<br />This is partly because the Fed has clearly telegraphed its plans for an aggressive ramp-up in policy tightening at this week’s two-day policy gathering, which begins Tuesday. Officials are preparing to raise rates by an unusual half percentage point and to follow that move in June with another half-point increase—and possibly more after that. They haven’t raised rates by more than a quarter percentage point at any meeting since 2000."
