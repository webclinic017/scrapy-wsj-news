    "body": "Your editorial “Europe’s Abortion Lesson” (May 9) compares the American abortion situation after Roe v. Wade is overturned with abortion laws in Europe, which were reached by democratic processes. One should remember that it was Vladimir Lenin who was the first to legalize abortion. His goal was to abolish the “bourgeois family.” The U.K., in 1967, legalized abortion under very limited conditions, but the real impetus to expand the availability of abortion came from us with Roe in 1973, not from abroad.<br />Abortion laws in Europe have changed greatly over time. In 1975 France liberalized its treatment of abortion and today has superficial restrictions after 14 weeks of pregnancy. Ireland was the last to legalize it, by referendum in 2018. Poland’s ban was passed after it left the U.S.S.R. and entered the European Union."
