    "body": "I agree with Akhil Reed Amar’s constitutional assessment of Justice Samuel Alito’s opinion on abortion and Roe v. Wade (“The End of Roe v. Wade,” Review, May 14). I agree with him that Justice Harry Blackmun’s opinion in Roe was a poorly written and poorly justified decision. I also agree with him on a woman’s right to decide.<br />Where we differ is when he claims that rights like same-sex and interracial marriage are inherently historical rights. Although I support these rights, they are by no means inherently historical. Neither is the right to an abortion. It is a modern right. But if you take it away, following Justice Alito’s and Prof. Amar’s reasoning, then all our modern rights have to go, or the Supreme Court loses any credibility it might have left."
