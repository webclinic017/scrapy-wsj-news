    "body": "With inflation running hot and the economy cooling, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin doesn’t need another reason to oppose a big tax hike-and-spending bill. But the Congressional Budget Office has given him one anyway, with its updated budget outlook that is even bleaker than its forecast last summer.<br />The good news is that tax revenues are booming. CBO projects that revenue this year will rise to 19.6% of GDP, the highest since 2000, and average 18.1% of the economy over the next decade. Higher tax revenue projections will shave $2.1 trillion off the deficit over 10 years. We don’t need to raise taxes to reduce the deficit."
