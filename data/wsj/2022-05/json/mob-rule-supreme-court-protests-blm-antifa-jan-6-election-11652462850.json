    "body": "Regarding Daniel Henninger’s “A Fence for the Supreme Court?” (Wonder Land, May 12): The spate of political violence in recent years has been exacerbated by the idea that my mob is good and your mob is evil.<br />While some conservative media and politicians have condemned the Jan. 6, 2021, mob assault on the Capital, many have fenced off President Donald Trump’s role in inciting those actions or, at a minimum, failed to condemn his woeful inaction as the assault developed. This cognitive dissonance sometimes helps to excuse the actions of the mob itself."
