    "body": "Investors in credit-card companies have beat the odds lately. Now they will have to decide whether to cash in their winnings or keep rolling the bet.<br />Shares of many companies in the business of card payments have held up in a turbulent year.  Discover Financial Services  and  Visa  are down a couple percentage points,  Mastercard  is virtually flat and  American Express  is up by a few points, defying double-digit declines across the finance and information-technology services sectors. Some big firms that handle card payments for merchants, such as  Fiserv ,  also are outperforming those indexes."
