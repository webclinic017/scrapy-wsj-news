    "body": "WASHINGTON—Former Treasury Department official Michael Barr is expected to pursue tougher oversight of the financial system and reverse some Trump-era policies if he wins confirmation as the Federal Reserve’s top bank regulator.<br />Mr. Barr, who worked in the Obama administration, is scheduled to face the Senate Banking Committee in a confirmation hearing Thursday, a hurdle to a four-year term as Fed vice chairman for supervision. If confirmed by the Senate, he would become the most influential U.S. financial regulator and have a voice on monetary policy."
