    "body": "Russian energy exports to Europe fuel Vladimir Putin’s war machine. Europeans are getting serious at long last about neutralizing this strategic weapon by proposing an embargo on Russian oil imports. Good for them.<br />The European Union’s latest round of sanctions seeks to ban imports of Russian crude over the next six months and refined products by the end of the year. Hungary and Slovakia, which rely more on Russian oil, will be granted until the end of 2023 to comply. The ban won’t have an immediate impact on the war, but it’s an important political and economic step."
