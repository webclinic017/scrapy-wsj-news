    "body": "Regarding the Museum of Jewish Heritage’s response (Letters, May 10) to our op-ed “Persona Non Grata at a Holocaust Memorial” (May 6): After many weeks of working out details of our event with museum staff, the museum sent us a carefully prepared contract. We signed without requesting a single change.<br />The museum then suddenly told us that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis would not be allowed to speak because he “didn’t align with the museum’s values” and would undermine its mission of teaching tolerance. If Mr. DeSantis was in, Tikvah was out. Jack Kliger, the museum’s president and CEO, now attempts to obfuscate those simple facts, presumably because he knows the museum’s position is indefensible."
