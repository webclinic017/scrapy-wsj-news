    "body": "Strong U.S. demand for computers, vehicles and oil helped drive the U.S. trade deficit to a record of $109.8 billion in March.<br />The Commerce Department on Wednesday said the trade deficit widened by 22.3% from the prior month. Imports rose by 10.3% to $351.5 billion as the U.S. took in far more goods than it exported. Exports, however, also rose strongly—increasing 5.6%—but didn’t keep pace with imports amid global uncertainty stemming from the conflict in Ukraine."
