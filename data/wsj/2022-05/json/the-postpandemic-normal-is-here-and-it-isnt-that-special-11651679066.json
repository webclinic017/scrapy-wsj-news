    "body": "There is more behind the stock market’s downdraft than higher inflation and interest rates. It is also a sign the economy has arrived at a new postpandemic normal—and it isn’t as lucrative as investors had hoped.<br />The pandemic catalyzed a once-in-a-generation change in consumer, worker and company behavior: a shift to remote life and work accompanied by the digitization of business models, from e-commerce to telehealth. Companies that drove this shift saw their sales, profits and especially stock prices skyrocket."
