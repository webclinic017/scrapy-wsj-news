    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Securities and Exchange Commission said Monday it has extended the public-comment period on three major rule proposals after receiving widespread complaints from interest groups that it wasn’t allowing enough time for analysis.<br />The SEC said it will accept comments until June 17 on proposed requirements for private funds, climate-related disclosures by companies and trading platforms for Treasury debt. The content of the proposals remains unchanged."
