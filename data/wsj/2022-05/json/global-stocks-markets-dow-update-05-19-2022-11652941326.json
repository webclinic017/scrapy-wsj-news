    "body": "Stock futures slid, pointing to deeper losses for U.S. markets on growing worries of an economic slowdown.<br />Futures for the S&P 500 fell 1.6%, suggesting the index will open close to bear market territoryâ€”market shorthand for a 20% fall from a recent high. The broad market gauge briefly fell into a bear market during the pandemic panic in March 2020 before launching on a two-year rally that peaked on Jan. 3 this year. It tumbled 4% Wednesday, its biggest one-day retreat since June 2020, as fears of a recession dragged down stocks across the board."
