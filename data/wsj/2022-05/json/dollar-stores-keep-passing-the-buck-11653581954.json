    "body": "Dollar stores are riding inflation like pros.<br />Both  Dollar General  and  Dollar Tree  reported better sales and profits on Thursday than Wall Street expected. Dollar General’s comparable-store sales remained more or less flat in its quarter ended April 29 compared with a year earlier, better than the 1.2% decline that analysts polled by Visible Alpha expected. Dollar Tree’s same-store sales growth of 4.4% blew past expectations, mostly thanks to its namesake chain, where consumers are responding well to its introduction of price points above $1."
