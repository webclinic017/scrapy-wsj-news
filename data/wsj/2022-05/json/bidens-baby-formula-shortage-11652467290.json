    "body": "Some lawmakers are asking whether the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has done enough to counter the nationwide shortage of baby formula. An even better question is why the Biden FDA caused it.<br />In the name of safety, the federal bureaucracy has turned a supply-chain challenge into a full-blown crisis. Few things are as disturbing as being a new parent and learning that your infant child is not thriving. For any number of reasons, some little ones need baby formula, and right now America doesn’t have enough of it. In this era it has sadly become common to see empty market shelves once occupied by various items. But this is not just any other product."
