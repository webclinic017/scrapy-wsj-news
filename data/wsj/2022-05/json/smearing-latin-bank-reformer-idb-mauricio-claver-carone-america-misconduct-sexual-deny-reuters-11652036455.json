    "body": "Defending the dignity of women in the workplace and fighting coddled elites are top priorities for the Biden administration. Or so it says. Now an unsubstantiated—and perhaps politically motivated—allegation against a female employee of the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington and her boss gives the U.S. president and his team a chance to walk the walk.<br />At issue is an anonymous March 29 email sent to the members of the bank’s “organization, human resources and board matters committee.” I have seen the email, which alleges, without evidence, that IDB President Mauricio Claver-Carone has “a romantic and inappropriate relationship with one of his subordinates” and implies that he has abused travel and expense accounts to disguise it."
