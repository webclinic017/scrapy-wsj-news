    "body": "Even among the crypto faithful, confidence in stablecoins has been shaken, and calls for regulation have intensified. Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) has proposed legislation, but the real question is why the government continues to sidestep existing laws and protections to coddle a stagnant, wasteful technology in search of a compelling legal-use case.<br />A stablecoin is the crypto-world’s preferred medium of exchange: a token pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. Maintaining the advertised fixed exchange rate, however, has been difficult for stablecoin issuers. The failure of TerraUSD this month was followed by Tether “breaking the buck.”"
