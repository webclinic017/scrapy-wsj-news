    "body": "Tom Hazelleaf (Letters, May 2) is right about letting markets lead the fight against climate change, but wrong about imposing a carbon tax. Gasoline is the largest emitter by far of new carbon dioxide. The price elasticity of gasoline is close to zero, so a carbon tax will raise a lot of money but won’t cut gasoline use much.<br />To do that, Congress should ban the sale of new vehicles that burn gasoline, leave existing vehicles alone and let the market decide between electric-, hydrogen- and biofuel-powered engines for new vehicles."
