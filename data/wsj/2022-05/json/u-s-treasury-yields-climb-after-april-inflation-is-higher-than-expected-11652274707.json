    "body": "U.S. Treasury yields climbed Wednesday after new data showed inflation in April was higher than analysts had expected.<br />Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, had declined overnight but jumped immediately after the Labor Department said that the consumer price index, excluding volatile food and energy categories, climbed 0.6% in April from the previous month. That was above the 0.4% gain in so-called core prices anticipated by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal."
