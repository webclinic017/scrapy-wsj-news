    "body": "Lack of competition in the rail market is adding to the cost of energy products like gasoline and millions of everyday products that come from petrochemicals. “This Month’s Inflation Scapegoat? Railroads” (Review & Outlook, May 5) claims that railroads are being unfairly blamed for rising costs, but public hearings in late April tell a different story. Over two days, rail shippers representing industries from energy and consumer goods to agriculture relayed examples of rail-service declines affecting the cost of consumer goods.<br />An industry once composed of over 30 major railroads now has only seven serving U.S. shippers. Nearly 80% of U.S. refiners and petrochemical manufacturers have only one freight rail option, and with little negotiating power they face poor service and exorbitant shipping rates. Since transportation accounts for around 15% of the cost of gasoline and diesel, this lack of competition has a direct impact on consumer pocketbooks."
