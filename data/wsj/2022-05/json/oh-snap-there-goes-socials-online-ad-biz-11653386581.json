    "body": "Investors knew that the world wasn’t clicking for online advertisers right now. In a snap on Monday night, they grasped how dire the situation might be.<br />Nearly every major player in the sector reported a notable slowdown in advertising revenue growth during the recent first-quarter earnings season. All but one actually missed Wall Street’s targets for that category as well. Then, in a surprise announcement,  Snap Inc.,  the parent company of Snapchat, said in a filing Monday afternoon that revenue and adjusted pretax earnings for the second quarter will come in below the range the company projected barely a month ago."
