    "body": "With supply-chain bottlenecks hitting apparel makers and inflation squeezing shoppers, now might seem like the time for used-clothing sellers to shine. The market doesnâ€™t quite see it that way.<br />Luxury consignor  RealReal  on Tuesday reported that sales through its platform, known as gross merchandise value, grew 31% in the first quarter compared with a year earlier, better than Wall Street expectations. Gross profit grew a healthy 35%.  ThredUp ,  which sells more-generic brands, said on its earnings call Monday that it saw 31% growth in revenue over the same period, a number that was in line with analyst expectations. Its gross profit growth of 26% was better than expected, helped by improved logistics as the company got better at consolidating orders before they were shipped."
