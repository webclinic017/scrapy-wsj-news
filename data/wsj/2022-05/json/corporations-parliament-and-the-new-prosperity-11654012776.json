    "body": "Phil Gramm and Mike Solon make a number of telling points in a long-running debate about corporate purpose in “The ‘Stakeholder’ War on the Enlightenment” (op-ed, May 24), but the history they offer to provide context is problematic. They write that the enlightened 18th-century British Parliament “repealed royal charters” and “permitted businesses to incorporate simply by meeting preset capital requirements.”<br />In fact, Parliament enacted in 1720 the Bubble Act, which imposed penalties on corporate undertakings lacking due authorization by a royal charter or legislation. The Bubble Act wasn’t repealed until 1825, and Parliament didn’t authorize incorporation of limited-liability companies without support from a royal charter or legislation until the mid-1850s. No minimum capital requirements were imposed at that time."
