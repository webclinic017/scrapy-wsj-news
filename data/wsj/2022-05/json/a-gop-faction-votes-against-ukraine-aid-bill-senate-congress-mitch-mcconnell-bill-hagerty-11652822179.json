    "body": "Congress is close to approving $40 billion in aid for Ukraine, but it’s notable that 68 House and Senate Republicans voted no. Their arguments aren’t persuasive and suggest a growing isolationism in the GOP.<br />The Senate advanced the bill 81-11 on Monday after the House voted 368-57 last week. All the nays came from the GOP. Some were predictable: Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky took the bill hostage last week, saying the U.S. “cannot continue to spend money we don’t have.”"
