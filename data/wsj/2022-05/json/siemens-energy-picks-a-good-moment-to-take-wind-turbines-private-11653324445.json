    "body": "Long-suffering shareholders in  Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy  will likely be spared the decision of whether to quit or wait patiently for the renewable-energy revolution.<br />Shares in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy rose 6.2% Monday after its majority shareholder,  Siemens Energy ,  on Saturday confirmed longstanding expectations that it wanted to take the wind-turbine business private. It said it would pay â‚¬18.05 a share, equivalent to $19.25, for the outstanding 32.9% of its subsidiary. Cost and revenue synergies are expected eventually, but the primary reason it gave for the buyout was to accelerate the continuing turnaround."
