    "body": "Regarding Richard Shinder’s op-ed “Student Loan Relief Should Come in Bankruptcy Court” (May 11): I propose the following adjustments: The federal government stops making student loans. Congress amends the bankruptcy laws to allow the discharge of student loans. Thereafter, each college will finance all student loans out of its endowment.<br />This will serve at least two purposes. First, colleges will no longer be able to raise tuition by the amount of the government subsidy with impunity. Second, the ability of a student to discharge a loan should increase the due diligence on the part of a college when determining how much and at what rate to lend to a prospective student. Only when colleges suffer the consequences of their indiscriminate spending, and face the possibility of student default, will some sense of sanity return to the college cost structure."
