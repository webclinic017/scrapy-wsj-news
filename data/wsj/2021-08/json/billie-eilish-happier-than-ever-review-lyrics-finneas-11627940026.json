    "body": "<br /><br /><br /><br />Billie Eilish’s 2019 debut album “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” was notable because of the singer’s age—she was 17 on its release date—and because of its massive streaming numbers and five Grammy wins. But it was also a mainstream smash of rare substance. Unlike so many teen-pop offerings from years past, it was formally daring. The combination of Ms. Eilish’s whispered vocals, delivered in clipped phrases that evinced her love of hip-hop, and the production by her musical partner and brother, Finneas—minimal yet forceful, often heavy on distorted bass—sounded like nothing else in the mainstream. Singing about adolescent woes with sly humor streaked with the macabre, Ms. Eilish appealed to preteens but also drew praise from rock elders such as Radiohead’s Thom Yorke and Foo Fighters’ Dave Grohl."
