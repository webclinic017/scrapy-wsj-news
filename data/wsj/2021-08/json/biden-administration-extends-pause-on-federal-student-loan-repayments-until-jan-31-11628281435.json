    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is extending a moratorium on federal student-loan payments through early 2022.<br />The Education Department made the announcement Friday, and it follows an earlier extension President Biden made when he took office. The moratorium was set to expire at the end of September and has been extended until Jan. 31.<br />The Education Department said that this would be the final extension.<br />“The department believes this additional time and a definitive end date will allow borrowers to plan for the resumption of payments and reduce the risk of delinquency and defaults after restart,” Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in a statement. “The department will continue its work to transition borrowers smoothly back into repayment, including by improving student loan servicing.“<br />Loan repayments and interest accrual has been paused for borrowers with federal student loans since March 13, 2020. Collection on defaulted loans has been suspended as well."
