    "body": "New York Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul is lining up support among local politicians as she transitions to become New York’s first female governor after Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday he would resign.<br />Ms. Hochul, a Democrat, plans to address the public Wednesday afternoon, her office said.<br />She accelerated preparations to assume the governorship in recent days after a report by state Attorney General Letitia James found that the Democratic governor broke state and federal sexual-harassment laws. She will take over as governor in approximately two weeks.<br />Mr. Cuomo said the report was flawed during a Tuesday press conference and has denied inappropriately touching anybody. The accusations spawned an impeachment probe that Mr. Cuomo said would be a distraction, and he would step aside to let the state move forward.<br />Ms. Hochul spent Tuesday afternoon calling officials around the state who have advised her during her time in office, according to some people who received her call. She had previously spoken with advisers about whom to hire and which members of Mr. Cuomo’s administration might remain in their posts."
