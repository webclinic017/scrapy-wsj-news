    "body": "The Federal Aviation Administration said it wants airports to help tamp down bad behavior by travelers.<br />The number of incidents involving unruly passengers has surged this year, according to regulators. Flight attendants said they have been harassed, threatened, and in some cases physically attacked.<br />The FAA has pledged to take a more aggressive approach to pursuing punishments, including hefty fines, for passengers who flout safety rules. But the agency said it has been inundated with reports of out-of-control passengers, and needs help from airports and law enforcement.<br />“While the FAA has levied civil fines against unruly passengers, it has no authority to prosecute criminal cases,” FAA Administrator Steve Dickson wrote to airport officials around the U.S. in a letter released Thursday. Law-enforcement officers are frequently asked to meet planes at their gates following incidents, but often release passengers without charges, Mr. Dickson wrote.<br />“When this occurs, we miss a key opportunity to hold unruly passengers accountable for their unacceptable and dangerous behavior,” he said."
