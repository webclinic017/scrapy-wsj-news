    "body": "Investors could see  Apple Inc.  and  Bank of America Corp.  stocks selling for $152.005 or $42.115 a share if regulators sign off on a proposal submitted this week.<br />Members Exchange, a startup exchange backed by major Wall Street firms, said in a proposal that the Securities and Exchange Commission should allow some heavily traded stocks to be priced in increments of half a cent.<br />The exchange, known as MEMX for short, said its proposal would lower costs for investors by reducing bid-ask spreadsâ€”the difference between the buying and selling prices of a stock.<br />There is no guarantee that the SEC will approve the request MEMX filed with the agency on Monday. But the proposal comes as the SEC is conducting a review of market structure prompted by the frenzied trading in  GameStop Corp.  and other meme stocks earlier this year. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has said that minimum price increments are part of the review.<br />MEMX says its proposal has broad support within the financial industry. The exchange is owned by a consortium of Wall Street firms, including electronic trading giants Citadel Securities and  Virtu Financial Inc.,  banks such as  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  and  Morgan Stanley ,  brokerage Charles Schwab Corp. and asset-management giant  BlackRock Inc."
