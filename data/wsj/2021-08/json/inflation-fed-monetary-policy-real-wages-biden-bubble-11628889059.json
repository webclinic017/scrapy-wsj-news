    "body": "Your excellent editorial “Biden Has an Inflation Problem” (Aug. 12) points out that average real wages have fallen for seven months in a row. In other words, the Biden inflation has reduced the real wages of workers in every month that he has been in office. This confirms yet again that high inflation is a way of cutting wages by sneaky central-bank means.<br />This inflation has come as a surprise to the Federal Reserve, as it busily monetizes government debt, but it is no surprise at all. It reflects the most fundamental principle in economics: Nothing is free. You pay for monetizing government debt by taking money from the wage earners and robbing the savers.<br />Alex J.
