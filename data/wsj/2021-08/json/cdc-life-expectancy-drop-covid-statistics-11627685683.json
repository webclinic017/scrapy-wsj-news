    "body": "David Colander describes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s finding that life expectancy fell by 1.5 years in 2020 as fake news and a failure to understand statistics (“Covid Will Increase Life Expectancy,” op-ed, July 29). The CDC said that about 74% of the decline is due to excess Covid-19 mortality.<br />The CDC reported life expectancy as it typically does, based on a period life table. One can’t help but wonder what Mr. Colander would want the CDC to have done. Perhaps he does not want it to produce any report at all about life expectancy for 2020? Or he prefers a life-expectancy calculation with Covid-19 mortality removed because it will decline in the future? If so, the CDC would have to speculate on the rate of reduced Covid-19 deaths as well as long-term Covid-19-related death rates due to undetected medical conditions, postponed medical procedures and other conditions not currently understood.<br />No one expects the current age-specific mortality rates to be unchanged throughout a newborn baby’s life. That applies to Covid-19 mortality as well as other causes of death, such as drug use, homicides and traffic accidents. The CDC’s calculation of life expectancy is “just the facts ma’am,” without guesses about the future.<br />Prof. James Ciecka<br />DePaul University"
