    "body": "At Russia’s premier expo for military aircraft in July, Russian President Vladimir Putin inspected a prototype jet that is designed to take on more than enemy fighters. The lightweight stealth plane also is meant to cause geopolitical headaches for the U.S.<br />The LTS Checkmate would be the world’s second single-engine fighter plane to incorporate the most sophisticated radar-evasion and command systems. The only other plane in this category, the F-35, manufactured by  Lockheed Martin Corp. , is the most advanced plane in the U.S. arsenal.<br />The F-35 is in demand internationally, providing Washington a viable defense export that also helps advance U.S. security and diplomatic aims. Israel and Japan are among the 15 countries that have received the F-35 or reached agreements to buy it.<br />Russian officials have said they would like to sell the Checkmate to the United Arab Emirates, Argentina, India, and Vietnam—countries with U.S. security ties—though none has yet agreed to a deal.<br />Checkmate, as its name suggests, aims to contest U.S. strategic leverage, defense analysts say. Russian officials characterized the plane as a commercial project."
