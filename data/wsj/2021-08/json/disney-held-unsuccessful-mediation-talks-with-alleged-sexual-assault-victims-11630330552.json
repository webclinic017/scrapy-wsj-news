    "body": "Walt Disney Co.  and its ABC unit held unsuccessful mediation talks in June with the two women who have alleged they were sexually assaulted by a former ABC News executive, people with knowledge of the matter said.<br />The claims against the executive, former “Good Morning America” producer Michael Corn, surfaced last week in a lawsuit filed by one of the women, ABC News producer Kirstyn Crawford. Mr. Corn has denied wrongdoing and called the allegations fabrications.<br />The suit also named ABC as a defendant, alleging that the network had received complaints about Mr. Corn’s conduct from several women over roughly a decade but failed to take disciplinary action.<br />The mediation talks came after Disney concluded an investigation into the women’s allegations against Mr. Corn, people close to the company and the alleged victims said.<br />Mr. Corn was pushed out by ABC News in April, the people said. When Mr. Corn left the company after a nearly two-decade tenure, neither he nor ABC gave a reason for his departure."
