The cause of death was believed to be a heart attack.<br />“Rich Trumka devoted his life to working people,” AFL-CIO Communications Director Tim Schlittner said in a statement. “He was a relentless champion of workers’ rights, workplace safety, worker-centered trade, democracy and so much more.”<br />Mr. Trumka grew up in Nemacolin, Pa., where his father and grandfather were coal miners, according to his biography on the labor federation’s website. Mr. Trumka also worked in the mines, while attending Pennsylvania State University. Mr. Trumka, who enjoyed discussing Nittany Lion football, also earned a law degree at Villanova University.<br />In 1982, at age 33, Mr. Trumka was elected the youngest president of the United Mine Workers of America, according to the AFL-CIO. In that role, he led a strike against Pittston Coal Co."
