    "body": "WASHINGTON—A federal appeals court allowed the Biden administration’s latest eviction moratorium to remain in place, a move that could return the issue to the Supreme Court in a matter of days.<br />A three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Friday declined an emergency request by a group of property managers and realtors to lift the new moratorium, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put in place on Aug. 3.<br />The appeal court’s order was brief and didn’t offer detailed legal reasoning.<br />“We are disappointed in today’s ruling, but the plaintiffs will continue fighting on behalf of America’s mom-and-pop housing providers and plan to file an emergency motion to the Supreme Court immediately,” said a spokesman for the National Association of Realtors, which helped fund the legal challenge.<br />The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."
