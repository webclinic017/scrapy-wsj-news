    "body": "Target Corp.  reported increased revenue in the second quarter as more people returned to stores and online spending moderated compared with last summer, when the Covid-19 pandemic upended shopping habits.<br />The retailer said comparable sales, which include in-store and online purchases, for the quarter rose 8.9% from a year earlier, when they jumped 24.3% because people stocked up on groceries and because many other retail chains were temporarily closed.<br />Most of the growth in the latest quarter was driven by purchases of apparel, food and other items at the chain’s stores. Foot traffic rose 12.7% for the quarter. Digital sales increased 10%, after nearly tripling in the second quarter of 2020.<br />“We believe that America still embraces stores, and the traffic we’re seeing tells us that stores continue to play a very important role,” Chief Executive Brian Cornell said on a conference call.<br />The report comes a day after larger rival  Walmart Inc.  reported strong in-store sales and foot traffic. Results from both chains—which sell groceries, added curbside services and stayed open throughout the pandemic—showed little impact from the recent rise in Covid-19 cases in the U.S."
