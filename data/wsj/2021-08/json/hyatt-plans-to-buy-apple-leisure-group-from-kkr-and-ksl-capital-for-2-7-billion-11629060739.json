    "body": "Hyatt Hotels Corp.  plans to buy resort company Apple Leisure Group from its private-equity owners for $2.7 billion including any debt, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />A deal for the company, which is owned by  KKR  & Co. and travel-and-leisure specialist KSL Capital Partners LLC, could be announced Monday.<br />The transaction is the latest sign of optimism about a return to vacation travel even as the U.S. economy continues to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic. Like many travel-related companies, Apple Leisure’s business got clobbered by virus-related lockdowns and travel bans last year, but it has rebounded as restrictions have loosened.<br />For Chicago-based Hyatt, one of the world’s biggest hospitality companies, the deal would bolster its already considerable resort-management portfolio and give it one of the biggest U.S. providers of charter flights and vacation packages for travel to Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the Caribbean.<br />It also would accelerate Hyatt’s transformation, long under way, to a more asset-light business model, focusing on generating an ongoing stream of steady and predictable fees."
