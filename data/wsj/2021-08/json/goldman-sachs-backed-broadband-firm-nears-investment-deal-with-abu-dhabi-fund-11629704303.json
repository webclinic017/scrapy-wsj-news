    "body": "An investment group that includes Abu Dhabi’s sovereign-wealth fund is close to acquiring a minority stake in CityFibre Infrastructure Holdings in a deal that would value the U.K. fiber-optic-broadband provider at more than $2.7 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The investment would be from Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co. and the investment arm linked to the family behind IKEA, the people said.<br />It comes as wholesale broadband network providers like CityFibre and incumbent telecom operators such as  AT&T Inc.  in the U.S. and Britain’s  BT Group  PLC are racing to expand their high-speed networks to reach more customers and support the rollout of superfast 5G wireless services.<br />At the same time, the promise of recurring revenue generated from the high-speed transmission of video and other bandwidth-hogging data is drawing investors seeking steady long-term returns.<br />The deal, if finalized, is expected to be announced over the coming weeks and would value CityFibre at more than £2 billion, equivalent to $2.7 billion, the people said."
