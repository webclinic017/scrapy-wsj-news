    "body": "ISTANBUL—Turkey said it would allow people who got Chinese-made Covid-19 shots to be fully revaccinated with  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech  SE doses, to help ease travel to countries that haven’t approved the Chinese vaccines.<br />The Turkish government has inoculated millions using the vaccine made by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. since rolling out its campaign in January. It began using the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine months later, and in July started offering a booster shot to some people amid concerns over the Chinese vaccine’s effectiveness against the highly infectious Delta variant.<br />Ankara said it approved the additional Pfizer-BioNTech shots due to travel restrictions in some countries that require people to receive Pfizer and other Western-approved vaccines, according to Turkey’s official news agency.<br />Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said the decision was driven by travel restrictions, and not health concerns.<br />“Only specific types of vaccines are accepted for entry to certain countries. A special regulation has been made for those who request to have 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine in order to comply with the regulations of those countries,” he said in a tweet."
