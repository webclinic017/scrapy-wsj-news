    "body": "With the global chip shortage continuing to muck up automotive supply chains and vehicle prices at record levels, consumers looking for a new set of wheels have a lot to consider.<br />“I always say don’t get stuck with a ‘new-car only’ or ‘used-car only’ buyer mentality,” says Ivan Drury, an automotive analyst at the car-shopping website Edmunds.com. “Depending on the market and your situation, the best deal could be the opposite of an outdated paradigm.”<br />Some consumers are finding that their used vehicles are worth thousands of dollars more than what they had paid.
