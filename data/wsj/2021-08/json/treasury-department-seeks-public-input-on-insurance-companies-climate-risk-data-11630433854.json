    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Treasury Department is seeking public input on the effects of natural disasters and other climate-related risks to the insurance industry, the latest step the Biden administration has taken to tackle concerns posed by climate change.<br />A Treasury office charged with monitoring the insurance industry is seeking public input for 75 days on how climate change could affect private insurers, including which data are needed to develop standardized climate-related financial risk disclosures for the sector.<br />“Over the past 30 years, the incidence of natural disasters has dramatically increased and the actual and future potential cost to the economy has skyrocketed,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. “We are now in a situation where climate change is an existential risk to our future economy and way of life”<br />Tuesday’s move is part of the Biden administration effort to address climate change and its impact on various industries. The Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to require more disclosures from public companies on the potential impact of climate change on their businesses.<br />Treasury’s request for information is likely to inform the data the department’s Federal Insurance Office collects from the industry and the information it shares with states, which are the primary regulators of insurance companies. “Maintaining the financial stability of the insurance sector will involve identifying and filling gaps (if any) in insurance supervision with a focus on assessing climate-related financial risks,” Treasury said."
