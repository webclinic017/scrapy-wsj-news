    "body": "Regarding Warren Kozak’s “Social Breakdown Starts With Skipping a Stop Sign” (op-ed, July 26): New York City is a mess. Each time I venture out, I have doubts that I will return home unscathed. Will it be death by Grubhub delivery, or maybe a bicycle going the wrong way, on the sidewalk or through a red light? Perhaps I’ll be taken out, like Broadway actress Lisa Banes, by a scooter. She was hit by a scooter running a red light on June 4 and died of her injuries 10 days later. Was anyone ever arrested for that? Anything that has wheels should have a license. Cyclists going the wrong way or riding on sidewalks should be fined and have their bicycles impounded.<br />Rose Anderson<br />New York<br /><br />It was encouraging to read Mr. Kozak’s op-ed protesting the nationwide epidemic of traffic deaths. Our own families are contained in the body count. Amy’s son, Sammy Cohen Eckstein, was 12 when he was struck by a reckless driver and killed in a crosswalk. Rebecca’s brother, Paul Sonkin, was 16 when his friend flipped his car off a freeway ramp. No one should have to endure our heartbreak."
