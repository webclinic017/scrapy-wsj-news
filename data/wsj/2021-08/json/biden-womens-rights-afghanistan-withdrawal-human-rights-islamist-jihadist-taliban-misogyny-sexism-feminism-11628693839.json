    "body": "‘Why did America send you to Afghanistan?” the young woman asked me when I was speaking to the teachers at the country’s first rural girls’ high school in 2010.<br />“Nobody sent me,” I replied through a translator. “I came here from New York as an unpaid volunteer and as a director of the Initiative to Educate Afghan Women.”<br />“Then why are you doing this?” asked another young teacher. “It’s so dangerous here, near Kandahar.”<br />“I’m doing it for my grandmother,” I said. “When she was your age, American women could not vote. But she was already a lawyer, in 1908. So she became president of the suffrage movement in her state, Illinois, which was our first state to vote for the suffrage amendment to our Constitution. Here you can vote now. You already have 60 women in the Afghan Parliament.”<br />Then a U.S. Air Force colonel, who had built the high school with his discretionary funds, spoke. He was commander of the forward operating base where I was staying. He had contacted me where I was housed in Kabul, at the heavily guarded home of the president of the Red Crescent Society. There I was interviewing young women who wanted to attend college in America before returning home to become leaders in Afghanistan."
