    "body": "After her second vaccine shot, my wife had no doubt about her top priority before mingling—coloring her hair.<br />“Finally, a trip to the beauty parlor,” I said. “What are you, 95?” Sarah replied.<br />Not quite. But she was right about my attachment to antiquated terms. A child of the early ’60s, I’ll always think of the salon as a beauty parlor, where I shoved my head in the space-age dryer while waiting for my mom and sitting next to heavily perfumed women named Pearl and Shirley.<br />And there’s more where that came from: Sometimes I channel my inner Tennessee Williams. “You might need a wrap,” I tell Sarah as we head out on a chilly night, to which she answers: “Are we going to the opera?” She’ll hand me a well-made egg-white omelet on a roll and I’ll say: “What a handsome sandwich.” An acquaintance in her 60s tells me about a guy she’s dating, and I’ll ask about her gentleman friend.<br />I’m particularly backward about women’s intimate apparel, maybe because my great-aunt Lillian owned a lingerie store, though back then it was called a corset shop. I grew up hearing about brassieres and business hosiery and was in my 30s before I realized most women no longer wore girdles. So yes, I think of Victoria’s Secret as a fancy store for unmentionables."
