    "body": "Regarding Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.’s “Let a Biden Rethink Include Antitrust” (Business World, Aug. 28): Under U.S. antitrust laws, it can be illegal for a company to: (1) set prices below competition; (2) set prices above competition; and (3) set prices to match competition. How can a company avoid guilt?<br />Decades ago, the Federal Trade Commission doubled down on the absurdity by suing Westinghouse and GE for offering large turbine generators at matching prices, even though the government conceded that the two firms did not collude to fix prices. The government essentially demanded that the companies stop being aware of their competitor’s prices.<br />In a free market, companies earn great market power only by benefiting their customers. Nevertheless, they must always be looking over their shoulders lest a competitor or shifting technology undercut them. Note that Westinghouse no longer exists and GE is a shadow of its former majesty. In reality, only governments can create sustainable monopolies.<br />Most likely U.S. presidents love their arbitrary antitrust weapon because they can use it to intimidate or punish successful firms that displease them. Rather than fight this piecemeal, it might be more realistic for companies to combine their lobbying power to persuade Congress to repeal U.S. antitrust law. Perhaps they can also promise to pay to retrain unemployed antitrust lawyers.<br />Rich Batey"
