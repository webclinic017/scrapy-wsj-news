    "body": "Southwest Airlines Co.  said the recent surge in Covid-19 cases is causing bookings to slow and cancellations to rise, showing how quickly the Delta variant is denting economic activity.<br />The airline said Wednesday that while demand for the key Labor Day weekend remained healthy, the recent slowdown would make it difficult to turn a profit in the third quarter, excluding the impact of government payroll assistance. That is even after a fare sale designed to stoke the return of business traffic in the fall.<br />Southwest’s move reverses airline executives’ bullish tone just a few weeks ago, with rising Delta-variant infections prompting the cancellation of festivals and trade events such as the New York Auto Show planned for later this month.<br />Some consumers are reconsidering activities like travel and eating at restaurants as the surge leads certain retailers and municipalities to reimpose mask mandates.<br />The weekly average number of seated diners tracked on restaurant reservation platform OpenTable was down 8% from 2019 levels for the week that ended Aug. 10, a reversal since late June, when dining activity surpassed 2019 levels. Credit-card spending tracked by Chase shows that air-travel purchases have slipped in recent weeks while restaurants spending has leveled off, J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note Tuesday."
