    "body": "General Motors Co.  posted strong second-quarter earnings and raised its full-year profit guidance but said the lingering computer-chip shortage and rising commodity costs would weigh on second-half results.<br />GM on Wednesday said solid pickup-truck sales and record profits for its in-house lending arm—boosted by soaring used-car prices—helped it notch $2.8 billion in net profit, compared with a loss a year earlier.<br />The auto maker posted pretax earnings before one-time items of $4.1 billion, or $1.97 per share, better than the average analyst estimate of $1.82, according to FactSet.<br />GM raised its pretax profit outlook to between $11.5 billion and $13.5 billion, up from a previous forecast of between $10 billion to $11 billion.<br />GM shares slipped about 4% in premarket trading. Evercore ISI analyst Chris McNally said investors may be disappointed in the profit forecast, which implies pretax earnings of $3 billion to $5 billion for the second half of the year. Wall Street likely was looking for at least $6 billion, he said."
