    "body": "AUSTIN, Texas—The Texas state House approved a voting bill 79-37 late Thursday night, after walk-outs by Democrats paralyzed the law’s progress for months.<br />The bill, championed by Republicans as a way to enhance election security, would broadly tighten voting procedures across the state. Democrats said it would restrict access to the polls, especially for minorities.<br />The House spent Thursday debating the bill for more than 12 hours, considering dozens of amendments. It will require one more vote before heading back to the state Senate, which has already approved it, to consider the House changes before it goes to Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, for a signature.<br />The battle over the bill is part of a national debate over election security and voter suppression in the wake of President Biden’s election, which some supporters of former President Donald Trump claimed was illegitimate. States including Florida and Georgia passed bills placing more restrictions on certain types of voting, drawing pushback from civil rights groups and corporations. No court has found evidence of widespread voter fraud.<br />In Texas, state House Democrats first halted the bill in May by walking out ahead of a voting deadline in the final days of the legislature’s regular biennial session, denying the body a two-thirds quorum required to conduct votes. When Mr. Abbott called a special legislative session to pass the bill in July, more than 55 House Democrats went to Washington, D.C., to break quorum again."
