    "body": "WASHINGTON—Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) raised alarms about inflation in a letter to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Thursday, calling on the central bank to start reversing the emergency support it has provided during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />“With the recession over and our strong economic recovery well underway, I am increasingly alarmed that the Fed continues to inject record amounts of stimulus into our economy,” he wrote.<br />Mr. Manchin wrote in the letter that he was concerned the Fed’s easy money policies and additional spending legislation in Congress could exacerbate recent spikes in inflation. The Senate is currently working on both a roughly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill and a $3.5 trillion bill of Democratic priorities, for which Mr. Manchin’s support will be pivotal.<br />“I am deeply concerned that the continuing stimulus put forth by the Fed, and proposal for additional fiscal stimulus, will lead to our economy overheating and to unavoidable inflation taxes that hard working Americans cannot afford,” he wrote.<br />The Fed cut its short-term benchmark interest rate to near zero in March 2020 and has been purchasing $120 billion per month in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to drive down longer-term rates to provide added stimulus."
