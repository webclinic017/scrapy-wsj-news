    "body": "Former Theranos Inc. founder and Silicon Valley star Elizabeth Holmes goes on trial Aug. 31 on charges that she defrauded investors and patients about her blood-testing startup. Here’s what we know so far.<br />Elizabeth Holmes dropped out of Stanford University at 19 years old to start the company that became Theranos, a startup that promised to revolutionize the blood-testing industry. After operating largely in secret for a decade, Theranos began in 2013 touting its technology, which it said could test for dozens of health conditions with a few drops of blood extracted from a finger prick, eliminating the need for large needles and vials of blood.<br />The company said it wanted to make blood testing more user-friendly and offered tests at rates that were lower than competitors.<br />Theranos announced a partnership with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. in September 2013 that put Theranos centers in Arizona and California pharmacies, and had signed a major deal with the Safeway Inc. grocery store chain. The company’s valuation eventually reached more than $9 billion.<br />The Wall Street Journal began reporting on questions about Theranos in 2015, revealing that only a few tests could be performed on its proprietary technology and that most were being run on traditional machines, including some that Theranos altered to work with diluted finger-prick samples."
