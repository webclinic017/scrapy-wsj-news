    "body": "U.S. stock futures hovered close to record highs, but a tumble in oil prices and a brief slump in gold and silver prices signaled investor unease about the strength of the economic recovery.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 edged down 0.2% early Monday, after the broad-market index notched a record on Friday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also ticked down 0.2%. Nasdaq-100 futures were relatively flat, wavering between small gains and losses.<br />Global oil benchmark Brent crude dropped 3.9% to $67.95, putting it on track for its lowest settlement price since May. An outbreak of Covid-19 in China renewed concerns about another hit to demand from the virus, traders said. Prices were also weighed down by customs data over the weekend that showed China imported less crude a day in July than in June, analysts said.<br />Gold and silver briefly tumbled early Monday before recovering much of the lost ground. Analysts attributed the fall to rising bond yields and an appreciation in the dollar in the wake of Friday’s strong U.S. jobs report.<br />Gold futures were down 1% at $1,745.45 a troy ounce. Earlier, they dropped as low as $1,672.80 a troy ounce, marking a 5.1% decline from Friday’s close. Silver futures fell as much as 7%, but were recently down just 1.8%."
