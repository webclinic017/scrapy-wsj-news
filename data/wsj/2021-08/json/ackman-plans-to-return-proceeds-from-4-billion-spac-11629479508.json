    "body": "Hedge-fund billionaire William Ackman, who launched the largest-ever special-purpose acquisition company with an aim of landing a big target to take public, may now return its funds to shareholders in the face of a lawsuit questioning the vehicle’s legality.<br />Mr. Ackman disclosed plans to unwind the $4 billion vehicle,  Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd. , in a letter to its shareholders that was posted to his firm’s website.<br />“While we believe the lawsuit is meritless, the nature of the suit and our legal system make it unlikely that it can be resolved in the short term,” Mr. Ackman wrote, adding that it could also deter potential deal partners from working with the SPAC.<br />The move represents a further retreat after Pershing Square Tontine backed away from a deal to invest in Universal Music Group. The vehicle was launched last summer, and in June announced plans to buy a 10% stake in Universal Music from French media conglomerate  Vivendi SE .  The complicated move surprised some investors who expected more of a traditional SPAC deal, in which an empty shell raises funds in an IPO and then looks for a business to merge with and take public.<br />But Mr. Ackman dropped the plan the following month after failing to convince the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the deal met the rules for such vehicles and some shareholders balked. Instead he said his investment firm, Pershing Square Holdings Ltd., would take a stake in Universal."
