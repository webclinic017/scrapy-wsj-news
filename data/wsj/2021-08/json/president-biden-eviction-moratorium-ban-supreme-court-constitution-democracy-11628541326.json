    "body": "Elie Mystelwriting for the Nation, Aug. 9:<br /><br />Already, the new eviction moratorium is being challenged in district court. . . . The Biden administration’s defense is unlikely to hold up. In court papers defending the moratorium, the Department of Justice argued that the new eviction ban is within the government’s statutory powers because it covers only the 80 percent of the country experiencing community spread of the virus, not all of it. That, sadly, is a legally pathetic argument. . . .<br />This, I suppose, is exactly the point at which I’m supposed to join the chorus of pundits and chastise Biden for his Trumpian use of executive power and for embracing what is likely an illegal action. The court made itself clear, but the president is going ahead anyway—where have we heard that story before? It would be a perfect, virtue-signaling layup for me to say, “I criticized Trump and now I criticize Biden” because “process matters” and “the ends can’t justify the means.” . . .<br />But I just can’t join in the legal tut-tutting. I come from a tradition in which you sometimes have to violate bad laws—by any means necessary."
