    "body": "NEW ORLEANS—The winds and rain from Hurricane Ida have passed, but the devastation wreaked by the storm weighs on every aspect of life here.<br />Schools are closed indefinitely. Officials say power will be out for up to three weeks. Cell service is spotty, and hospitals already burdened by Covid-19 are relying on generators and water reserves since water and sewer outages are widespread.<br />Roads are blocked, stores are closed and the heat is punishing, with the National Weather Service issuing a heat advisory Tuesday for southern Louisiana and southern Mississippi, predicting a heat index of 105 degrees.<br />“If you have evacuated, it’s pretty clear that now is not the time to return,” Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said in a news conference late Monday. “Quite frankly, we need to put as little demand on our water systems and our electric grid as possible.”<br />Ida has killed at least four people. Two people died late Monday in coastal Mississippi after driving into a massive sinkhole after a highway collapsed, according to the state’s Highway Patrol. Another 10 people were injured, 3 critically."
