    "body": "In “It’s Time to Start Requiring Covid Vaccines” (Politics & Ideas, July 28), William Galston offers an excellent summary and analysis of Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905). His comment that the state has options to “compel” vaccination, however, is not entirely accurate. The Supreme Court did not rule that by state police power Jacobson could be compelled to be vaccinated, but only that on his refusal he could be fined the $5 amount in the state statute and be committed if he didn’t pay. Five dollars then is equivalent to about $150 today. I would bet that many people looking at a $100 or $150 fine would change their mind about vaccination.<br />Frank R. Filiatreau Jr.<br />Murrells Inlet, S.C.<br /><br />What is needed to encourage vaccination is a public-service announcement featuring both our president and his predecessor. They could bump elbows, and President Biden could thank President Trump for his role in the medical miracle of Operation Warp Speed, and also apologize for the way he and Vice President Kamala Harris showed skepticism toward the vaccine before the election."
