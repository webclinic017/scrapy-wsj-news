    "body": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized booster shots for certain people with weakened immune systems, likely the launch of broader efforts to better protect against evasive variants like Delta.<br />The agency on Thursday cleared giving a third dose of a messenger RNA Covid-19 vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and its partner  BioNTech SE  or from  Moderna Inc.  to immunocompromised people who had received a solid organ transplant or individuals who have been diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise.<br />“After a thorough review of the available data, the FDA determined that this small, vulnerable group may benefit from a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna Vaccines,” Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a statement.<br />She said other people who are fully vaccinated are adequately protected and don’t need an additional dose at this time. The agency is reviewing whether an additional dose may be needed in the future, she said.<br />The decision expanding the authorization of the mRNA shots follows evidence that vaccines are less effective at protecting people with weakened immune systems from Covid-19 than the general population."
