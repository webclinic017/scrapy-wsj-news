    "body": "At least three people were killed by gunfire Monday morning in chaotic scenes at the passenger terminal of Kabul’s international airport, where thousands of Afghans who fear for their lives after the Taliban takeover of the country converged in hopes of getting on an evacuation flight as the insurgents consolidate their control over the capital.<br />Witnesses reported seeing the prone, bloodied bodies lying on the ground just outside the terminal building.<br />The U.S. military took over security of the airport to facilitate a massive airlift of foreign diplomats and citizens after the Afghan government collapsed on Sunday. Those evacuation flights are processed on a separate military side of the airport.<br />Officials at the U.S. Central Command weren’t immediately available for comment.<br />Thousands of desperate Afghans—many of whom used to work for American forces—flocked to the airport as the victorious Taliban combed Kabul for those who had collaborated with the West. Rumors circulated that flights were taking passengers even without passports and tickets."
