    "body": "Covid-19 vaccination rates are ticking upward across the U.S., federal officials said, particularly in areas where the Delta variant is hitting hardest.<br />Worries about the virus, growing confidence in the safety of vaccines and the influence of family and friends are all likely contributing to the increase in vaccine uptake, health authorities and residents say. More employers are also starting to institute vaccine mandates. The U.S. has administered more than 864,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the past 24 hours, including 585,000 first shots, White House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Jeff Zients said Thursday during a media briefing.<br />“Clearly, Americans are seeing the impact of being unvaccinated and unprotected,” said Mr. Zients.<br />The U.S. is currently averaging more than 89,400 Covid-19 cases a day, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said at the briefing. Hospitalizations, now about 7,300 a day, are up 41% from the previous week, and the U.S. is averaging about 381 Covid-related deaths a day.<br />Seven states—Florida, Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri and Alabama—account for about half of new cases and hospitalizations, while making up less than a quarter of the U.S. population, Mr. Zients said."
