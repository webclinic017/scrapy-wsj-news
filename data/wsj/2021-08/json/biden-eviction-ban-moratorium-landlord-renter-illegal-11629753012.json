    "body": "There are a few obvious economic consequences of the illegal extension of the eviction ban (“The Supreme Court’s Eviction Docket,” Review & Outlook, Aug. 14). Most important, the supply of rental properties will fall as new construction is deemed not worth the risk and some existing units are converted to other uses. The costs will naturally tend to fall most heavily on the poor.<br />The demands placed on potential lessors are already becoming enormous. Credit reports will be scrutinized and employment status judged. Security deposits will soar and prepayment of many months of rent will be required. There are anecdotal reports of cases in which the lessee has been required to prepay an entire year’s rent. The problems all this creates for the poor will of course necessitate new regulation and government “investment.”<br />Em. Prof. Richard Wallace<br />Wofford College<br />Spartanburg, S.C."
