    "body": "The disengagement from Afghanistan should have gone in the following order: First, the removal of noncombat U.S. citizens and those Afghans in danger of retribution. Second, the removal, to the extent possible, of military equipment and the destruction of anything left behind. Third, after our people and equipment have been removed, our troops could come home. The Biden administration reversed steps one and three and skipped the second (“Biden to Afghanistan: Drop Dead,” Review & Outlook, Aug. 17). This isn’t a criticism of ending the war, only how it was managed. The chaos was completely predictable and avoidable.<br />André Montero<br />Brooklyn, N.Y.<br /><br />Search as one might, there is no word but “weakness” that could characterize President Biden’s decision. It showed the weakness of the U.S. and its allies to hold back the Taliban fanatics. It showed a weakness to the world community, that the U.S. will stand by neither forces that we fought alongside nor people for whom we fought. When we threatened to leave if the opponent didn’t agree to a deal involving our leaving, it showed a weakness of understanding of what negotiation is all about. As I asked President Ashraf Ghani, a former colleague, “What are we negotiating for and what are we negotiating with?”"
