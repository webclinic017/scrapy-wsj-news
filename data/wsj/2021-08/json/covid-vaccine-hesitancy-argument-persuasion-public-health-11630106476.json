    "body": "In his op-ed “A Better Way to Encourage Vaccination” (Aug. 23), Dr. Richard Menger describes a powerful shift in perspective that draws on 40 years of studies showing that arguing with someone is not an effective way to build motivation. The more you oppose someone, the more she will dig in to her position.<br />Developed at the University of California, San Francisco Center for Excellence in Primary Care, the Hear Technique is a simple way to respectfully engage with people who are skeptical or have strong emotions about the vaccine. “Hear” is an acronym that stands for: hear, express appreciation, ask about pros and cons, and respond.<br />Hear. Use an open-ended question to invite the person to share more about her perspective. Or use reflective listening to show the person that she has been heard.<br />Express appreciation. It is a gift when someone shares her reasoning for not following your recommendation. Showing gratitude lets the person know that you respect her and will engage in nonjudgmental conversation.<br />Ask about pros and cons. Most people have arguments on each side of the question. Understanding personal motivations can open doors to more discussion."
