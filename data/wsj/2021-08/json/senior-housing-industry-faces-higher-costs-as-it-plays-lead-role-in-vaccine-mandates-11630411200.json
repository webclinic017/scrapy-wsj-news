    "body": "The senior housing business, which was one of the hardest-hit commercial property sectors early in the pandemic, is now getting hammered by rising labor costs as it takes a lead role in mandating vaccines for employees.<br />Within weeks, nursing homes that don’t require workers to be vaccinated against Covid-19 won’t be able to participate in Medicare or Medicaid, the Biden administration said in early August. Meanwhile, more of the largest private-pay senior housing owners and managers either are requiring or are in the process of mandating staff vaccinations."
