    "body": "Splitting hairs on the definition of “gain of function” research is not productive (“Anthony Fauci, Rand Paul and Wuhan,” Review & Outlook, July 26). Despite the federal government’s 2014 definition, genetically modifying a pathogen to increase its transmissivity to human cells—as the Wuhan Institute of Virology was doing—must count. Sen. Paul is correct and Dr. Fauci demonstrated that he is a political, not medical, animal.<br />What was the purpose of funding research at the Wuhan lab given its collaboration with the People’s Liberation Army? I beg to differ with your statement that “the reality is complicated.”<br />A quote by Pope Benedict XVI is appropriate for the gain-of-function debate: “Science becomes pathological and a threat to life when it takes leave of the moral order of human life, becomes autonomous, and no longer recognizes any standard but its own capabilities.”<br />Richard W. Hurst, Ph.D.<br />Thousand Oaks, Calif."
