    "body": "ALBANY, N.Y.—Melissa DeRosa, the top aide to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, said Sunday night she was resigning, as the Democratic governor faces a possible impeachment over sexual-harassment charges as well as a criminal investigation.<br />Ms. DeRosa was mentioned multiple times in a report issued Tuesday by state Attorney General Letitia James that found Mr. Cuomo violated state and federal sexual-harassment laws when he inappropriately hugged, kissed, touched and commented about 11 women—most of whom are current or former state employees.<br />The governor has denied inappropriately touching anybody and said Ms. James’s report was biased.<br />In a statement, Ms. DeRosa said the past two years have been “emotionally and mentally trying” and thanked New Yorkers and her colleagues. Her colleagues have described her as a fierce defender of the governor and someone who worked almost incessantly in her position as secretary to the governor—the highest-ranking staff position in state government.<br />Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."
