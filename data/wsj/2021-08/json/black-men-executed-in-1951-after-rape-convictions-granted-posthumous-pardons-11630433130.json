    "body": "Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam granted posthumous pardons on Tuesday for seven Black men, known as the “Martinsville Seven,” who were executed decades ago after all-white juries convicted them of raping a white woman.<br />The Democratic governor said the young men, most of whom were between 18 and 21 years old, weren’t given fair due process and their executions were racially biased due to how the death sentence was used in cases involving white defendants, a statement from his office said.<br />“This is about righting wrongs,” Mr. Northam said. “We all deserve a criminal justice system that is fair, equal, and gets it right—no matter who you are or what you look like.”<br />Mr. Northam’s office said the pardons don’t have to do with the mens’ guilt but rather their “unjust, racial-biased sentences” and “disturbing lack of due process.” The seven men were convicted and sentenced in eight days in 1951, the governor’s office said, with some defendants “impaired” when they were arrested, unable to read their signed confessions or without attorneys present.<br />More than two decades after their executions, the Supreme Court ruled the death penalty was unconstitutional punishment for rape."
