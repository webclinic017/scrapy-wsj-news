    "body": "WASHINGTON—Three vaccinated U.S. senators said Thursday they had tested positive for Covid-19 and were all experiencing mild symptoms.<br />Sens. Angus King (I., Maine), Roger Wicker (R., Miss.) and John Hickenlooper (D., Colo.) said that they were experiencing breakthrough Covid-19 cases, despite having been vaccinated earlier. All three lawmakers said they were isolating themselves and following their doctors’ orders. The Senate has been on recess since the middle of last week.<br />Mr. King said in a statement that he had gotten tested after feeling mildly feverish on Wednesday.<br />“While I am not feeling great, I’m definitely feeling much better than I would have without the vaccine,” Mr. King said. “I am taking this diagnosis very seriously, quarantining myself at home and telling the few people I’ve been in contact with to get tested in order to limit any further spread.”<br />A spokesman for Mr. Wicker said he tested positive Thursday morning after experiencing mild symptoms. The lawmaker “is in good health” and is currently isolating, according to his office."
