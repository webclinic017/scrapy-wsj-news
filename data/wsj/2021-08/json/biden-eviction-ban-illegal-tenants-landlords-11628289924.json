    "body": "I join the editorial board in befuddlement at “The Rental Evictions Fiasco” (Aug. 2). When the federal government requires a landlord to give away a rental unit to a tenant, it is an unconstitutional “taking” of the landlord’s property. At a minimum, landlords should be able to apply directly for compensation from the $43 billion of undistributed rental relief funds appropriated by Congress. This really isn’t that complicated.<br />Landlords have every incentive to work with tenants to accommodate temporary financial issues. Which landlord would evict a good, longstanding tenant for a delay in paying a few months rent during a pandemic? A problem tenant who has no intention of ever paying the rent is a different kettle of fish. A return to individual choice and accountability would be good for our country.<br />Chad King<br />Bluffton, S.C.<br />"
