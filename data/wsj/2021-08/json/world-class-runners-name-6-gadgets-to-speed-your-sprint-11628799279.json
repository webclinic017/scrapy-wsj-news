    "body": "ON AUG. 7, Molly Seidel dramatically overturned the odds to take bronze in the Olympic women’s marathon. But the 27-year-old from rural Wisconsin almost didn’t make the podium.<br />“As we were leaving the hotel, I said, ‘We should take the medal ceremony kit [the outfit all athletes wear on the podium] just in case,’” said Ms. Seidel’s coach, former professional runner Jon Green. “She said ‘Why?’ but I had a feeling that something special might happen.”<br />Though the Olympic race was only the third time the runner had attempted a full marathon distance, something special did happen: She became the third U.S. woman to ever claim an Olympic marathon medal.<br />“Seeing Molly on that podium was amazing, because at the end of the day she’s just a normal person—but she’s doing incredible things,” the coach said.<br />The good news for real “just normal” runners: It’s easier than ever to channel our inner Olympians. A gaggle of gadgets to help push us further and faster are increasingly accessible, thanks to rapid advances in wearable technology."
