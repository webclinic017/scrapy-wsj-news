    "body": "U.S. stock futures wavered, putting major indexes on course to end a muted week close to record highs, as investors drew confidence from a blockbuster round of earnings.<br />Futures for the S&P 500 edged up 0.1% Friday. The broad gauge of large-cap stocks climbed Thursday to its 47th all-time closing high of 2021 and has risen for five of the past six trading days.<br />Contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which also hit a record, ticked up 0.2% Friday. Futures on the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 were up less than 0.1%.<br />Walt  Disney  shares jumped 5% ahead of the bell in New York after posting $918 million in profit for its fiscal third quarter compared with a loss of $4.72 billion in the same period last year. Moderna rose 2.1% and  Pfizer  edged up 0.2% after the Food and Drug Administration authorized booster shots for certain people with weakened immune systems.<br />Stocks have ground higher in thin summer trading, bolstered by a rapid pace of earnings growth at the biggest American companies, even as the spread of the Delta variant threatens to sap some speed from the economic recovery. Companies including Disney and  Tyson Foods  posted a big jump in profits this week, and 86% of S&P 500 constituents that have filed quarterly reports have beaten analystsâ€™ expectations."
