    "body": "Josiah Peña spent many hours staring at a computer screen for online classes during his senior year at San Jose State University, and he was facing even more screen time when he landed a remote internship in 2020.<br />That’s when he decided to order blue-light-blocking eyeglasses on  Amazon .  They soothe eye fatigue, some reviews said. They are snake oil, some doctors warned. At least most everyone agrees on one thing: They make you look really hot.<br />As soon as Mr. Peña, 24, got a wide pair with black frames to complement his self-described “big face,” co-workers and friends started pointing out how great he looked in them and asking, “Where did you get those?”<br />Mr. Peña thinks the glasses help with screen fatigue, but even if that’s all psychological and not backed by science, the glasses are worth the $25 price.<br />“I still use them quite often,” says Mr. Peña. “Sometimes I wear them when I go out because I like the look.”"
