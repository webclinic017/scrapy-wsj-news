    "body": "At first blush, small-cap stocks look like a bargain. But dig deeper and the story gets more complicated.<br />One common way to gauge whether a stock is looking expensive is to divide its price by the company’s earnings. By one measure, the Russell 2000 benchmark, whose members have an average market capitalization of about $3.3 billion, recently traded at about 19 times its past year’s earnings, while the large-cap Russell 1000 index traded at 25 times—making the small-cap segment seem like a deal.<br />However, when calculating the price-to-earnings ratio, analysts sometimes—as in the figures just cited—cut out the companies that don’t turn a profit. This can have a dramatic effect on how pricey a broad swath of the market appears, especially since the share of the small-cap index without profits, high to begin with, surged in the aftermath of the pandemic-induced recession.<br />For the Russell 2000 benchmark, leaving out the unprofitable companies means setting aside what for the past year has amounted to more than one third of the market value of the small-cap index, according to an analysis from Jefferies looking at earnings over the previous 12 months.<br />In comparison, only about 8% of the large-cap Russell 1000 index, whose members have an average market capitalization of about $511 billion, was made up of unprofitable companies at last count."
