    "body": "Pfizer Inc.’s  ability to supply billions of doses of its Covid-19 vaccine hinges on two employees working on opposite sides of the world.<br />From her home in Andover, Mass., Amy Genest scouts for companies that can make Pfizer’s shot. After finding a partner, she hands over the project to Poonam Mulherkar, an engineer in Gandhinagar, India, who manages the top-secret transfer of the vaccine’s blueprint and manufacturing.<br />The women belong to a select group of drug-industry staff who may hold the key to helping countries overcome limited supplies of doses—and accelerating the world’s vaccination campaign against the pandemic.<br />Vaccine makers like Pfizer, though they have significantly increased their output of shots, can only make so much at their own plants. Mses. Genest and Mulherkar are among a relatively small number of professionals with the rare skill set to enable other companies to produce the shots.<br />Their work, requiring expertise in biochemical engineering to pharmaceutical manufacturing, is called technology transfer."
