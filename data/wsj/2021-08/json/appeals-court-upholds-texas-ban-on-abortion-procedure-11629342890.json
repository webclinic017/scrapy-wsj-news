    "body": "NEW ORLEANS—A Texas law outlawing an abortion method commonly used to end second-trimester pregnancies was upheld Wednesday by a federal appeals court in New Orleans.<br />The 2017 law has never been enforced. It seeks to prohibit the use of forceps to remove a fetus from the womb—what supporters of the law call a “dismemberment abortion”—without first using an injected drug or a suction procedure to ensure the fetus is dead.<br />Abortion-rights advocates argued that the law, known as SB8 in court records, effectively outlaws what is often the safest method of abortion for women in the second trimester of pregnancy—a procedure medically known as dilation and evacuation. They also argued that fetuses cannot feel pain during the gestation period affected by the law, and that one alternative outlined by the state, the use of suction to remove a fetus, also results in dismemberment.<br />A three-judge panel of the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked enforcement of the law last year. But Texas sought, and was granted, a rehearing by the full court.<br />A majority among the 14 appellate judges who heard arguments in January (three of the court’s 17 active judges were recused) sided with Texas. The opinion, by judges Jennifer Walker Elrod and Don Willett, said “the record shows that doctors can safely perform D&Es and comply with SB8 using methods that are already in widespread use.”"
