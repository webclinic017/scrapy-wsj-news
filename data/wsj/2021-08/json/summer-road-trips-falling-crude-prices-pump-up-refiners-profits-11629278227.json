    "body": "Summer road trips and a pullback in crude prices have pumped up refineries’ profits, offering brighter prospects for one part of the global oil complex despite rising worries about Covid-19.<br />Oil prices have grown choppy in recent weeks since China, the world’s biggest commodities consumer, imposed restrictions to contain the Delta coronavirus variant. A decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and the cartel’s other partners to pump more oil is also weighing on crude markets.<br />Prices for West Texas Intermediate, the main grade of U.S. crude, are down more than 10% from their 2021 high, trading at about $66.59 a barrel.<br />The retreat is weighing on shares of energy companies including Exxon Mobil Corp., but is a potential boon for refiners such as  Marathon Petroleum Corp.  Refiners stand to gain when gasoline and other products they produce fetch higher prices than the crude they purchase.<br />Refiners had already benefited from a summer surge in gasoline demand that pushed average pump prices above $3.15 a gallon. Investors haven’t rewarded their share prices, however, in part because of rising costs for meeting environmental rules."
