    "body": "A recommendation by a National Labor Relations Board official has opened the door for a redo of a unionization vote at an  Amazon . com Inc. facility in Alabama, renewing the possibility for a breakthrough victory for organized labor.<br />But the union leading the organizing effort is likely to face an arduous process and stiff opposition as it seeks to hold a new election, former labor officials and labor attorneys said. The outcome of any new vote also may not change from when workers voted against organizing in April, they added.<br />The first step toward a potential new vote will start at the NLRB’s regional level, where a director will review the recommendation for a fresh election issued Monday by agency hearing officer Kerstin Meyers.<br />Amazon said it plans to contest Ms. Meyer’s recommendation with the regional director, who could issue a decision in the next several weeks.<br />“Our employees had a chance to be heard during a noisy time when all types of voices were weighing into the national debate,” the company said on Monday. “Their voice should be heard above all else.”"
