    "body": "A tanker ship in the Gulf of Oman was seized Tuesday by suspected Iranian gunmen, Western officials said, amid rising regional tensions following a fatal drone attack on another vessel that the U.S. and its allies have blamed on the Islamic Republic.<br />The tanker was boarded near the port of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates, according to the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which is affiliated with the British Defense Ministry.<br />In recent years, Iran’s Navy has often seized oil tankers it accuses of smuggling oil in its waters. But the latest incident comes on the heels of last week’s attack on an Israeli-linked tanker in the nearby Arabian Sea, which the U.S., the U.K. and Israel blamed on Iran. The deaths of two crew members, a British national and a Romanian national, were the first after numerous strikes blamed on Iran and Israel in recent years on ships in the region.<br />Tehran has denied involvement in last week’s attack and said it wouldn’t hesitate to defend its interests following rivals’ threats that they would retaliate.<br />On Tuesday, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh denied that the country’s armed forces had boarded the ship. He described the recent incidents as suspicious and warned against making accusations for political purposes."
