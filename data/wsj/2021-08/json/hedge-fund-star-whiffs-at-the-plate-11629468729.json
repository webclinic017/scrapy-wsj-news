    "body": "Oh, somewhere in this favoured land the sun is shining bright. The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light. And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout, but there is no joy at Mudrick—mighty Jason has struck out.<br />Hedge-fund manager Jason Mudrick is about as clutch a player as you can find in the financial world, named among “the hottest hands in hedge funds” by Institutional Investor and even one of “the sexiest hedge-fund managers alive” by Business Insider. But his attempt to snap up a piece of baseball history was a swing and a miss.<br />As chairman and chief executive of blank check firm Mudrick Capital Acquisition Corp II, he sealed a deal in April to buy baseball card seller Topps, valuing the company at $1.3 billion. Shares of the acquirer, which represent $10 in cash, went as high as $18.78.<br />But they fell below $10 on Friday following Thursday’s news that Major League Baseball is dropping its six decade relationship with Topps. All it will have left is Major League Soccer and the National Hockey League.<br />That is rotten news for Mudrick, which terminated the merger on Friday, but even worse for Topps. Maybe it can diversify into hedge-fund manager trading cards."
