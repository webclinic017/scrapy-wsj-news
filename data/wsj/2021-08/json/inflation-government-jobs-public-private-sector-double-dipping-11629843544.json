    "body": "Regarding Phil Gramm and Mike Solon’s op-ed “Inflation Punishes the Unprotected” (Aug. 12): Unlike many government employees, average working Americans have no guaranteed income, no cost-of-living or nonmerit regular raises, no access to inexpensive, excellent health insurance, no on-site child care and no lifetime promise of either employment or benefits.<br />Americans in the private sector also cannot “double dip”—retire from their current position and collect benefits, then return to their job and collect a salary. In 2013, nearly 20% of Congress received a government pension alongside a congressional salary, but this practice isn’t limited to Congress. Its benefits can be enjoyed by many government employees.<br />Washington doesn’t live by the same rules and under the same conditions as average Americans. The Biden administration feels that it can throw money at everything without consequence, and that’s because there is none for them—only the upside of more votes. It’s the taxpayer who will foot the bill and struggle to live within a budget, not the government. Although the public sector complains its members are not compensated what they are worth in the private sector, the trade-off in job and wage security and peace of mind must be worth it.<br />Jan T. McCarthy<br />Keswick, Va."
