    "body": "NEW YORK—One of Jeffrey Epstein’s longtime accusers filed a lawsuit against Prince Andrew Monday, taking accusations that he sexually assaulted her when she was 17 to a formal venue.<br />Lawyers for Virginia Giuffre filed the lawsuit in Manhattan federal court, where Epstein was charged criminally with sex trafficking a month before he killed himself in August 2019 at an adjacent federal jail.<br />Ms. Giuffre has repeatedly made her allegations against Epstein, his onetime girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell and Prince Andrew, but the lawsuit is the first time she has directly confronted the prince in such a formal setting.<br />In late 2019, Prince Andrew told the British Broadcast Corp. that he had never had sex with Ms. Giuffre. He said he has “no recollection” of ever meeting her and told an interviewer there are “a number of things that are wrong” about Ms. Giuffre’s account, which alleges the encounter occurred in 2001.<br />In a statement, Ms. Giuffre said she was “holding Prince Andrew accountable for what he did to me.”"
