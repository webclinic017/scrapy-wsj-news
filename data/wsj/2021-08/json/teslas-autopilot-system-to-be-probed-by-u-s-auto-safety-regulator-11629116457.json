    "body": "U.S. auto safety regulators are investigating  Tesla Inc.’s  advanced driver-assistance system known as Autopilot after a series of crashes at emergency scenes.<br />The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a document made public Monday that it had identified 11 crashes since early 2018 in which a Tesla vehicle that had been using the company’s driver-assistance system struck one or more vehicles involved in an emergency-response situation. Four of those crashes happened this year.<br />“Most incidents took place after dark and the crash scenes encountered included scene control measures such as first responder vehicle lights, flares, an illuminated arrow board, and road cones,” the agency said.<br />NHTSA is studying the Autopilot system in some 765,000 Tesla vehicles from the 2014 through 2021 model years.<br />NHTSA has been looking more closely at advanced driver-assistance systems such as Autopilot as they have become more ubiquitous in vehicles on roads today. The agency recently began requiring companies to regularly report crashes involving advanced driver-assistance or automated driving systems to the agency."
