    "body": "Republican lawmakers in Texas sent a voting bill to GOP Gov. Greg Abbott after overcoming months of hurdles by Democrats who sought to kill the legislation, including through a July walkout that saw many leave the state for Washington, D.C.<br />The bill, which Republicans say is a way to enhance election security, would broadly tighten voting procedures across the state. Democrats say it would restrict access to the polls, especially for minorities.<br />Gov. Abbott supports the measure and said Tuesday that he looks forward to signing it into law.<br />The battle over the bill is part of a national debate over voting rules following President Biden’s election, which former President Donald Trump and some of his supporters claim was illegitimate, though no court has found evidence of widespread voter fraud.<br />In recent months, states including Florida and Georgia passed GOP-led measures placing more restrictions on certain types of voting, drawing pushback from civil-rights groups, companies and Democrats across the U.S."
