    "body": "Jobless claims likely held near a pandemic low last week, a sign the job-market recovery remains on sound footing despite uncertainty surrounding the Delta variant of Covid-19.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimate that the Labor Department will report that unemployment claims were 350,000 last week, nearly the same as 348,000 a week earlier, the lowest level for claims since March 2020.<br />Applications for unemployment benefits are down more than 50% since the start of the year. They have continued to fall this summer, despite a surge in the Delta variant that has resulted in rising Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations throughout the country.<br />“Even with the spread of the Delta variant, many people who are vaccinated feel more comfortable doing things than they did previously,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group Inc. “Demand for labor remains very strong.”<br />Continuing claims for regular state programs, a proxy for the number of people receiving benefits, have also recently declined to pandemic lows. About 2.82 million people were collecting benefits through state programs in the week ended Aug. 7, compared with 14.22 million people a year earlier."
