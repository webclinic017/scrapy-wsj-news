    "body": "A large portion of the Afghan Air Force has ended up in neighboring Uzbekistan, after hundreds of Afghan service members used U.S.-supplied planes and helicopters to flee the Taliban, U.S. officials said.<br />At least 46 of the aircraft crossed over Afghanistan’s border into Uzbekistan since last weekend, when the Taliban seized Kabul and the government collapsed, U.S. officials said. The planes and helicopters carried a total of 585 members of Afghan forces with them, the officials said.<br />A handful of airplanes also ended up in Tajikistan, also on Afghanistan’s northern border.<br />The U.S. embassies of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.<br />The migration of the aircraft comes as Washington is only beginning to tally up how much of the billions of dollars in U.S.-supplied hardware has ended up with the Taliban."
