    "body": "HONG KONG—A Chinese court sentenced entrepreneur Michael Spavor to 11 years in prison on espionage charges in the first of two national-security cases involving Canadian citizens that sit at the center of a fierce standoff between China and both Canada and the U.S.<br />Mr. Spavor was found guilty of “probing into and illegally providing state secrets” to foreign actors, said the Dandong Intermediate People’s Court in northeastern Liaoning province on its website on Wednesday.<br />The court said Mr. Spavor would also have about $7,700 worth of personal assets confiscated.<br />The verdict follows Mr. Spavor’s trial in March, which was concluded by the Dandong court in a matter of hours. The hearing had been closed to the public because it involved state secrets, the court said at the time.<br />Mr. Spavor will have 10 days to appeal the court’s decision, said Jim Nickel, Canadian deputy ambassador to China, in a press briefing held in Beijing on Wednesday."
