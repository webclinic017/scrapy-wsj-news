    "body": "U.S. stock futures wavered ahead of a series of earnings reports and fresh data on the labor market that is expected to provide insight into the pace of the recovery.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were relatively flat after both indexes notched records on Wednesday. Nasdaq-100 futures edged down 0.2%, pointing to muted declines in technology stocks after the opening bell.<br />A clutch of technology companies are scheduled to report earnings Thursday.  Palantir Technologies  is slated to post results in the morning ahead of the opening bell.  Airbnb  and  DoorDash  are expected to report after markets close, as well as Walt  Disney .<br />“Earnings season is going really well, it validates the recovery scenario,” said Luc Filip, head of private banking investments at SYZ Private Banking. “The recovery will enter this growth phase and how big this growth will be is the key question for us.”<br />In premarket trading,South Korean e-commerce company  Coupang  dropped 6% after posting quarterly results that included a nearly $300 million hit from a fire at a fulfillment center. If sustained, the drop would take shares of the  SoftBank Group -backed company below their March initial public offering price."
