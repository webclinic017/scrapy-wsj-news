    "body": "The Biden American Families Plan envisions a dystopia for upper-income taxpayers. But what are the odds it will be enacted? The election was decided by the narrowest of margins, and the bill will receive no support from Republicans. Vice President Kamala Harris will need to cast the deciding vote in a 50-50 Senate. The need to herd 50 Democrats should moderate the tax measures that President Biden has proposed.<br />How will this play out? Fortunately, today’s sophisticated financial professionals have state-of-the-art prediction tools on their desks that let them peer into the future. Join me in consulting the Magic 8-Ball.<br />Will the tax bill be passed with enough time for us to respond before it takes effect Jan. 1?<br />“Ask again later.” Congress will pass the bill between Oct. 1 (under budget “reconciliation”) and the end of the year. The party in power always claims to be seeking support from across the aisle, but by the end of the year they can do what they were planning anyway and claim the opposition refused to cooperate.<br />Will my income-tax rates go up?"
