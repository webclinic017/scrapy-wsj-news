    "body": "BOSTON—Elisabeth Kimmel, a former media executive from La Jolla, Calif., has agreed to plead guilty for her role in a nationwide college-admissions scandal, heading off a trial that was scheduled to begin next month.<br />Ms. Kimmel, 57 years old, allegedly paid more than a half-million dollars to a corrupt college counselor to slot a daughter into Georgetown University and a son into the University of Southern California as athletes, even though they weren’t competitive players. She agreed Thursday to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, according to a plea agreement filed in Boston federal court.<br />Under her plea arrangement, Ms. Kimmel and prosecutors agreed to a sentence of six weeks in prison and two years of supervised release, the first of which would be under house arrest. She also would be required to pay a $250,000 fine and perform 500 hours of community service, according to the plea deal. The judge in the case isn’t required to accept the agreed-upon sentence.<br />Ms. Kimmel is set to be the 45th defendant to plead guilty in the sprawling investigation known as Operation Varsity Blues. Fifty-seven people have been charged since the case came to light in March 2019 and several are slated to go to trial this fall.<br />Her attorney, Eoin P. Beirne, couldn’t immediately be reached for comment."
