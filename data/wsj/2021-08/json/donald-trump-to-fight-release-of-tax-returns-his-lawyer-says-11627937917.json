    "body": "WASHINGTON—Former President Donald Trump will fight any move by the Treasury Department to turn over his tax returns to Congress, a lawyer for Mr. Trump said Monday, days after the Justice Department directed the agency to provide the documents to a House panel.<br />“There is no evidence of any wrongdoing here and I object to the release of the returns not only on behalf of my client but on behalf of all future holders of the office of the president of the United States,” said Ronald Fischetti, a lawyer for Mr. Trump.<br />The Treasury Department told a federal judge Friday it intended to comply with the House Ways and Means Committee’s request for the documents, in light of the Justice Department’s new opinion, but would give Mr. Trump a reasonable opportunity to raise objections. If the committee receives the records, it could release at least some of them to the public.<br />A judge asked the parties to lay out a time frame for written arguments by Wednesday. It could take months before the judge ultimately decides whether the Treasury Department must hand over the returns to Congress. That ruling could then be appealed.<br />The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Monday."
