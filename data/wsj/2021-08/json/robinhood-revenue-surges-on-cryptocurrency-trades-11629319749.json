    "body": "Revenue at  Robinhood Markets Inc.  more than doubled in the second quarter thanks to a torrent of customers trading cryptocurrency, but the company posted a big loss due to an emergency funding deal earlier this year.<br />The trading app recorded a loss of $502 million, or $2.16 per share, on revenue of $565 million in its first earnings report since its July initial public offering. In the second quarter of 2020, Robinhood generated a profit of $58 million on revenue of $244 million.<br />More than 60% of the 22.5 million Robinhood customers that have funded accounts traded bitcoin, dogecoin or other digital assets in the second quarter. Robinhood earned $233 million in fees from routing customers’ cryptocurrency trades to high-speed trading firms, up from just $5 million a year earlier.<br />That helped offset slowdowns in other parts of Robinhood’s business due in part to waning interest in meme stocks. For instance, fees Robinhood earned executing customers’ stock trades fell 27% to $52 million.<br />Write to Peter Rudegeair at Peter.Rudegeair@wsj.com"
