Recently, however, the level of uncertainty tormenting markets has been even higher than usual. Inflation is high, the Delta variant is rampant and President Biden’s economic agenda hangs by a thread.<br />Yet one thing we can say confidently about the economy right now is that companies really, really need workers. And that seems likely to be true for a while—barring a truly catastrophic Delta outbreak this fall.<br />Staffing companies such as  Robert Half International ,  a California-based firm focusing on temporary and permanent hiring solutions for accounting, administration, information technology and other needs, look well placed to benefit from this trend. After a traumatic 2020, the company posted a record net income of $149 million for the second quarter, up 223% from a year earlier.<br />It is more richly priced than some competitors at 20 times next 12 months’ expected earnings, according to FactSet, but that may be because its large U.S. exposure and focus on high-demand industries give it a leg up in the current environment. And despite the tailwinds from the general scramble for workers, it is still cheaper than the S&P 500 as a whole, which will cost you 21 times expected earnings."
