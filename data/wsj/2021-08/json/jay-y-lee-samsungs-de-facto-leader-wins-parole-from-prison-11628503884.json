    "body": "SEOUL— Samsung ’s  de facto leader, Lee Jae-yong, will be released from prison on parole later this week, though it remains unclear how—or if—he can return to work right away at South Korea’s largest conglomerate.<br />Mr. Lee, who had been serving a 30-month prison sentence for bribing South Korea’s ex-president, was among a list of inmates granted parole at a Monday review meeting, according to South Korea’s justice ministry. He is expected to be released on Friday.<br />Mr. Lee, also known as Jay Y. Lee, plays a vital role atop a business enterprise that spans dozens of affiliates, including its crown jewel electronics division that is the world’s largest maker of smartphones, semiconductors and televisions. Major decisions require his signoff.<br />But the 53-year-old grandson of Samsung’s founder may not be allowed to resume his duties. Under South Korean law, individuals who commit economic crimes are subject to a five-year employment ban, while those paroled face restrictions on overseas travel.<br />The Justice Ministry, which approves such exemptions, didn’t comment on the matter. In a briefing on Monday evening, Justice Minister Park Beom-kye said Mr. Lee’s parole had factored in “the nation’s economic situation due to the prolonged Covid-19 pandemic, as well as the global economic environment.”"
