    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden vigorously defended the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, saying his administration had evacuated the vast majority of Americans who wanted to leave the country and would refrain from future military action that lacked “clear achievable goals.”<br />“I was not going to extend this forever war, and I was not extending a forever exit,” Mr. Biden said in a speech from the White House.<br />Mr. Biden’s handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan has been widely criticized by Republicans and some members of his own party. On Tuesday, he emphatically argued that it was the right decision and called the evacuations of Americans an “extraordinary success.”<br />The president addressed the nation a day after the final plane carrying American troops departed Afghanistan, formally marking the end of the nation’s longest war. The president said his administration would continue to help Americans exit the country, saying 100 to 200 of them remained after more than 5,500 Americans had gotten out before the withdrawal ended.<br />After campaigning on completing the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, Mr. Biden and top administration officials have been confronted by images of chaos as Afghans seek to flee the country and the deaths of 13 service members and dozens of Afghans in a terrorist attack attributed to ISIS-K at the Kabul airport."
