    "body": "Britney Spears’s father said in a new court filing he would step down at some point from the helm of the controversial conservatorship that has governed the pop star’s personal life and roughly $60 million estate for the last 13 years.<br />The court documents, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Thursday, come weeks after the 39-year-old star asked a judge presiding over the case to remove her father, James P. Spears, calling the conservatorship “abusive.”<br />A new lawyer for Ms. Spears, Mathew Rosengart, has moved aggressively in recent weeks to remove or suspend Mr. Spears. It is part of a broader effort to terminate the conservatorship over Ms. Spears, an obscure legal arrangement that has been in place since 2008 when it was instituted for her protection due to mental-health issues and potential substance abuse. Ms. Spears acknowledged its necessity at the time.<br />Mr. Spears maintained that there are “no actual grounds for suspending or removing” him, but said that he “does not believe a public battle with his daughter over his continuing service as her conservator would be in her best interests.\"<br />“There are no urgent circumstances justifying Mr. Spears’s immediate suspension,” the filing states. “It is highly debatable whether a change in conservator at this time would be in Ms. Spears’s best interests.”"
