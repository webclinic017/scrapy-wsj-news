    "body": "U.S. stock futures edged higher Tuesday as investors awaited more corporate earnings reports to assess the business climate.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 ticked up 0.4%, pointing to the broad market benchmark recovering ground at the opening bell after shedding 0.2% on Monday. Contracts tied to the Nasdaq-100 gained 0.2%, and futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.5%.<br />A strong spate of corporate results has helped bolster optimism that stocks can continue to grind higher following an already strong rally this year. Investors say continued support from central banks and economic data that still shows growth will further support equities.<br />“It has been a pretty strong earnings season and that justifies the medium-term positive view that we have on stocks,” said Justin Onuekwusi, head of retail multiasset funds at Legal & General Investment Management. “Earnings typically always beat the average analyst estimate, but for the second quarter in a row, they are coming in above the highest estimates, which is pretty unprecedented.”<br />Lyft ,   Activision  Blizzard and  Amgen  are among the companies that will post results after markets close."
