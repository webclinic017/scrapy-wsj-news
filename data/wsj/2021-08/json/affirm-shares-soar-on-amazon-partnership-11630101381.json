    "body": "Amazon.com Inc.  is joining with  Affirm Holdings Inc.  to allow customers to pay for purchases via monthly installments, signaling further growth in the buy-now, pay-later space.<br />Snagging a big e-commerce player such as Amazon as a partner sent Affirm’s shares soaring 30% after hours to around $88. The firm sold shares at $49 apiece in its initial public offering in January.<br />Affirm’s other partners include  Walmart Inc.,   Expedia Group Inc.  and  Peloton Interactive Inc.<br />Amazon said it was testing Affirm’s buy-now, pay-later payment option with some customers and would make the method more broadly available in the coming months.<br />Amazon already offers U.S. customers a few installment options, such as monthly payment plans for Amazon-branded credit-card holders and  Citigroup Inc.  credit-card users."
