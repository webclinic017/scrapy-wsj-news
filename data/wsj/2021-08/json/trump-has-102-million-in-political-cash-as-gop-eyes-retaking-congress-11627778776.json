    "body": "Former President Donald Trump has $102 million in political cash he can wield as the GOP eyes retaking majorities in Congress next year, according to filings made Saturday night with the Federal Election Commission.<br />Mr. Trump’s political-action committees reported receiving $82 million during the first half of the year through June 30, with $62 million of that flowing to Save America PAC, a leadership committee that issues Mr. Trump’s press statements and candidate endorsements.<br />Some of that money came in the form of transfers of donations raised last year, the filings show, a caveat first reported by the New York Times and not mentioned in a statement released by Save America PAC announcing the figure.<br />Trump aides didn’t immediately respond to a question about the accounting.<br />It is early in the midterm election cycle and committees often wait to give to candidates until closer to the start of voting. Mr. Trump’s committees, which can donate $5,000 per election to a campaign, reported no donations to GOP campaigns through June 30."
