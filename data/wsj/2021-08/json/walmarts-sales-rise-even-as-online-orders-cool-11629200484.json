    "body": "Walmart Inc.  logged another quarter of rising U.S. sales even as its online growth slowed, at a time when retailers are navigating rising costs, supply chain snarls and an uptick in Covid-19 cases in many parts of the country.<br />Comparable sales, those from U.S. stores and digital channels operating for at least 12 months, rose 5.2% in the quarter ended July 30 compared with the same period last year. U.S. e-commerce sales rose 6% from a year ago, when Covid restrictions kept many people home.<br />Growth slowed from earlier in the year, both online and off, but was still given a boost by government stimulus dollars and a generally strong U.S. economy, the company said Tuesday. Sales increased each month through the quarter, with July the strongest month, Walmart said.<br />The latest quarterly sales and profits exceeded Wall Street’s estimates. For its fiscal year, Walmart forecast continued sales gains. For the U.S. comparable sales will rise 5% to 6% for the year, Walmart said.<br />More shoppers came to Walmart stores, with U.S. transactions up 6.1% during the quarter, but they spent slightly less per visit, or around 0.8% less versus the same period last year. That’s a flip from earlier pandemic trends when shoppers moved spending online and visited stores less frequently, but spent more each visit."
