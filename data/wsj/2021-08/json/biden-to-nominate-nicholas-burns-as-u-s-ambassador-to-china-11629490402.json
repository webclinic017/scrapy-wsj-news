    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden intends to nominate veteran diplomat Nicholas Burns to serve as U.S. ambassador to China and former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel as his top diplomat in Japan, making two high-profile selections for his U.S. leadership in Asia.<br />Both nominations have been expected, and if confirmed, Messrs. Burns and Emanuel will serve as prominent representatives of Mr. Biden’s agenda in Asia, where the administration faces escalating tensions with China on issues such as trade and human rights.<br />Mr. Burns served as U.S. ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and undersecretary of state for political affairs during the presidency of Republican George W. Bush, and as U.S. ambassador to Greece under President Bill Clinton, a Democrat. He currently teaches at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government.<br />Mr. Burns will face Senate confirmation as the Biden administration has sought to rally allies to counter China’s economic and military presence around the globe.<br />Mr. Emanuel was a White House chief of staff under President Barack Obama and is a former congressman who represented a district in Chicago. Some progressive organizations expressed opposition to the possibility of Mr. Emanuel joining Mr. Biden’s cabinet during the transition, pointing to his handling as Chicago’s mayor of a 2014 police shooting of a Black teenager."
