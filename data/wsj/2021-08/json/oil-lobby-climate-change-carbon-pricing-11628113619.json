    "body": "The goal of the American Petroleum Institute is to maintain our reliance on oil and gas. To expect its help passing effective legislation on climate change is a misplaced expectation (“Oil Lobby Shifted on Climate Policy, and Won Few Friends,” Page One, July 29). The leadership’s statement of support for carbon pricing is a response to growing pressure, but as an organization it is doing all it can to maintain the status quo.<br />Corporations and large trade groups can issue words of support for action on climate change, but they’re only words. When trade associations’ actions start reflecting corporate leadership’s words, then we will have a carbon price with a global impact. We’ll do it without spending trillions, without subsidies and without adding to our government bureaucracy.<br />Craig Preston<br />Costa Mesa, Calif."
