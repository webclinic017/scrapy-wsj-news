    "body": "Soon after President Biden said in April that all U.S. forces would leave Afghanistan by Sept. 11 as part of last year’s peace deal, the Taliban launched an offensive to regain much of the country they once held nearly 20 years ago.<br />In April, the Taliban had already taken control of 73 districts of 421 nationwide.<br />By August, insurgents controlled 222 and were contesting another 114.<br />And now, the speed at which the number of cities and provinces have fallen to the Taliban in the past week—including Kandahar, Afghanistan’s second-largest city and the group’s birthplace—has shocked U.S. and Afghan officials.<br />Before the current Taliban offensive, U.S. officials said they didn’t expect the takeover of any provincial capital until fall, at the earliest."
