    "body": "Three months ago, chip-testing equipment maker  FormFactor  looked like a company in the wrong place at the wrong time. The truth is actually the opposite.<br />Semiconductor stocks were riding high earlier this year amid a chip production shortage that has crippled industries from automotive to consumer electronics. That shortage has driven chip manufacturers to boost expansion plans to keep up with demand, which in turn fueled stock prices in the sector. The PHLX Semiconductor Index hit a decade-high valuation of more than 27 times forward earnings by mid-February.<br />Naturally, that sparked worry among more seasoned investors long accustomed to the chip equipment industry’s cyclical nature. So when FormFactor posted its first-quarter results in late April, investors were looking hard for any signs of a peak. FormFactor’s disappointing gross margin projection for the second quarter triggered a hard selloff, costing the company nearly one-third of its market value over the next two weeks.<br />The stock has recovered only a bit of ground since, putting its year-to-date loss at 19%. By contrast, the 30 largest U.S.-listed companies in the semiconductor equipment space have averaged a year-to-date gain of 24%, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. FormFactor’s share price has budged little since its second-quarter results on July 28 that showed gross margins coming in better than the company had originally expected.<br />A beaten-down stock creates an opportunity, given FormFactor’s unique position to capitalize on shifts going on in semiconductor manufacturing. The company specializes in probe cards that allow semiconductor manufacturers to test chips at the wafer level, thus saving on the cost of separating and packaging bad chips."
