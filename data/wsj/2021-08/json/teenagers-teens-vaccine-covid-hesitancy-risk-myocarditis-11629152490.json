    "body": "In “De Blasio Banishes My Kids From New York” (op-ed, Aug. 10), Ray Prisament acts as if the jury is out regarding the safety of the vaccine for teens. This is far from the truth. Hundreds of thousands of teens have been part of a vaccine trial, and other than a very rare condition called myocarditis, which is usually mild and resolves quickly, little risk has been found. The risk from Covid, however, is real and documented: Some kids get very sick and have long-lasting complications. As of Thursday, 1,785 children were hospitalized across the country. Although there is a risk with any vaccine, the risk of not getting the vaccine is far greater.<br />Cathy Putnam<br />Concord, Mass.<br /><br />Mr. Prisament asks if it matters that, statistically, young people denied access to a New York City diner due to vaccination protocols might be more likely to be black. The answer is no, it matters not a whit which racial or ethnic group listed on the census questionnaire a person belongs to. It is a public-health measure, designed to minimize contact between those who are at the highest risk of being spreaders of the disease and those who are not. Unfortunately, Mr. Prisament’s children currently fall into the former category, and that is the only reason the diner would refuse them entry. It is very reasonable consequence of a choice made by him on their behalf—no more, no less."
