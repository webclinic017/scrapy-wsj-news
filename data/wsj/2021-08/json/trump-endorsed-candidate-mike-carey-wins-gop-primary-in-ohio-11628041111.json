    "body": "In a victory for the Democratic establishment, Cuyahoga County Councilwoman Shontel Brown has won a Democratic primary in Cleveland, defeating a candidate backed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to the Associated Press.<br />The race for the heavily Democratic district, which includes Cleveland, its eastern suburbs and part of Akron, was seen as a proxy fight for the Democratic Party. Ms. Brown had the endorsement of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and influential Biden ally Rep. James Clyburn (D., S.C.), the Democratic whip. The Congressional Black Caucus’s PAC and several pro-Israel organizations also backed Ms. Brown.<br />Former State Sen. Nina Turner, a top surrogate for Mr. Sanders’s (I., Vt.) presidential campaigns who had been seen as Ms. Brown’s top competitor, conceded the race Tuesday night. She had the backing of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and the Congressional Progressive Caucus’s PAC. She was seen as the front-runner for much of the race, but Ms. Brown closed the gap.<br />Because the 11th district is solidly Democratic, Ms. Brown is the favorite to win the general election Nov. 2. She will compete against community activist Laverne Gore, who won the GOP primary Tuesday night, according to the AP.<br />Ms. Brown focused her campaign on working with President Biden and the Democratic Party, marking a contrast with Ms. Turner, who has at times been critical of Mr. Biden."
