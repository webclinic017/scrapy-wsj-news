The Biden administration on Tuesday is set to discuss extending its Aug. 31 deadline to evacuate thousands of people.<br />On Monday, the White House said the U.S. has helped evacuate 48,000 people since Aug. 14. The United Nations Refugee Agency says there are close to 2.5 million registered Afghan refugees around the world."
