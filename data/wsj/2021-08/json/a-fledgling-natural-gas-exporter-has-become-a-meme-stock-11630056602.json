    "body": "Charif Souki has found a new tool in the race to build America’s next shale-gas shipping hub: YouTube.<br />From his home office in Aspen, Colo., the executive who built the first U.S. natural-gas export terminal sits in front of a crowded bookshelf to craft videos once a week for an audience of mostly young, internet-savvy individual investors who have collectively taken a big stake in his fledgling venture,  Tellurian Inc.<br />Mr. Souki, the company’s 68-year-old executive chairman, records monologues about the global gas market and the company’s latest deals on his iPad, and rarely does second takes. He often discusses the investors’ online chatter with his investor- and public-relations team to determine what they want to hear.<br />“We found so far that they’re extremely faithful. They do their homework. They understand exactly where we’re trying to go,” Mr. Souki said of his new fans. “We find the retail market a lot more long-term oriented than the hedge-fund market.”<br />Mr. Souki in 1996 co-founded  Cheniere Energy Inc.,  the first company to take the fruits of fracking and export them to global markets from the U.S. Gulf Coast—in the form of liquefied natural gas, or LNG. He has spent the past several years trying to start construction on a new export plant in Louisiana, but he has had a tough time securing the billions he needs to pull it off."
