    "body": "WASHINGTON—There are people who love ducks. And people who love to hunt ducks.  Both groups are waterfowl fans, but sometimes agendas clash. Feathers are ruffled. This time, it’s over artistic differences.<br />Waterfowl hunters and others who buy hunting licenses known as Federal Duck Stamps are arguing about their imagery. The stamps are collected by non-hunters, often conservationists, bird watchers and wildlife photographers who like the duck-themed artwork.<br />A rule instituted during the Trump administration requires the new hunting stamps to show waterfowl and depict hunting. Some say the rule ought to be killed. Others say hunting stamps ought to reflect hunters’ contribution to conservation.<br />Slightly larger than postage stamps, Duck Stamps cost $25 and must be purchased by waterfowl hunters over age 16. Hunters typically put them on paperwork brought into the field. The stamps feature a new picture each year.<br />The stamps give purchasers access to the country’s network of roughly 570 wildlife refuges. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service dedicates the proceeds to growing and protecting those refuges. It also conducts an annual competition for the stamp’s artwork."
