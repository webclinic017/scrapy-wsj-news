    "body": "A Haitian legal clerk helping investigate the assassination of the country’s president was murdered, his union and colleagues said Thursday, marking a violent turn for authorities pursuing the case.<br />Ernst Lafortune, a clerk working for a tribunal in the country’s capital of Port-au-Prince, had an evening meeting with his superior, Mathieu Chanlatte, a judge investigating the murder of President Jovenel Moïse, the National Association of Haitian Legal Clerks said in a statement. The two had a “lively discussion,” the union said.<br />Hours later, Mr. Lafortune was dropped off by unidentified people at a hospital with broken arms and a gash in his throat, said another legal clerk working with him. At the hospital, Mr. Lafortune was pronounced dead, leaving behind a wife and at least two children, the clerk said.<br />The hospital where Mr. Lafortune was taken couldn’t be determined. His family members and the judge couldn’t be reached to comment.<br />“Is it a coincidence that he is dead? Look at it: It is not a coincidence,” the legal clerk said. “It’s a clear signal that shows that a clerk cannot work on this case.”"
