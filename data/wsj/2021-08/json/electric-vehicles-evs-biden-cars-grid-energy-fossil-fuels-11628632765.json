    "body": "The federal government wants 40% to 50% of vehicles sold in the U.S. to be electric by 2030 (“The Electric Vehicle Welfare State,” Review & Outlook, Aug. 6). Does that mean I’ll have to endure full-time the brownouts and blackouts we now suffer only in the summertime? This is classic governing by emotion: We don’t have enough power to leave the lights and air conditioning on as it is, so let’s really overwhelm the grid, put little effort into upgrading it and creating significant clean power (read: nuclear) and subsidize giant auto makers to build what we’d never buy at the crazy prices they command.<br />Daniel W. Richards<br />Ontario, Calif.<br /><br />Here in the Pacific Northwest, we are blessed with a great deal of hydroelectric and wind power. It is not unreasonable to suggest all-electric vehicles are a good idea for our area. But in areas bereft of hydroelectric power or sufficient wind power, the electric vehicles must recharge from an electric grid that itself produces an enormous amount of pollution via coal and gas."
