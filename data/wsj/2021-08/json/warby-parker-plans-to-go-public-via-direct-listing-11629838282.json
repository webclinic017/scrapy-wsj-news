    "body": "Eyewear maker Warby Parker Inc. said Tuesday it plans to go public through a direct listing, making the company the latest to shirk the traditional public-offering process.<br />The direct-to-consumer company in June confidentiality filed a draft registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a public offering.<br />Direct listings differ from traditional initial public offerings in that companies take their shares to the stock market directly. Companies are able to save money that in a more traditional IPO would be shelled out to investment banks. This option to go public isnâ€™t as common as traditional IPOs.<br />Cryptocurrency exchange  Coinbase Global Inc . , data-mining company  Palantir Technologies Inc .  and streaming platform  Spotify Technology SA  went public through the direct-listing route.<br />For the six months ended June 30, Warby Parker had $270.5 million in revenue with losses of $20.4 million. The company generated revenue that totaled $393.7 million last year with a loss of $55.9 million. In 2019, it had $370.5 million in revenue and a loss of $57.5 million."
