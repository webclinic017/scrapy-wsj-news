    "body": "WASHINGTON—A divided Supreme Court on Thursday lifted part of New York’s eviction moratorium, saying the state had gone too far in protecting tenants at the expense of landlords.<br />The high court, in an unsigned written order, blocked a state measure that made it easy for tenants to invoke eviction protections by self-certifying that they were facing financial hardships during the Covid-19 pandemic. Landlords generally couldn’t challenge such certifications.<br />Before the justices’ intervention, the measure was to expire at the end of August.<br />The Supreme Court’s order said the New York approach, by denying landlords a hearing to contest the certifications, “violates the Court’s longstanding teaching that ordinarily no man can be a judge in his own case consistent with the Due Process Clause” of the Constitution.<br />The court said its order did nothing to disturb other New York provisions that allow tenants to invoke eviction protections in court proceedings, so long as they can demonstrate pandemic-related hardships."
