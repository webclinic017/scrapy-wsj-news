    "body": "WASHINGTON—U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials, under pressure to swiftly grant full approval to the  Pfizer  Covid-19 vaccine, are in an intense debate over whether the agency will make the decision this month or stretch the timetable into early or mid-September, according to people familiar with the discussions.<br />There has been a flurry of internal discussions about that timeline within the agency over the past two days, according to three people familiar with or involved in the talks.<br />Some agency and White House officials hope the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech, the only vaccine maker to submit all necessary paperwork, will get full, nonemergency use approval as soon as Aug. 15, according to two of the people. But the discussion in the past 24 hours has trended toward agreement that full approval for Pfizer’s vaccine isn’t likely until early or mid-September, two of the people said.<br />President Biden said last week that he expected a fully approved vaccine in early fall. Some Biden administration officials have pushed publicly for the FDA to move faster.<br />“I do hope it is going to be within the next couple of weeks,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CNN Tuesday. “They said hopefully by the end of the month. I hope it is even sooner than that.”"
