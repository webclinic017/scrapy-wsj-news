    "body": "Amazon.com Inc.  said it would delay corporate employees’ return to offices until next year as conditions around the Covid-19 pandemic evolve.<br />The company adds to the wave of businesses adjusting their return-to-work plans as the highly transmissible Delta variant of the virus drives a surge in coronavirus cases.<br />Amazon said Thursday that it was pushing its return to offices to at least Jan. 3, 2022. The online retail giant previously had targeted early September for regular office work to resume. The decision affects office workers both in the U.S. and other countries. The Seattle Times earlier reported on Amazon’s change in plans.<br />“We will continue to follow local government guidance and work closely with leading medical healthcare professionals, gathering their advice and recommendations as we go forward to ensure our work spaces are optimized for the safety of our teams,” Amazon said.<br />San Francisco-based  Wells Fargo  & Co. said Thursday that it was delaying its staggered office return to Oct. 4, citing rising Covid-19 cases across the U.S. The guidance doesn’t affect those employees already working in person and some others."
