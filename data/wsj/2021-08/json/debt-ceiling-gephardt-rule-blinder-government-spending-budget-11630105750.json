    "body": "The problem with Alan S. Blinder’s argument for the Gephardt Rule (“A Simple Rule Could End Debt-Ceiling Shenanigans,” op-ed, Aug. 24) is that the budget bills he would rely on are themselves packed with shenanigans. Falsified assumptions and accounting gimmicks are used to conceal the true costs.<br />Investors who buy U.S. debt are not interested in buying a bundle of fiscal fictions. They want a bond with an actual face value, backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. A periodic vote on the debt ceiling is a rare moment of truth, when members of Congress must confront the yawning gap between their promises and the reality of paying for them.<br />Mr. Blinder’s proposal might be more palatable if it were amended so that the cost estimates in the budget resolutions were binding—authorizing the Treasury to borrow no more than Congress said it would all cost, rather than borrow whatever it takes to fund the enacted programs. If that turned out not to suffice, Congress could always confess error and authorize more debt. But we are doomed if we permit Congress to “err” without ever confessing, and to spend without ever being held to account.<br />Brian Mannix<br />Gainesville, Va."
