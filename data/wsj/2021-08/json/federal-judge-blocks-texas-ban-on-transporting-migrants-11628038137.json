    "body": "A federal judge on Tuesday blocked an executive order by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott that banned the transportation of migrants within the state by anyone other than law enforcement, an initial legal victory for the Biden administration.<br />U.S. District Judge Kathleen Cardone in El Paso granted the Justice Department’s request for a temporary restraining order against the ban, saying the department was likely to prevail on arguments that the Texas ban unconstitutionally interfered with the federal government’s operations and conflicted with U.S. immigration law.<br />Judge Cardone, a George W. Bush appointee, also said the Texas ban was causing irreparable harm to the federal government “and to individuals the United States is charged with protecting, jeopardizing the health and safety of non-citizens in federal custody, risking the safety of federal law enforcement personnel and their families, and exacerbating the spread of COVID-19.”<br />The order will remain in place until Aug. 13, when the judge has scheduled a hearing on whether to issue a longer-term injunction against Texas.<br />The Justice Department declined to comment."
