    "body": "With home prices continuing to go up, this year’s housing boom left some hopeful buyers frustrated, discouraged and stuck with a big lump sum of cash.<br />Home buyers typically save between 5% and 20% for a down payment, with extra for closing costs. This year, many would-be buyers were met with bidding wars, stumped by historically low inventory or priced out of red-hot locations.<br />Now, they are sitting on thousands of dollars they had otherwise earmarked for a down payment on a house, and they are wondering where to stash the cash until the market cools off or their dream home becomes available.<br />This question is particularly tough because of the low rates on savings accounts, paired with inflation pressures. Yet with an expensive stock market and a continuing pandemic, many savers are also loath to invest their hard-earned down payment in the broad market. Cashing out investments can also come with tax consequences.<br />Here’s what to consider when parking a down payment for the season."
