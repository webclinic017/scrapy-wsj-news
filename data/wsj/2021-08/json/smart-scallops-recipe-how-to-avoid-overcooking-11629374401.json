    "body": "FEW SUMMER MEALS are as simple and elegant as a plate of seared scallops. At sister restaurants Street and Co., Fore Street and Scales in Portland, Maine, chef Frédéric Eliot enjoys a ready supply of the shellfish from local waters.<br />In his first Slow Food Fast recipe, the French-born chef shares a favorite from the Scales menu: seared scallops served with bacon, corn, roasted peppers and cream. “We use the bacon drippings to sear the scallops,” he said. “You want the pan to be hot before the scallops go in, and then lower the heat so they cook at a steady sizzle.” Searing on one side only guards against overcooking.<br />“This is one of our best sellers,” Mr. Eliot said. “Corn with bacon, peppers and scallops is a perfect match.”<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page.<br />—Kitty Greenwald is a chef, food writer and the co-author of ‘Slow Fires’ (Clarkson Potter)"
