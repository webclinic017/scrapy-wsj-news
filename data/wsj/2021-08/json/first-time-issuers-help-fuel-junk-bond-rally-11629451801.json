    "body": "Investors in search of better fixed-income returns are flocking to buy the lowest-rated junk debt from companies new to the high-yield market.<br />Debut sales of junk bonds from companies including Michaels Stores Inc. and  Square Inc.  are on pace to set a 16-year record, with over $68 billion of debt sold as of Aug. 17, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence’s LCD. The firm has been tracking the data since 2005.<br />John McClain, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, says that investors can find opportunities for excess returns in debut bond issues because they force the market to do its homework on a company’s potential earnings. His funds have added to holdings of bonds from first-time issuers this year.<br />“We’ve seen record issuance [in high yield], so a lot of companies can slip through the cracks,” he said. “We think that’s an inefficiency investors should be exploiting.”<br />It is shaping up to be a banner year for junk bonds overall. U.S. companies had sold over $316 billion of junk bonds through the end of July, around 32% ahead of last year’s record-breaking totals."
