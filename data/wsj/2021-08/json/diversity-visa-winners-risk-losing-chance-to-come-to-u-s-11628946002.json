    "body": "Tens of thousands of families around the world are at risk of losing a rare opportunity to immigrate to the United States.<br />For the past three decades, the Diversity Visa Program has awarded a path to legal permanent residence to about 55,000 people each year from countries with low levels of immigration to the U.S. Each applicant has a less than 1% chance of winning a green card.<br />The U.S. government must process the applications of lottery winners before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, or else the winners will lose their shot at a green card. As of June 2021, because of what the Biden administration says are Covid-19-related restraints, the State Department had only processed about 3% of the total 55,000 visa applications. Several ongoing federal lawsuits ask the State Department to reserve diversity visas to be processed after the coming deadline.<br />For now, Fatima Gibreel’s hope has an expiration date. She is a 29-year-old Sudanese farmworker who learned she won the visa lottery in May 2020.<br />“I saw I won…that was the first time my sisters and I had any hope. We didn’t have any for a very long time,” said Ms. Gibreel."
