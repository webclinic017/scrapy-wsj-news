    "body": "The company most often blamed for the opioid epidemic, OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP, sought refuge in bankruptcy from an onslaught of lawsuits that threatened to put the drugmaker out of business.<br />Now, after nearly two years in chapter 11, Purdue heads to trial in a New York bankruptcy court to seek approval of a multibillion-dollar proposal to settle the nationwide litigation that hinges on a  roughly $4.5 billion contribution from the company’s Sackler family owners. If successful, the bankruptcy plan will transform the drugmaker into a public benefit company dedicated to providing opioid addiction medicine and overdose treatments—with no involvement from the founding family.<br />Standing in Purdue’s way are a handful of state and federal authorities that oppose the Sackler deal and argue they can’t be forced into its terms. The Sacklers have been named as defendants in litigation alleging they share liability for fueling opioid addiction, which they deny. Purdue is among the drug manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies facing litigation over opioids, some of which separately agreed last month to a historic $26 billion settlement to address the epidemic.<br />The bankruptcy trial, scheduled to begin Thursday, won’t weigh Purdue’s or the Sacklers’ potential culpability in the opioid crisis. Instead, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain is expected to consider the settlement’s value and whether its economics offer a fair resolution to the chapter 11 case.<br />The bankruptcy court will consider the application of a legal tool known as a nonconsensual third-party release, which would extinguish claims against the Sacklers even by creditors that object. If approved, the settlement would begin funding abatement programs later this year, court papers show."
