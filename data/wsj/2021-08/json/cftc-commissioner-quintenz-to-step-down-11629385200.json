    "body": "WASHINGTON—Democrats are set to gain control over the nation’s derivatives-market regulator after one of the two Republicans on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission departs at the end of this month.<br />CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz, who was nominated in 2017 by then-President Donald Trump at the recommendation of Sen. Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), said in an interview he plans to leave the agency Aug. 31. Though his five-year term expired in April 2020, he is legally eligible to remain at the regulator until the end of this year.<br />The departure will leave the CFTC’s five-member panel—which already had one vacancy following the exit of former Chairman Heath Tarbert in January—with two empty seats. It also could allow acting Chairman Rostin Behnam more leeway over policy by giving Democrats a majority on the commission.<br />Bloomberg reported last week that President Biden plans to nominate Mr. Behnam to lead the CFTC on a permanent basis. The White House declined to comment on the report and said it had no updates on whom Mr. Biden plans to nominate to fill the existing vacancy at the CFTC.<br />The agency, which oversees the markets for hundreds of trillions of dollars of derivatives, has focused mainly on enforcement since Mr. Biden took office. Among its few policy-related actions was Mr. Behnam’s creation in March of a unit to focus on “the role of derivatives in understanding, pricing and addressing climate-related risk and transitioning to a low-carbon economy.”"
