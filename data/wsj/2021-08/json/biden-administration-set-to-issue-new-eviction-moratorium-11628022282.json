    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration was expected to announce a new federal moratorium on evictions, according to people familiar with the matter, following pressure from progressive Democrats who had pressed for a revival of lapsed tenant protections despite White House officials saying they lacked the legal authority to do so.<br />The action, which is expected to target areas of the country with high levels of Covid-19 infection, could buy states and localities more time to distribute about $47 billion in rental assistance designed to help tenants harmed by the pandemic who have fallen behind on their rent. As of June 30, just $3 billion of that money had reached tenants and landlords.<br />The White House had said for days that lawmakers would need to pass legislation to extend the moratorium after a recent Supreme Court decision prevented the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from once again extending its moratorium absent congressional authorization. But the White House waited until last Thursday to ask Congress to try to pass an extension. The CDC had previously extended the moratorium three times before it expired on Saturday.<br />The details of the revived moratorium were still in flux, the people said. The CDC didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.<br />President Biden is expected to address the subject later Tuesday. The moratorium, which stems from an August 2020 executive order by then-President Donald Trump, has protected millions of tenants from eviction but created financial hardships for landlords."
