    "body": "HSBC Holdings PLC’s net profit rose in the second quarter as the London-based lender reduced provisions for bad loans caused by the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.<br />The banking giant, which is sharpening its focus on lucrative Asian markets, unveiled a forecast-beating quarterly profit of $3.4 billion and said it would resume paying dividends—a key focus for many investors in the sector.<br />But at the same time, it kept hold of a large buffer against credit losses stemming from the pandemic, and warned of continued uncertainty caused by Covid-19.<br />“We are seeing some early signs of the investments that we are making in Asia delivering,” Chief Executive Noel Quinn said in an interview.<br />The world economy likely returned to its pre-pandemic size in the spring, according to economists, marking a comeback from the deepest global downturn in decades. Mortgage lending was strong during the first half of the year in Hong Kong and the U.K., HSBC said."
