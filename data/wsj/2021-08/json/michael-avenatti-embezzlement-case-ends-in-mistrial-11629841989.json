    "body": "A judge declared a mistrial in the trial of Michael Avenatti on charges that he stole millions of dollars in client funds.<br />U.S. District Judge James V. Selna ruled in his Santa Ana, Calif. courtroom on Tuesday that prosecutors failed to turn over financial evidence, in violation of their discovery obligations.<br />The evidence involved financial data from a software used by Mr. Avenatti’s firm. Prosecutors first turned it over to him on Monday, a month into the trial, according to Mr. Avenatti, who pleaded not guilty on ten charges of wire fraud and was representing himself.<br />“The government was on notice of the importance of this information early on in its investigation and yet did nothing to locate it and produce it,” he said in court filings.<br />A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office confirmed the mistrial and declined to answer further questions, including whether prosecutors would seek to retry him."
