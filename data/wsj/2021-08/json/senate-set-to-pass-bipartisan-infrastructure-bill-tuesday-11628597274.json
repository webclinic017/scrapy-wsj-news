    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Senate was set to pass a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure package with broad bipartisan support Tuesday, advancing a central piece of President Biden’s economic agenda that would amount to one of the most substantial federal investments in roads, bridges and rail in decades.<br />The product of weeks of painstaking negotiations between a bipartisan group of 10 senators and the White House, the legislation would both reauthorize spending on existing federal public-works programs and pour an additional $550 billion into water projects, the electrical grid and safety efforts, among many other projects.<br />While lawmakers and presidents of both parties have said for years that they wanted to come together on a major package on infrastructure, an agreement consistently eluded them.<br />With expected passage in the Senate on Tuesday, Mr. Biden is poised to buck that trend, though the bill still faces a potentially rocky path in the House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) has said the chamber won’t take it up until the Senate also passes a separate $3.5 trillion antipoverty and climate plan, a challenging negotiation of its own that could take months.<br />Many senators cheered the legislation as a boon to the economy and as evidence that Republicans and Democrats can still work together on major legislation in Washington."
