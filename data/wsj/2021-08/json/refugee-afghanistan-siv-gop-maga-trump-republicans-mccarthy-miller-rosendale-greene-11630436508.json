Our treatment of the Afghans who worked with us over the past two decades will determine the answer.<br />From a standing start two weeks ago, the American military managed to evacuate all but a few hundred of the U.S. citizens who wanted to leave, according to White House estimates, along with more than 100,000 Afghans.
