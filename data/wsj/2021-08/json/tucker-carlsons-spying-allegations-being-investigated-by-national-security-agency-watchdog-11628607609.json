    "body": "WASHINGTON—The National Security Agency’s internal watchdog is conducting a review of recent allegations made by Fox News host Tucker Carlson that the spy agency had improperly targeted his communications for surveillance, the agency and an official said.<br />The announcement of the review by the NSA’s inspector general doesn’t mention Mr. Carlson by name, but instead refers to a member of the U.S. news media. A person familiar with the matter said the review concerns Mr. Carlson.<br />The review will examine NSA’s compliance with laws and policies governing intelligence collection, analysis and dissemination, including procedures surrounding the unmasking of the redacted identities of U.S. citizens or residents caught up in surveillance of foreign nationals, NSA Inspector General Robert Storch said.<br />An NSA spokesman said the agency “remains fully committed to the rigorous and independent oversight provided by the NSA Inspector General’s office” and added that the watchdog played a “critical role” overseeing its activities and ensuring accountability.<br />“We are gratified to learn the NSA’s egregious surveillance of Tucker Carlson will now be independently investigated,” a Fox News spokeswoman said."
