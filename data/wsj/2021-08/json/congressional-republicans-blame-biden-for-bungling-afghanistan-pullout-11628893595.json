    "body": "WASHINGTON—As the situation in Afghanistan deteriorates rapidly, the response on Capitol Hill has fallen largely along partisan lines, with many Republicans criticizing the Biden administration’s handling of the U.S. pullout but unable to intervene legislatively. Democrats, meanwhile, have largely avoided casting blame at the White House after supporting the idea of the withdrawal.<br />Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who has warned that Afghanistan could be “an even worse sequel” to the 1975 fall of Saigon, said he had an “urgent conversation” Friday with Afghanistan’s ambassador to the U.S., Adela Raz.<br />“This debacle was not only foreseeable, it was foreseen,” Mr. McConnell said in a statement. “The President and his team actively decided against a far more responsible approach to preserving our national security interests and protecting our Afghan partners.”<br />He said it isn’t too late to prevent the Taliban from overrunning Kabul. “The Administration should move quickly to hammer Taliban advances with air strikes, provide critical support to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) defending the capital, and prevent the seemingly imminent fall of the city,” Mr. McConnell said.<br />“If they fail to do so, the security threat to the United States will assuredly grow and the humanitarian cost to innocent Afghans will be catastrophic,” he added."
