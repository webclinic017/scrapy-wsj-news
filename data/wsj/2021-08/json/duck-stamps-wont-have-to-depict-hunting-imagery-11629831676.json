    "body": "WASHINGTON—Federal Duck Stamps will no longer be required to show hunting imagery, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said Tuesday as it reversed a Trump administration decree.<br />Fish and Wildlife oversees an annual competition for the stamp’s artwork, and participation in the contest fell 27% in 2020, the year after the hunting mandate took effect, the agency said.<br />The change will give “artists more flexibility when designing their art,” Fish and Wildlife said in a statement.<br />The stamps, which cost $25, must be purchased by waterfowl hunters over the age of 16 but are also widely collected by birders, wildlife photographers and conservationists. Sales support conservation.<br />The requirement for hunting imagery, such as firearms and decoys, grew out of an initiative by former Trump administration Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to promote hunting."
