    "body": "A Florida judge said school districts could impose mask mandates and that Gov. Ron DeSantis had overstepped his authority when he banned such rules.<br />Judge John Cooper of the Second Judicial District in Tallahassee sided with parents of school children who had challenged a July executive order by Mr. DeSantis and a subsequent state rule that forbid school districts from implementing mask requirements that don’t allow parents to opt out their children.<br />In an oral ruling Friday, Judge Cooper said the defendants, including the governor and the state Department of Education, improperly sought to draw authority for their actions from a state law enacted earlier this year, dubbed the parents’ bill of rights, which aimed to protect parents’ ability to make decisions regarding their children’s education and health.<br />“The defendants do not have authority under this law to a blanket mandatory ban against a face mask policy that does not provide a parental opt out,” Judge Cooper said. “They simply do not.”<br />Under that law, school districts can enact policies such as mask mandates without seeking permission in advance from the state, as long as they are reasonable and serve a compelling state interest, the judge said."
