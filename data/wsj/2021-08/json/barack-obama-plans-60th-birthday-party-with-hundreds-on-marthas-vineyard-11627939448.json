    "body": "Former President Barack Obama is planning a 60th birthday party with hundreds of guests at his Martha’s Vineyard vacation home this weekend, as the nation brings back some Covid-19 precautions to combat a rising tide of Delta-variant cases.<br />Mr. Obama’s gathering will take place outdoors and will follow all local, state and federal health protocols, including a testing regime managed by a public-health professional, according to a person familiar with the plan.<br />The party, earlier reported by The Hill, has triggered some online criticism among conservatives and charges of hypocrisy, reflecting the nation’s political polarization over the pandemic and the debate over the proper measures to address Covid-19.<br />Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, a senior Republican in the House, suggested in a tweet Monday that Democrats would treat such an event as dangerous if it were held by former President Donald Trump.<br />Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, stressed that the event would be outdoors, when asked Monday about the medical considerations and whether average Americans should hold such large parties."
