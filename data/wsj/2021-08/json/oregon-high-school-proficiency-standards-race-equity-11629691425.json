    "body": "Oregon’s desire to have minority students achieve academic parity by eliminating proficiency requirements (“Dumbing Oregon Down,” Review & Outlook, Aug. 13) reminds me of a story from one of my economic professors: “An economist entered a room and remarked how cold the room was. He went to a wall thermometer and confirmed that the room was 45 degrees and, yes, quite cool. He then struck a match and placed the flame under the thermometer until it read 75 degrees. “Aaaah, that’s much better,” he said. Some things never change.<br />Cortes E. DeRussy<br />Bronxville, N.Y.<br /><br />As Oregon high-school graduates head off to college, many will discover that they are unprepared for the demands of higher education, despite diplomas telling them otherwise. At worst, they’ll be forced to drop out after accruing thousands of dollars of debt. At best, they’ll have to pay tuition to acquire high-school level knowledge. What’s the point of free public education if students still have to pay to learn essential skills?"
