    "body": "Elon Musk is expected to spotlight  Tesla Inc.’s  work on artificial intelligence as the company faces increased federal scrutiny of a key application of that technology: its driver-assistance system known as Autopilot.<br />Tesla on Thursday evening is slated to host what Mr. Musk has billed as a recruiting event about artificial intelligence, or technology designed to mimic the way humans think.<br />Mr. Musk often uses such settings to drum up interest in Tesla products, though his bold predictions haven’t always come to pass. Two years ago at an event about automation, he projected that more than a million Tesla vehicles would be able to operate without a driver by the middle of 2020, positioning the company to launch a robot taxi service.<br />That hasn’t happened, though the company has made progress with some of its software.<br />“Generalized self-driving is a hard problem, as it requires solving a large part of real-world AI. Didn’t expect it to be so hard, but the difficulty is obvious in retrospect,” Mr. Musk said on Twitter last month."
