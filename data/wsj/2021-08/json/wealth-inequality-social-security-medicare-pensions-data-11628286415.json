    "body": "The study cited in your editorial demonstrates that the inclusion of Social Security and defined-benefit pensions reduces wealth inequality significantly (“A Distorted View of Wealth Inequality,” Review & Outlook, July 31). It should have gone further by including Medicare, which is conceptually similar: You pay into the system now with the expectation of receiving benefits later. Although Medicare’s present value for an individual is difficult to calculate, its inclusion would reduce inequality even further.<br />Ed Davis<br />Brooklyn, N.Y.<br /><br />There are real-world implications to ignoring Social Security and defined-benefit pensions. Colleges typically ignore both in determining financial-aid offers. Families reliant on a 401(k) or IRA for retirement are penalized for savings; annual contributions to a retirement account are treated as available for tuition because they are supposedly discretionary expenditures."
