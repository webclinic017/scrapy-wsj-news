    "body": "Joseph Gordon-Levitt talks about his inspiration for the new series he created, “Mr. Corman,” about a depressed Millennial. Susan Sarandon talks about life lists and bucking up her sad son in “Ride the Eagle.” And a teen summer-romance musical featuring actors with disabilities, for those who simply “want to feel joy and be entertained.”<br />Here’s where to stream them all:<br />(Apple TV+)<br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt was born to a pair of loving and supportive parents, had an enviable acting career before he was out of elementary school and made successful transitions to both teen and adult actor. Back in 2015, the year he became a dad, he started counting his blessings and writing down what his life would have looked like if it had all gone differently.<br />The result is “Mr. Corman,” the story of Josh Corman, a sad, single 30-something who had a rough childhood, whose rock ’n’ roll dreams are unfulfilled, who lives paycheck to paycheck, and still brings his anxieties to his mother (Debra Winger). Mr. Gordon-Levitt, who created the series and plays the title character, says that when he imagined what his life could’ve been, it wasn’t all negative. He made the character a fifth-grade teacher, for example, because he says if acting hadn’t worked out, being a teacher wouldn’t have been a concession, but a privilege."
