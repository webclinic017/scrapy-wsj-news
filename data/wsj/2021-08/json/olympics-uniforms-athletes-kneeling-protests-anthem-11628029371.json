    "body": "Regarding the letters from readers on protests by Olympic athletes (July 26 and 31): I have yet to read the main reason why these protests are inappropriate. It is found in one word: uniform. All these protests are made by people in uniforms.<br />When one wears the uniform of an organization, whether it be the U.S. military, a police department or an athletic squad, one acts as a representative of a team. As such, the team comes before the members’ desires relative to anything controversial. All team members wear standard attire and are expected to perform in a uniform manner—by the rules of behavior established by team leaders. The military and police have rules of engagement. Athletic teams must follow the rules of the game.<br />Team members should be expected to behave in a manner that does not bring shame or embarrassment to the team as an organization or to fellow members. The bottom line: Professional sports-team owners, and, in this latest case, the leadership of the U.S. Olympic team, have failed in their leadership duties by condoning disrespectful behavior.<br />Col. Ken Faulhaber, USAF (Ret.)<br />Ocala, Fla."
