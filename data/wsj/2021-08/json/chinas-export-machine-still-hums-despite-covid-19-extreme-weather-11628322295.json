    "body": "BEIJING—Chinese export and import growth slowed in July as flooding and extreme weather at home disrupted factory and port operations and constrained consumption, while the fast-spreading Delta variant of the coronavirus loomed on the horizon.<br />Despite the challenges, China’s export sector showed continued resilience, increasing 19.3% in dollar terms in July compared with a year earlier, data from the General Administration of Customs showed Saturday.<br />That marked a retreat from June’s 32.2% year-over-year gain, but was largely in line with the 20% growth forecast by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. To some degree, the slower year-over-year percentage advance reflects a tapering off of flattering comparisons to the pandemic-hit economic figures early last year.<br />Slowing growth in exports, a key pillar of China’s post-Covid-19 recovery, hasn’t been unexpected. If anything, predictions of an end to the sustained exports boom that began in the spring of 2020—when the world’s second-largest economy cranked out medical equipment and work-from-home computer equipment for the rest of the world—have been constant for months.<br />But China’s export machine has continued to hum in defiance of those predictions, notching up month after month of yearly double-digit percentage growth figures."
