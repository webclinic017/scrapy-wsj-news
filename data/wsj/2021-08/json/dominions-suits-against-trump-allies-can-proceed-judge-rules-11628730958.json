    "body": "WASHINGTON—A federal judge ruled that Dominion Voting Systems Corp. can proceed with three lawsuits alleging that lawyers and supporters of former President Donald Trump defamed the company with false accusations that it rigged the 2020 election.<br />U.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols on Wednesday denied motions by Rudy Giuliani, pro-Trump attorney Sidney Powell and MyPillow Inc. and Chief Executive Mike Lindell to dismiss the lawsuits, rejecting their arguments.<br />The ruling by Judge Nichols, a Trump appointee, represents an early win for Dominion, one of the largest voting machine companies in the U.S., and exemplifies the legal fallout from the 2020 election. Allies of Mr. Trump have lost dozens of court cases in which they claimed widespread election fraud or wrongdoing. Federal and state officials have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud that could have changed the outcome of the presidential election.<br />A Dominion spokeswoman said the company was pleased to see the legal process moving forward.<br />Howard Kleinhendler, Ms. Powell’s attorney, said, “We now look forward to litigating this case on its merits and proving that Ms. Powell’s statements were accurate and certainly not published with malice.” He said that they will push to investigate Dominion as part of the legal discovery process."
