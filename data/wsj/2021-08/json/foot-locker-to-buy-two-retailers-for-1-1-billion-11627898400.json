    "body": "Foot Locker Inc. is buying two smaller retailers for a total of approximately $1.1 billion in separate cash deals, as the company looks to expand its reach beyond U.S. shopping malls, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The New York-based company is expected to announce the acquisitions of athletic retailer WSS for $750 million and Atmos, a Japan-based streetwear and sneaker shop, for $360 million as soon as Monday, they said.<br />The acquisition of Los Angeles-based WSS, which generated $425 million in revenue in 2020, gives Foot Locker access to a large Latino customer base, an important and fast-growing demographic, one of the people said.<br />WSS has 93 stores across the West Coast and Southwest U.S., mainly located in working-class, urban neighborhoods instead of the malls where Foot Locker stores are most frequently found.<br />Foot Locker previously announced plans to move more of its roughly 3,000 stores outside of enclosed malls, a strategy that the coronavirus pandemic had accelerated, Chief Executive Richard Johnson said in an earnings call last year."
