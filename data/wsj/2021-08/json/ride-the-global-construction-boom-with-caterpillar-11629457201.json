You’re invited to play along with us here.<br />Despite being a major beneficiary of several emerging global trends,  Caterpillar  isn’t a very well loved stock on Wall Street at the moment. That makes for an opportunity.<br />A few days of trading action over the summer capture the debate over the maker of excavators, construction and mining equipment and other heavy machinery. The stock fell 3.5% over two days after the company reported solid earrings on July 30 but also warned of sequentially lower margins in the third quarter. It then rallied 6.1% in early August as the Senate passed a bipartisan infrastructure bill with $550 billion of new spending over 10 years.<br />“Caterpillar is experiencing a cyclical recovery and that’s a positive, but there are a number of factors that are complicating that recovery,” says UBS analyst Steven Fisher. “It’s somewhat different from a typical cycle.”<br />These near-term issues include supply-chain constraints and raw-materials shortages of the kind faced by many manufacturers. But the bigger picture is that much of the developed world appears poised to embark on a multiyear construction binge, led by both the public and private sectors. In Europe and the U.S., the baton of policy leadership has been passed from monetary to fiscal policy."
