    "body": "ALBANY, N.Y.—Officials in the New York state Assembly said their impeachment investigation of Gov. Andrew Cuomo is nearing completion and set an Aug. 13 deadline for him to submit evidence in his defense.<br />Lawyers working for the Democrat-dominated chamber said Thursday they advised Mr. Cuomo’s counsel that “the Assembly will soon consider potential articles of impeachment against your client,” according to Assembly Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Lavine, who is overseeing the impeachment process.<br />The impeachment inquiry began in March after Mr. Cuomo was accused of sexually harassing multiple women on his staff and federal prosecutors in Brooklyn opened an investigation into state policies regarding Covid-19 in nursing homes.<br />Mr. Cuomo has repeatedly denied inappropriately touching anybody and said he is cooperating with the federal investigation. He has said the state’s nursing-home policies were crafted to preserve hospital capacity during the height of the coronavirus pandemic and were in line with federal recommendations at the time.<br />A spokesman for the Democratic governor didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about the Assembly’s deadline."
