    "body": "Large property owners are looking to unload more malls through sales or by allowing lenders to take over, brushing aside a recovery in the shopping-center business as more Americans get vaccinated.<br />Global mall operator  Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield ,  for one, sold three U.S. malls last year. The Paris-based company intends to further shrink its current 25-property portfolio in the U.S. to lower its debt levels, executives said during an earnings call last week.<br />One of Europe’s largest commercial real-state firms, Unibail-Rodamco purchased Westfield Group in 2018 for nearly $16 billion. The mall operator acquired 33 U.S. properties, including high-profile malls such as the Westfield World Trade Center in Manhattan and Westfield Garden State Plaza in nearby Bergen County, N.J.<br />The company’s recent retreat in the U.S. shows how the pandemic is further dividing the retail real-estate world.<br />Owners of top-tier Class A malls are doing all right and collecting top-of-the-market rents. These more modern, higher quality properties feature fine-dining restaurants and luxury-goods shops. They are usually located in affluent neighborhoods, where residents have ridden out the pandemic with their jobs intact and are eagerly spending again."
