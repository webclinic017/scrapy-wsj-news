    "body": "Graphics-chip maker  Nvidia Corp.  benefited from continued hot demand for devices from computer videogamers and cryptocurrency miners, pushing its sales and profit to records in its most recent quarter.<br />Nvidia has been one of the tech companies that profited most handsomely from the pandemic-era economy, when millions of people turned to videogames, online services and other home-based activities during lockdowns.<br />Sales rose by 68% to $6.51 billion in the period ended in July, the company said. Net profit nearly quadrupled, reaching $2.37 billion.<br />The company’s latest generation of graphics cards are popular with computer gamers for whom high-quality images and fast frame-rates are prized. Its high-end cards have sold out fast, and resellers have responded to demand by buying available stocks and marking them up well above their list price.<br />The cards are also well-suited to the computing-power demands of cryptocurrency mining. To avoid that demand crimping the supply of components for gamers, Nvidia sells products specifically for the digital-currency creation market. It also has put in place software designed to limit the usefulness of its gaming cards for crypto-mining. Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said more than 80% of the company’s latest graphics cards had those limiters on them, adding that crypto-specific chips would be a minimal contributor to future revenue."
