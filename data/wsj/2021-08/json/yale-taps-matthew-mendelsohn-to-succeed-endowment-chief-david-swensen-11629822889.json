    "body": "Yale University named internal endowment veteran Matthew Mendelsohn as the next head of its more than $31 billion endowment, capping a search for the successor to famed endowment manager David Swensen.<br />The 36-year-old Mr. Mendelsohn was a protégé of Mr. Swensen’s who joined the Yale Investments Office in 2007 and went on to run its venture capital investments. Yale’s venture footprint makes up more than a quarter of its endowment’s portfolio and has been an important contributor to the endowment’s returns in recent years.<br />Former Yale provost and search committee chair Ben Polak said in a statement Tuesday, “The committee left no stone unturned in the search. In the end, the right answer was immediately before us. Matt Mendelsohn has the respect of his colleagues, of managers, and of his peer CIOs—and an extraordinary record of investing, building and leading teams, and representing what is best about Yale.”<br />Several in the endowment investing world said Mr. Mendelsohn’s selection would provide continuity at Yale’s endowment. They also said it served as an acknowledgment of the continuing importance of venture and growth investments to Yale’s portfolio.<br />Former endowment chief Mr. Swensen died in May after having been diagnosed with cancer nine years earlier."
