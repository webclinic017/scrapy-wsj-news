    "body": "THIS MONTH I finally got to realize a lifelong dream: to spend some quality time in my friend Joan’s exquisite bathroom.<br />Joan’s bathroom was not one of those modern, faux-California spas with a Japanese soaking tub, an infinity-edge sink and a toilet so smart it could do the crossword puzzle for you.<br />Instead, the bathroom in her prewar apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan had an old-fashioned pedestal sink, black-and-white floor tile and a white marble bathtub—circa 1912—in which you could comfortably execute a dead man’s float.<br />In other words, Joan’s lavatory was a museum-quality example of why you should do your best to preserve original, classic décor. Or it was, until my husband emerged from this historical sanctuary one afternoon clutching the remnants of a polished-nickel toilet paper holder.<br />“It just fell off the wall,” he said, stricken. He cradled the broken, swing-arm paper holder as if it were a dead sparrow. “It wasn’t my fault.”"
