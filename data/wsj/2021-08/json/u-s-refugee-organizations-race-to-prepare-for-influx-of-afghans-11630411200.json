    "body": "WASHINGTON—Refugee resettlement organizations across the U.S. are gearing up to resettle tens of thousands of newly arriving Afghans, many of whom are arriving with uncertain immigration statuses and little other than the clothing on their backs.<br />The nine nonprofit organizations that are contracted with the U.S. State Department to help refugees find homes, jobs and other social services are now racing to hire enough staff, sign up volunteers and raise sufficient money to properly resettle the Afghans.<br />Some leaders of those organizations say the government hasn’t provided precise figures on how many Afghans the organizations should be expecting to take on—or how quickly those people will arrive. The Department of Homeland Security, the lead agency coordinating the resettlement effort, didn’t respond to a request for comment.<br />Resettlement-agency leaders held a call Sunday with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, in which he pledged his cooperation but mostly listened to the issues raised, according to two people on the call.<br />The groups also don’t know which of the arriving Afghans will come with approved Special Immigrant Visas, which entitle them to a panoply of services, including months of healthcare and food assistance. The visa program was designed for Afghans who worked alongside the American military during the two-decade war."
