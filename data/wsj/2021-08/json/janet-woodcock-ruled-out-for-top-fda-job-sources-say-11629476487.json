    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration has decided it won’t nominate acting Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Janet Woodcock to lead the agency on a permanent basis, according to people familiar with the situation, who say the White House is now focused on a shortlist of other potential candidates.<br />Dr. Woodcock was once considered a possible nominee for the permanent job despite opposition from Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) and other senators who sent a letter to the White House in March calling for new leadership at the FDA, citing its “long track record approving dangerous opioids without considering public health.”<br />More recently, the White House was dissatisfied over how the FDA under Dr. Woodcock handled the controversial approval of an Alzheimer’s drug over objections of some staff members and members of an advisory committee.<br />Dr. Woodcock declined to comment on the letter from Mr. Manchin and other senators and didn’t respond to a request for comment for this article. Bloomberg News earlier reported that the White House had decided she would not be nominated for the top FDA job.<br />A White House spokesman said no one has been ruled out for the FDA post at this time. Dr. Woodcock has been acting FDA commissioner since President Biden took office Jan. 20."
