    "body": "<br /><br /><br />B.B. King and Duke Ellington reportedly called him their favorite guitar player. Though not a household name, Kenny Burrell—who turned 90 on July 31—is one of the most respected and plentifully recorded American guitarists. He has made more than 100 jazz albums as leader, performed as a sideman on thousands of recordings, and served as an inspiring college educator and Ellington advocate.<br />Mr. Burrell grew up in a musical family in Detroit, a vital incubator of such future jazz notables as vibraphonist Milt Jackson, bassist Paul Chambers, and the Jones brothers—trumpeter Thad, pianist Hank and drummer Elvin."
