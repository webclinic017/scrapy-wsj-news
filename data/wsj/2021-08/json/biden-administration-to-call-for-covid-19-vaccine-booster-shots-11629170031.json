    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is expected to announce that Americans who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 should receive a booster shot to ensure continued protection, according to people familiar with the discussions.<br />The booster shot would be administered eight months after the second dose of the vaccine was received, the people said.<br />Senior Biden administration health and medical officials have been discussing the possibility of calling for booster shots for weeks and are nearing agreement on the issue, said the people, who added that a final decision hasn’t been made. A formal announcement could come as soon as later this week.<br />The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that the Biden administration was preparing a booster-shot strategy, and that the shots could be needed as soon as in the next few weeks for people who were first to be vaccinated.<br />Pfizer Inc.  and partner  BioNTech SE ,  the companies behind a two-dose Covid-19 vaccine, are seeking clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to provide booster shots to the general public. If the FDA greenlights the shots, the first doses could be distributed in September, the people said, as the first Americans who were vaccinated reach the eight-month window."
