    "body": "The corporate crackdown in China that has hammered internet stocks is driving investors to sectors still in Beijing’s good graces, such as high-tech manufacturing and renewable energy.<br />Shares of Chinese semiconductor companies, electric-vehicle manufacturers and solar-panel makers listed in mainland China climbed over the past month while shares of technology giants and companies that provide after-school tutoring suffered massive selloffs.<br />The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets haven’t been immune to the effects of Beijing’s regulatory clampdown on private-sector companies, but they have performed significantly better than Chinese stocks listed on exchanges in the U.S. and Hong Kong.<br />An MSCI index that tracks onshore China A-shares has fallen 3.2% since the start of July, compared with a 12% decline for the broader MSCI China index, heavily influenced by  Tencent Holdings Ltd. ,  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. ,  Meituan  and other offshore-listed Internet-technology companies.<br />The outperformers over that period have been domestic Chinese indexes for new-energy stocks, semiconductor makers and electric-vehicle companies, up 4% to 18% since the beginning of July—adding to gains in recent months."
