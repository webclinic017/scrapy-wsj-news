    "body": "If you could raise your infant’s IQ by four points, would you? Many parents would, and it’s now technologically feasible. Geneticists can screen embryos for traits ranging from height to facial features to intelligence. The method builds upon the procedure of in vitro fertilization, which induces the release of several eggs by hormonal treatment and fertilizes them in a lab. Genetic testing of the resulting embryos can produce predictions of the traits that the offspring are likely to exhibit, even if those traits are “polygenic” (influenced by thousands of genes with tiny effects). The parents then choose an embryo to implant in the mother. IVF is common, accounting for 10% of births in some countries.<br />All this creates unprecedented ethical challenges in the immediate future. Consider the parents who use IVF to raise their children’s IQ. If the children repeat the process for another generation, taking advantage of scientific advances during the interim, they could bring the total average gain in the grandchildren north of 10 points—a huge gain. That advantage could be big enough to give the grandchildren radically disproportionate representation at the highest levels of science, finance, information technology, medicine, law and business.<br />Imagine the behavior of any couple who plan to have a few children and can easily afford the cost of IVF—roughly $11,000 to $12,000. Virtually all upper-middle-class American couples will have it within their power to give their child a wide variety of advantages. How many parents would nonetheless choose to bring a child into the world the old-fashioned way—especially in a world where the increased use of IVF has led to improvements that increase its convenience and lower its costs? IVF could become the norm for the upper middle class. Congress could pass legislation that subsidizes IVF among lower-income populations, but only a highly intrusive policy is likely to stop the magnification of inequality.<br />Many think genetic enhancement will be a wonderful thing. In some ways, it might be. But if the old-fashioned way of making babies becomes a thing of the past, we may come to miss it for more than sentimental reasons. Natural selection has a way of eliminating traits that aren’t necessary for survival or reproduction. Studies of cave-dwelling animals that have become blind suggest that the responsible mutations were strongly favored by selection. Whether such a process would knock out sexuality in humans over centuries or millennia is hard to say, and there is also the wild card of what a much more technologically advanced society might be able or willing to do. But unless ethical concerns or further biological tinkering turns us back, we will have set ourselves on a trajectory—perhaps slow, perhaps not so slow—of losing an aspect of our nature even more fundamental than our intellect.<br />There are further prospects for reproductive technology that pose an even more immediate threat to sexuality. These include the production of both sperm and eggs from the mature cells of a person of either sex. If thousands of viable eggs can be harvested in a single batch, then the expected gain from polygenic screening will be more than doubled. The clear and present danger to sexuality, however, comes from the elimination of the biological requirement of having a father and mother. Same-sex couples could have biological children. Once the necessity and desirability of natural conception have been undone, the immemorial bond that has made the sexes one flesh could be dissolved, leaving behind two alienated “species” with little in common."
