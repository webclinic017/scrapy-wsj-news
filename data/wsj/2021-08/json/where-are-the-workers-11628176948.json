    "body": "Unfilled job openings hit another record high at U.S. small firms in July, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. Proving once again that markets work, the percentage of company owners planning to raise compensation also set a new record in the latest NFIB survey due out later today.<br />NFIB Chief Economist William Dunkelberg reports:<br />Operating almost like a law of physics, a labor shortage naturally and reliably motivates employers to increase the incentive for employees and potential employees to show up for work. Mr. Dunkelberg reports:<br />True enough, and of course there is a lot that politicians can do to reduce the incentives they have created for people to remain outside the labor force. Around half of U.S. states have already ended the extra Covid-related unemployment benefits that will expire everywhere in September. Mr. Dunkelberg expects robust hiring in the days ahead as labor force participation increases:<br />In the meantime, the good news is that productivity has increased as  the U.S. is now exceeding pre-Covid levels of goods and services with fewer workers. Imagine what we can achieve with a larger workforce."
