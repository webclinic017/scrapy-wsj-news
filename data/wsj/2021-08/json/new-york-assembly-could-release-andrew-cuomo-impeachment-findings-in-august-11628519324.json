    "body": "ALBANY, N.Y.—The New York state Assembly will hold public and private hearings this month as part of its impeachment investigation into Gov. Andrew Cuomo, attempting to conclude its work “with all due haste,” key lawmakers said Monday.<br />Assemblyman Charles Lavine, a Long Island Democrat, said the chamber’s judiciary committee was still investigating the Democratic governor’s conduct and weighing potential articles of impeachment.<br />The committee opened its investigation in March after multiple women accused the governor of sexual harassment.<br />Mr. Lavine said the committee had received evidence from a report released last Tuesday by state Attorney General Letitia James. It concluded that Mr. Cuomo broke state and federal sexual-harassment laws when he inappropriately hugged, kissed, touched and commented about the women.<br />The governor has denied inappropriately touching anybody and said Ms. James’s review was biased. Mr. Cuomo hasn’t appeared in public since the report was issued, and his senior adviser, Rich Azzopardi, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the Assembly’s announcement."
