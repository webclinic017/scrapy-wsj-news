    "body": "It’s been five weeks since thousands across Cuba joined unprecedented protests against the 62-year-old communist regime. Yet Team Biden is still having trouble delineating a policy that actively supports the popular cry for self-governance. It’s enough to make one wonder if regime change is an administration priority.<br />In the days and weeks to come, White House positions regarding remittances to the island and the use of the Magnitsky Act to impose sanctions at the very top of the regime could go a long way in resolving those doubts.<br />Divergent objectives inside the Democratic Party are slowing things down. Moderates, Hispanics in Florida and New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez want the administration to side with the Cuban people.<br />But Mr. Biden’s progressive flank remains faithful to its beloved “revolution.” Some, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, continue to spout Havana’s totalitarian talking points. “The embargo is absurdly cruel,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in a July 15 statement, “and, like too many other U.S. policies targeting Latin Americans, the cruelty is the point.”<br />This is nonsense. The regime can buy all the food and medicine it wants from the U.S. and can freely trade with the rest of the world. Havana’s ruling mafia doesn’t like the embargo because it means Cuba can’t get credit from American banks and largess from multilateral organizations like the World Bank."
