    "body": "<br /><br /><br /><br />Willem van de Velde the Younger (1633-1707) knew the sea and the ships that sailed it. Equally important, this great 17th-century Dutch painter could capture the thrilling rush of excitement when a boat, under full sail, surges through rough waters with spray crashing over its bow. Whether one is a sailor or not, the idea of being at the helm of such a vessel, of controlling its course through skill and fortitude, conveys a sense of freedom and adventure, emotions that have been sorely absent during the pandemic. Van de Velde’s “Ships in a Stormy Sea” (1671-72) is an uplifting and positive image of man’s ability to work in concert with nature rather than having it overwhelm us with its primal energy. Strong contrasts of light and dark heighten the drama, most emphatically in the juxtaposition of the brilliantly lighted, tawny spritsail with the dark, billowing clouds looming behind it. But throughout, flowing rhythms connect these pictorial elements into an organic whole."
