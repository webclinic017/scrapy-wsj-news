    "body": "SEOUL—North Korea has a few demands to restart nuclear talks with the U.S., according to South Korea’s spy agency. Kim Jong Un’s regime wants sanctions restrictions relaxed to allow exporting minerals and importing more refined fuel.<br />Also on the must-have list: fine suits and premium liquor.<br />Seoul’s spy agency on Tuesday briefed lawmakers about the demands from Pyongyang, without disclosing how or when intelligence officials learned of them.<br />Since last week, the two countries have talked multiple times a day after reopening inter-Korean hotlines, following more than a year of silence. It was Kim Jong Un who asked to restore the hotline, Seoul’s spy agency told lawmakers.<br />The Kim regime, its borders still closed over Covid-19 fears, has so far given a cold shoulder to the Biden administration’s diplomatic outreach. The U.S. and North Korea haven’t held formal denuclearization talks since October 2019."
