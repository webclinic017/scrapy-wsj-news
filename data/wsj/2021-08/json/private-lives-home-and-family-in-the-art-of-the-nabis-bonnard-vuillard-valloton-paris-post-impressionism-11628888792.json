    "body": "<br /><br /><br />Cleveland<br />Having emerged from lockdown, with fresh perspectives on life during quarantine, we are well-primed, perhaps, for “Private Lives: Home and Family in the Art of the Nabis, Paris, 1889-1900,” an exhibition at the Cleveland Museum of Art. Co-organized by CMA chief curator Heather Lemonedes Brown and Mary Weaver Chapin, a curator at Oregon’s Portland Art Museum (where the show opens in October), “Private Lives” explores the domestic-themed pictures, mostly interiors, by the four chief members of the Nabis: Félix Vallotton (1865-1925), Pierre Bonnard (1867-1947), Edouard Vuillard (1868-1940) and Maurice Denis (1870-1943)."
