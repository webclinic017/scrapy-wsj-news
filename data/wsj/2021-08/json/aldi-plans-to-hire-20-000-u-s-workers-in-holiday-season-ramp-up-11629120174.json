    "body": "Discount supermarket chain Aldi aims to hire more than 20,000 workers in the U.S. this year as its network grows and as it prepares for holiday shopping, the company said Monday.<br />Jobs that Aldi is hiring for include cashiers, stockers and associates at its more than 2,100 American stores and its 25 warehouses. The company will be drawing from a tight U.S. labor market in which openings have recently exceeded the number of people looking for work.<br />Against that backdrop, wages have been rising, including for low-skilled workers. Following a recent internal wage rise at Aldi, workers in the new positions will earn a national average of $15 an hour for store jobs and $19 an hour for warehouse jobs, the company said. The jobs come with healthcare and retirement plans and paid time off, Aldi said.<br />Other large retailers have cited hiring as a challenge in recent months.<br />“We’re seeing some pressure on labor in certain markets and in some of our distribution centers,” Albertsons Cos. Chief Executive Vivek Sankaran told analysts on a call last month. “The way we’re seeing the pressure there is more from turnover and the ability to fill jobs.”"
