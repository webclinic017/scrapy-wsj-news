    "body": "The World Health Organization called Wednesday for a moratorium on Covid-19 booster shots until at least the end of September to address a shortfall in vaccine supplies to poor countries.<br />The call came as some rich-country governments said they would start administering booster shots to increase protection for those most at risk from Covid-19, while others, such as the U.S. and U.K., have said they are studying the matter.<br />The WHO’s appeal highlights the tension between national governments’ desire to protect their own populations and what global public-health experts say is the longer-term risk that, if the virus is allowed to circulate freely in poorer countries, it will have multiple opportunities to mutate into variants that are more successful at defeating vaccines.<br />As the highly infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus is becoming dominant in country after country, Israel has started giving a third shot to its most vulnerable people, while the German and French governments have said they intend to soon.<br />Authorities are also concerned that the protection given by vaccines and previous infections could wane over time in a way that could put people at risk again as winter approaches in the Northern Hemisphere."
