    "body": "No country has won more rugby world cups than New Zealand. No brand is bigger in the global game than its All Blacks.<br />Beneath that aura of success, however, lies a growing vulnerability for rugby in New Zealand: a patchwork of cash-strapped grass-roots clubs and unions, dwindling numbers of volunteers, and an aspiration to promote women’s rugby that lacks sufficient funds.<br />These challenges have led New Zealand Rugby, the governing body locally, to seek investment in a sport that lacks the profile of soccer and basketball in major markets such as the U.S. and China. But it has also unleashed a debate over whether the best way to accomplish that is by bringing in a deep-pocketed outside investor.<br />New Zealand Rugby in early 2021 agreed to sell U.S.private-equity firm Silver Lake a 12.5% stake in a company that would control and develop All Blacks commercial rights. In return, Silver Lake would invest about 387 million New Zealand dollars, equivalent to $273 million, into the game locally and its global development via the All Blacks.<br />The deal was unanimously backed by more than two dozen regional associations and the Māori Rugby Board. But it still needs approval from the New Zealand Rugby Players’ Association. It values the All Blacks at $2.2 billion—similar to the valuation for some NBA and NFL teams in the U.S."
