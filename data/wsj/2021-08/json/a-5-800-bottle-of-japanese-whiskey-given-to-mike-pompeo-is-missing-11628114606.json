    "body": "WASHINGTON—The State Department is looking into what happened to a pricey bottle of whiskey that the government of Japan gave Mike Pompeo when he was serving as U.S. secretary of state<br />Japan’s gift to Mr. Pompeo, worth $5,800, was received in June 2019, according to a report on gifts to U.S. officials from foreign governments filed by the State Department’s chief of protocol. Mr. Pompeo attended the summit of the Group of 20 leading economies that month in Osaka, Japan.<br />While other gifts to Mr. Pompeo, including a silver falcon statue from the Saudi Arabian foreign minister, are marked as being transferred to the State Department’s National Museum of American Diplomacy or elsewhere in the government, the whiskey is marked as “disposition unknown.”<br />“The Department is looking into the matter and has an ongoing inquiry,” the State Department said in an annual report on foreign gifts to be published Thursday in the Federal Register.<br />William Burck, a lawyer for Mr. Pompeo, said the former secretary of state had “no recollection of receiving the bottle of whiskey and does not have any knowledge of what happened to it.”"
