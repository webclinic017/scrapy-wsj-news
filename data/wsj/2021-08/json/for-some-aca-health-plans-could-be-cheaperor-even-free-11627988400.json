    "body": "Whether you have lost your health insurance or simply want a better deal on coverage, here is some good news: Under a Covid-19 stimulus bill Congress passed in March, many people who buy Affordable Care Act plans can qualify for premiums that are cheaper—or even free.<br />It is important to act fast because the window for most people to enroll for 2021 closes Aug. 15, said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow specializing in private health insurance at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation.<br />Here are details on who is eligible for premium assistance, how the assistance works and what to consider before switching policies.<br />The stimulus bill increases premium subsidies in 2021 and 2022 in plans sold by the government-run marketplaces the ACA created. Some people, including those who received unemployment insurance this year, can get subsidies that may entirely eliminate their premiums.<br />For this year and next, the law also does away with a previous income limit on premium assistance, paving the way for some people with incomes as high as $149,000 to benefit."
