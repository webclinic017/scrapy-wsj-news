    "body": "Walt Disney Co.  reached a deal with unions representing workers at  Disney World in Florida that will require workers to show proof of Covid-19 vaccinations, among the first private-sector unions to reach such a deal.<br />The deal between Disney and the Services Trades Council Union will require around 40,000 workers to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 22, according to the agreement, with exemptions considered for medical or religious reasons.<br />Covid-19 vaccine mandates from some of the country’s biggest companies, announced in recent weeks as the Delta variant increases infections and hospitalizations, have thrust labor unions into a debate over ensuring workers’ safety while defending individual rights.  Tyson Foods Inc.,  Disney and  AT&T Inc.  have said that they will mandate vaccinations for thousands of U.S. workers who process chickens, monitor roller coasters and install internet lines.<br />Unions so far have generally accepted initial efforts by U.S. employers to require vaccinations, labor officials said, while pushing for input into medical exemptions and timing of policies that many workers haven’t encountered before.<br />Disney has said that vaccines are the right step for the safety of its employees."
