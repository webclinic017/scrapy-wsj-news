    "body": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand—New Zealand placed its largest city, Auckland, into lockdown for seven days following the first case of Covid-19 in the community since February.<br />Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said officials are assuming the new Covid-19 case is the more contagious Delta variant of the virus, given its global spread. Genetic sequencing that would confirm or disprove that assumption will be available Wednesday.<br />“Going hard and early has worked for us before,” Ms. Ardern told a press conference. “While we know that Delta is a more dangerous enemy to combat, the same actions that overcame the virus last year can be applied to beat it again.”<br />The seven-day lockdown for Auckland will close schools and most businesses and also be imposed on another region, Coromandel, that the infected person, a 58-year-old Auckland man, traveled to. All other parts of the country will be required to lock down for three days.<br />New Zealand has had just over 2,500 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and few deaths, according to data from its health ministry. The country has been helped by a strict initial lockdown last year and its remote island geography. Its borders have been closed to virtually all travelers, except those such as citizens and long-term residents, since March 2020."
