The State Department said some of the violations harmed U.S. national security.<br />Keysight agreed to pay a fine of $6.6 million, with the department suspending $2.5 million if the company spends the funds on compliance measures. The company also agreed to hire an officer to audit its compliance program.<br />“The settlement demonstrates the Department’s role in strengthening U.S. industry by protecting technical data from unauthorized exports,” the State Department said. It also “highlights the importance of obtaining appropriate authorization from the Department for exporting software as well as determining proper export jurisdiction.”"
