    "body": "The chief executive of  T-Mobile US Inc.  apologized to customers for a security breach that has exposed personal data from more than 50 million people and said the wireless company was working to strengthen its cyber defenses.<br />The Bellevue, Wash., company on Friday said it struck long-term partnerships with cybersecurity firm Mandiant and consulting firm KPMG LLG after the hack of its systems that exposed millions of Social Security numbers, birth dates and other data.<br />“We didn’t live up to the expectations we have for ourselves to protect our customers,” CEO Mike Sievert wrote in a public letter. “Knowing that we failed to prevent this exposure is one of the hardest parts of this event.”<br />John Binns, a 21-year-old American who moved to Turkey a few years ago, told The Wall Street Journal he was behind the security breach. He said the company’s lax security eased his path into a cache of  T-Mobile  records. “Their security is awful,” Mr. Binns told the Journal.<br />It wasn’t immediately clear whether Mr. Binns worked alone or with help.  T-Mobile  said Friday the attacker first pierced the company’s testing environments before gaining access to other systems through brute-force attacks and other methods."
