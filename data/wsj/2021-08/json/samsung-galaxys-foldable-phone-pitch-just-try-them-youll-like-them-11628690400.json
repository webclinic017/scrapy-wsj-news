    "body": "SEOUL— Samsung Electronics Co.  is betting the world is finally ready for its foldable phones.<br />Consumers had initially balked at a price tag that hovered around $2,000. Durability remained a concern. Closed stores during the pandemic meant few buyers could see and touch a foldable phone that looks dramatically different from everything else.<br />That has brought an underwhelming debut to what had been one of the smartphone industry’s most-hyped products of late. The device has a tablet-size screen that folds in half like a book, becoming small enough to carry in a hand, pocket or purse. When closed, a second display on the outside can field most tasks.<br />Roh Tae-moon, president of Samsung’s mobile-communications business, said he has heard all the complaints. He is hopeful the company’s two new foldable devices, which were unveiled Wednesday, become more than fringe products in the smartphone market.<br />“We’ve seen that users who have tried foldable phones like the experience and say they want to use them again,” Mr. Roh said. “But it’s hard to discover the value of foldables if they haven’t had a chance to experience them.”"
