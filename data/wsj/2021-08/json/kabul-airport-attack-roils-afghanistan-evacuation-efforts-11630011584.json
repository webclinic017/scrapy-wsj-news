    "body": "A pair of explosions at the Kabul airport claimed the lives of 12 U.S. service members and at least 60 Afghans as the U.S.-led evacuation efforts in Afghanistan raced against an Aug. 31 withdrawal deadline. Another 15 service members and many more Afghans were wounded.<br />At the time of the attack, approaches to the airportâ€™s gates were packed with thousands of Afghans. Marine Corps Gen. Frank McKenzie, commander of U.S. Central Command, said ISIS-K was responsible for the attack.<br />The U.S. believes a suicide bomber detonated at the front of the gate as he was attempting to get onto the airport compound.<br />The American deaths on Thursday were the first U.S. military combat fatalities in Afghanistan since February 2020, when the Trump administration and the Taliban signed an agreement on withdrawing U.S. troops. It makes August the deadliest month for U.S. troops in Afghanistan since 2013.<br />The attack has further complicated evacuation efforts at the airport, which had been ramping up in recent days. The U.S. plans to continue with its evacuation of U.S. citizens and allied Afghans, Gen. McKenzie told reporters Thursday. He said the U.S. estimates that around 1,000 Americans remain in Afghanistan."
