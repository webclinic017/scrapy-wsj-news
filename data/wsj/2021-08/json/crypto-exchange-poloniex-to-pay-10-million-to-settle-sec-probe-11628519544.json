    "body": "WASHINGTON—An unregulated cryptocurrency exchange whose employees said they wanted to be aggressive about trading digital assets, even though their legal status was uncertain, has agreed to pay $10 million to settle a regulatory investigation.<br />Poloniex LLC violated investor-protection laws by not registering its operations with federal regulators, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Monday. The Boston-based company allowed users to trade digital assets that were unregistered securities from 2017 through 2019, the SEC alleged.<br />Poloniex agreed to settle the SEC’s investigation without admitting or denying the claims. An attorney for the company didn’t immediately return messages seeking comment.<br />The SEC has recently vowed to bring accountability to a crypto sector that Chairman Gary Gensler this month called the “Wild West.” Mr. Gensler said last week that crypto exchanges should consult with the SEC about whether the assets they trade qualify as securities, and therefore should be registered with the market regulator.<br />The start of the SEC’s investigation of Poloniex predated Mr. Gensler’s remarks. The agency’s enforcement investigations typically take between one and two years to complete."
