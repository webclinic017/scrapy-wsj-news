    "body": "WASHINGTON—U.S. intelligence agencies are unable to determine conclusively how the Covid-19 pandemic emerged, a summary of a classified report released Friday said.<br />Four agencies assessed, with low confidence, that it reached humans via infected animals, the summary said, but one argued with moderate confidence that it was the result of a lab accident.<br />The summary, drawn from a much longer classified report presented to President Biden on Tuesday, is unequivocal on two major points.<br />“We judge the virus was not developed as a biological weapon,” it stated. And, it said, U.S. spy agencies don’t think that Chinese officials had foreknowledge of the virus, SARS-COV-2, before the outbreak emerged.<br />Most agencies assessed, though with low confidence, that the virus wasn’t genetically engineered, although two said there wasn’t enough information to make a judgment, the report stated."
