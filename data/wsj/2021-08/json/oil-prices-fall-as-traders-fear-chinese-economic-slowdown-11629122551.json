    "body": "Oil prices fell on Monday, extending a recent stretch of turbulent trading after data showing that China’s economic recovery slowed more than anticipated last month.<br />U.S. crude prices fell as much as 4% before ending the day down 1.7% at $67.29 a barrel. They are near their lowest levels since late May and 11% below last month’s multiyear high. Prices have retreated as cases of the Delta variant of the coronavirus surge around the world, fueling fears that a new wave of travel restrictions will soften demand for fuel.<br />The spread of the Delta variant and extreme weather contributed to a larger-than-expected slowdown in China’s economy in July, figures released Monday showed. Indicators of industrial, consumption and investment activity all showed growth retreating faster than expected and decelerating from June’s yearly growth rates.<br />The data are a concern for commodity traders because China is the world’s largest importer of oil and a huge consumer of other raw materials such as copper. Weakness in China’s economy can quickly spread around the world, analysts say, particularly when travel patterns and supply chains are being disrupted as they are now due to the coronavirus.<br />“Concerns about the spread of the Delta variant in China, and the effects this will have on oil demand, are continuing to weigh on prices,” Commerzbank analysts said in a note."
