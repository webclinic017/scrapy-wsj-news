    "body": "According to Drs. Marty Makary and H. Cody Meissner in “The Case Against Masks for Children” (op-ed, Aug. 9), “Forcing [children] to make personal, health and developmental sacrifices for the sake of adults who refuse to get immunized is abusive.” What about vaccinated but immunocompromised adults for whom the vaccine is only somewhat effective? Isn’t it abusive to them to have to risk their lives to spare children the far-from-lethal pains of being masked?<br />Prof. Felicia Nimue Ackerman<br />Brown University<br />Providence, R.I.<br />"
