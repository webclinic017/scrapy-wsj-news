    "body": "OTTAWA—Canada’s border agents started labor action on Friday that threatens the flow of U.S.-Canada trade and could upend a plan to allow American tourists starting Monday to visit their northern neighbor for the first time in 16 months.<br />Overnight talks between the union representing about 9,000 employees at the Canada Border Services Agency and the Canadian government failed to produce a new agreement before a 6 a.m. Eastern time Friday deadline. The Public Service Alliance of Canada, which represents customs and immigration officers, said members would now begin paring back services at land crossings, airports and shipping ports. Such a move, it warned, could cause long and unavoidable delays for shippers and travelers at Canada’s borders.<br />The bargaining team “has been at the table all night, and we’re giving them a bit more time to negotiate,” the alliance said in a message published via its  Twitter  account. “In the meantime, work-to-rule actions have started across the country.”<br />A Canadian government representative wasn’t immediately available to comment on the state of talks. A mediator was brought in midweek to help resolve differences, which the union says focus on working conditions and compensation.<br />The border agency said this week it was ready to respond to possible labor disruption to maintain border security and keep the border open to legitimate travelers and goods."
