    "body": "It is disheartening to read Sen. Bernie Sanders’s explanation of the need for a dramatic increase in the scope of government, without a single word regarding the risks or the certainty of unintended consequences (“Why We Need the $3.5 Trillion Reconciliation Package,” op-ed, Aug. 4). Europe already has much of what he proposes, and the consequences are clear: chronic higher unemployment (severe among the young), lower gross domestic product and high taxes that discourage risk-taking.<br />If Mr. Sanders believes these trade-offs are worth it, he should say so and make his case, instead of pretending all will be wonderful as government expands. By the way, taxation in Europe is less progressive than ours, with the middle class paying a far higher share. That is precisely what will happen if his plan passes.<br />Ari Weitzner<br />New York<br />"
