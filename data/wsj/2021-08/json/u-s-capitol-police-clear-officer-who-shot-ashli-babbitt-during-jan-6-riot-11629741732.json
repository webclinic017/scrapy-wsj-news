    "body": "WASHINGTON—The police officer who shot and killed Ashli Babbitt during the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol won’t face discipline after a monthslong internal investigation cleared him of any wrongdoing.<br />The U.S. Capitol Police said the officer, whom officials haven’t publicly identified out of concerns for his safety, acted lawfully and adhered to department policy, which says police can use deadly force to defend their own lives and others’.<br />“The actions of the officer in this case potentially saved Members and staff from serious injury and possible death from a large crowd of rioters who forced their way into the U.S. Capitol and to the House Chamber where Members and staff were steps away,” Capitol Police said in announcing the results of the probe.<br />The officer, a lieutenant, shot Ms. Babbitt after rioters smashed through a door to the Speaker’s Lobby on Jan. 6. Ms. Babbitt had entered the building as part of a pro-Trump crowd aiming to disrupt the certification of President Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election.<br />Federal prosecutors in April announced the officer wouldn’t face criminal charges in connection with Ms. Babbitt’s killing, whose death has become a rallying cry for some far-right activists. She had served for more than a dozen years in the Air Force and Air National Guard and became a passionate supporter of former President Donald Trump."
