    "body": "HONG KONG—Chinese authorities said 302 people had died during severe flooding that hit the central province of Henan last month, a sharp increase in the death toll that comes as rescue workers extract more bodies from the provincial capital Zhengzhou and the surrounding countryside.<br />The death count makes the disaster one of the deadliest in China in recent years, with 50 people still missing, Henan provincial authorities said at a briefing Monday. The death toll marked a threefold jump from the official figure of 99 deaths released Thursday last week.<br />Henan province was battered by record rainfall in late July, with nearly a year’s worth of rainfall pouring down on the city in the span of three days, according to meteorological officials in Zhengzhou. The city of more than 12 million residents was among the worst-hit areas, accounting for more than 95% of all deaths.<br />Local news reports and social-media posts showed inundated neighborhoods and harrowing scenes of commuters stuck chest-deep in flooded subway cars. Out of more than 500 passengers trapped during the evening rush hour in the metro, at least 14 people ended up dying.<br />According to Henan’s provincial government, 189 people were killed in the city of Zhengzhou alone due to flooding and mudslides, while another 50 residents in the provincial capital died when houses collapsed due to the torrential rain."
