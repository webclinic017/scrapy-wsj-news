    "body": "It should not come as a surprise that President Biden accepted the terms dictated by the Taliban and is sticking to the Aug. 31 deadline to complete the pullout from Afghanistan (“Biden’s Rush to the Afghan Exits,” Review & Outlook, Aug. 25). Mr. Biden was one of the few in President Barack Obama’s inner circle to oppose the Osama bin Laden raid. The evidence points to Mr. Biden’s extraordinary fear of failure. Where there is risk, this leader of the free world is risk-averse.<br />Given the Morton’s fork of leaving next week, with thousands of U.S. citizens and Afghan friends stranded and left behind, or defying the Taliban and extending the exit date until all are extricated—possibly resulting in renewed combat requiring many more troops—Mr. Biden chose the lower-risk option. He seems not to consider the unintended consequences that might follow. Not exactly a model in responsible leadership.<br />Fred Ehrman<br />New York<br />"
