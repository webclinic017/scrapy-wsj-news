Seth Moulton (D., Mass) and Peter Meijer (R., Mich.) transited through the United Arab Emirates on a commercial airline and then, with no staff and without alerting congressional leadership or administration officials, took military flights on a U.S. ally’s planes in and out of Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul<br />While they were in transit on their return trip, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), warned fellow members of Congress in an official memo not to attempt to visit Afghanistan.<br />“I write to reiterate that the Departments of Defense and State have requested that Members not travel to Afghanistan and the region during this time of danger,” she said in the letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. She said briefings and phone calls would provide information from the executive branch.<br />The two lawmakers said that information on the U.S. evacuation in Afghanistan was often out of date by the time it made it to the legislative branch."
