    "body": "It has been a difficult summer for the world’s second-largest economy—a fact fully confirmed by China’s official August purchasing managers’ indexes, released Tuesday. The big question now is how Beijing will respond.<br />The economy needs more support to avoid a steeper fall in growth, but that may be difficult to engineer without easing restrictions on the critical real-estate sector. Regulators are determined to prevent another sharp rise in leverage.<br />The reason for the vertiginous drop in the services sector index, from 52.5 to 45.2, is already well known: Efforts to contain the Delta variant outbreak originating in Nanjing hammered tourism and shut down some important cities in the country’s eastern economic heartland. With the outbreak now apparently under control, a strong rebound is likely in September—although consumer hesitancy, a tough labor market for young people, and the damage to household balance sheets from last year’s spring shutdowns will continue to prevent a full recovery to the pre-2020 trend.<br />But the weakness wasn’t confined to services, which tend to be most vulnerable to lockdowns. Factories’ new export orders fell to their lowest level since June 2020. And overall new orders fell through the 50 point mark separating expansion from contraction for the first time since the dark days of February 2020—though just barely.<br />That latter dip probably has a lot to do with the struggles of the property sector. Broader August economic data isn’t available yet, but property investment in July rose only 1.4% year over year, the smallest gain since March 2020. Curbs on property developer leverage are starting to bite, and bite hard. Output growth in heavy industrial products tied to real estate has also taken a dive in the past few months, although some of that is related to Beijing’s efforts to cap steel output at 2020 levels this year. Infrastructure investment has also weakened."
