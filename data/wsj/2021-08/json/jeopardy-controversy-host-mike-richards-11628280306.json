    "body": "Answer: This “Jeopardy!” insider was revealed to be a leading candidate for the role of full-time host of the game show, bringing climactic drama to an eight-month search process that has roiled the trivia institution and divided fans.<br />Question: Who is Mike Richards?<br />That’s also what many “Jeopardy!” followers are asking amid fierce debate about whether Mr. Richards, the show’s executive producer, is the right person to succeed Alex Trebek. News of his front-runner status, reported earlier by Variety, came as a shock to many who expected the job to go to a more high-profile candidate, such as record-setting “Jeopardy!” champion Ken Jennings, NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers or actor LeVar Burton, whose recent tryout was backed by an online fan campaign.<br />Sony  Pictures Television, the studio that produces “Jeopardy!,” said discussions are ongoing with several candidates for full-time host.<br />At stake is the next chapter for one of television’s most valuable properties. The search for a replacement to Mr. Trebek, a pop-culture icon and the show’s host of 36 years, unfolded as a game of its own, featuring 14 different guest hosts—some doing it for charity, others openly lobbying for the full-time job. However, the show lost some steam in the ratings over the course of the season-long process, which created factions among fans who felt invested in the tryouts."
