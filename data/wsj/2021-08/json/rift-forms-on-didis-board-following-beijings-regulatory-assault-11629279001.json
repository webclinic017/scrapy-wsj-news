    "body": "<br />A rift has developed among the top executives of three of China’s internet giants, in the wake of  Didi Global Inc.’s  ill-fated decision to go public in New York.<br />Didi’s eight-member board of directors—which includes leaders of  Tencent Holdings Ltd.  and  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. —approved the ride-hailing company’s plan to push through with a $4.4 billion U.S. initial public offering in June, even though the country’s cybersecurity watchdog had suggested to Didi that it postpone its share sale.<br />After the listing, Tencent President Martin Lau and Alibaba Chairman and Chief Executive Daniel Zhang were surprised and furious when they learned that Didi was in trouble with the Cyberspace Administration of China, according to people familiar with the matter. Tencent and Alibaba are longtime shareholders of Didi.<br />Two of the people said Didi executives didn’t fully inform the board about the the cyberspace regulator’s concerns prior to the IPO, making it hard for board members to fully ascertain the risks of going ahead."
