Bush’s decision to invade Iraq, Barack Obama’s refusal to enforce his own red line in Syria, Donald Trump’s surrender agreement with the Taliban, and Joe Biden’s chaotic withdrawal from Kabul, the question must be asked: Has the U.S. become the Tom and Daisy Buchanan of world politics? And what can the Biden administration do now to mitigate the damage inflicted on our friends, our allies and ourselves?<br />We don’t have time for a 12-step recovery program, so here are three.<br />Step one: Honor our commitments to our friends in Afghanistan. This one is simple: America should not end operations in Kabul until all U.S. citizens and their families who want to leave, and those of our coalition partners, have departed the country. We should extend a similar guarantee to the Afghans who have aided our efforts over the past two decades.<br />This means, at a minimum, keeping forces in Kabul until the job is done, not abiding by an artificial timetable. The Taliban has threatened unspecified consequences if the U.S. delays its departure past Aug. 31. We should make it clear to the Taliban’s leaders that we have no intention of allowing their preferences to dictate our decisions."
