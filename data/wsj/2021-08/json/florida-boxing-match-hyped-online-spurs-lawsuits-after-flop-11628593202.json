    "body": "A pay-per-view boxing tournament featuring YouTube and TikTok personalities has turned into a legal brawl after it failed to live up to its social-media hype, pushing the event’s organizer to consider bankruptcy.<br />The June event, dubbed Social Gloves, posted only 136,000 pay-per-view sales, a fraction of an expected 2.2 million in sales, according to lawsuits filed by its live-streaming platform and talent against the organizer, Austin McBroom.<br />His business, Simply Greatness Productions LLC, has said it may have to file for bankruptcy to sort out the competing claims against it, according to papers in state court in California.<br />A lawyer for Mr. McBroom, a YouTube personality with more than 19 million subscribers, declined to comment. Court records show he faces lawsuits over the Miami Gardens, Fla.-based event filed by boxers and its live-streaming platform, LiveXLive Media Inc. It has said Mr. McBroom defamed it and caused its share price to fall more than 20%.<br />Simply Greatness has filed its own lawsuit against LiveXLive, alleging it failed to properly market the boxing tournament and hasn’t turned over any of the millions of dollars in revenue the event generated."
