    "body": "Obaidullah Amin made his way last week to the Kabul airport with his wife, Maryam, and their two children, joining thousands of other Afghans desperate to board a plane to safety.<br />Unlike many others teeming outside the terminal, Mr. Amin had a golden ticket—a letter from a member of Congress attesting to his work as a translator for the U.S. military and urging his evacuation.<br />“Introduce yourself to Marines, show the letter, stand strong,” Andrew Darlington, a former Marine Captain who worked with Mr. Amin on a deployment to Afghanistan, texted him from his home in Florida. “You have served with them, introduce yourself. You’re one of us.”<br />Mr. Amin would still need to get through the crowds and past the security checkpoint at Abbey Gate. Mr. Darlington also gave him a plan for that: Carry a sign with the numbers “1,2,3,4” on it. That was a code for Marines at the gate to expedite his path.<br />The Amins almost made it. But as they neared the checkpoint last Thursday, a suicide bomber detonated 25 pounds of explosives, killing Mr. Amin, his wife and more than 200 others, including 13 Americans, most of them Marines."
