    "body": "WASHINGTON—Ten Republican senators have signed on as co-sponsors of a bipartisan bill to repeal the 1991 and 2002 authorizations for use of military force in Iraq, a key threshold needed to overcome a Senate filibuster.<br />It is the latest sign that lawmakers of both parties are gaining traction in their efforts to reassert Congress’s constitutional power to declare war, the culmination of years of debate over the commander in chief’s latitude to send troops into combat abroad, and a reflection of waning public support for America’s so-called forever wars.<br />The Senate’s longstanding filibuster rule requires at least 60 votes for most legislation to advance. In the evenly divided 100-person chamber, that means at least 10 Republicans would have to join with all 50 Democrats in order for the repeal to succeed.<br />The legislation, led by Sens. Todd Young (R., Ind.) and Tim Kaine (D., Va.), would repeal both the 2002 Iraq War and 1991 Gulf War authorizations.<br />The measure passed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with support from members of both parties on Wednesday, 14-8."
