    "body": "Ford Motor Co.  said it would halt delivery of some new Bronco sport-utility vehicles because of a production problem, a high-profile setback as the auto maker tries to address nagging quality issues.<br />Ford said Thursday that it will replace the roofs on some of the SUVs it has produced so far because of a problem that affects appearance, though not  functionality. The fixes will cause a delay for customers who had ordered Broncos, which went on sale in June, a spokesman said.<br />Ford said the molded, hardtop roofs made by German supplier Webasto Group for some Broncos didn’t meet Ford’s standards.<br />A spokesperson for Webasto didn’t immediately return a request for comment.<br />Ford also makes a soft-top version of the Bronco that it will continue to ship to customers, the spokesman said."
