    "body": "Jefferies Financial Group Inc.  will match  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  at the top of Wall Street’s pay scale for younger bankers, according to people familiar with the matter, in a bid to go head-to-head with better-known rivals.<br />First-year analysts in the U.S. will now make $110,000, up from $85,000, while second-year analysts will rise to $125,000 from $95,000 and associates, those in their third year, will go to $150,000 from $125,000, the people said. Bonuses, typically handed out in August, are also expected to be high, one of the people added.<br />The base rates will match the 30% raises Goldman handed out a week ago, which put it as the highest on the Street. Earlier this year JPMorgan Chase & Co.,  Citigroup Inc.  and  Morgan Stanley  all moved their first-year pay up to $100,000 from $85,000.<br />That Jefferies is climbing above bigger peers is a sign of the widespread nature of Wall Street’s recruiting war.<br />JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are at the top of the industry league tables for total investment-banking revenue and sport market values of $470 billion and $135 billion, respectively. Jefferies has climbed into the eighth spot on the league tables and has a market capitalization of $8.6 billion."
