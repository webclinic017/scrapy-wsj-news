    "body": "The supersonic Concorde jet made its last commercial passenger flight on Oct. 24, 2003. The Anglo-French plane was a wonder to watch, but could never overcome its high costs and concerns over its noise.<br />Is supersonic travel ready for its next act?<br />In June,  United Airlines Holdings Inc.  said it would buy 15 small supersonic jets being developed by Boom Technology Inc. Boom hopes to fly a scaled-down prototype of the so-called Overture jets later this year, with the full-size jet ready by the end of the decade.<br />Boom says the jets would be able to fly at Mach 1.7, or 1.7 times the speed of sound, enabling passengers to fly from London to Newark, N.J., in 3½ hours; it currently takes over six hours. A flight from San Francisco to Tokyo would take six hours, down from over 10 hours.<br />Proponents say this can happen, if entrepreneurial vision and market forces are allowed to work. Skeptics doubt that the demand will be there, given the likely cost of a ticket."
