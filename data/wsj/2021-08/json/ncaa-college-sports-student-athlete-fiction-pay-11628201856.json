    "body": "I applaud Prof. Thomas Miller Jr.’s attempt, in extending scholarships, to reconcile the obvious incompatibility of a traditional four-year academic education in a rigorous discipline with the fiction of the student-athlete (“Student-Athletes Deserve 10-Year Scholarships,” op-ed, July 29).<br />The current system, including the redshirt year, does not permit the student-athlete to pursue a degree in a rigorous subject. Consequently, less-than-rigorous majors such as parks administration developed for student-athletes. I recall during the 1950s, when the profiles of the players and their majors were announced at halftime during bowl games, it was common to hear pre-med, pre-law, economics, history, etc. Rarely, if ever, do I hear those academic pursuits cited today, if players’ academic profiles are cited at all.<br />Student-athletes now can expect to meet relaxed admissions standards. This is true for many colleges, save perhaps the Ivies and the military academies—which is why their Division I teams are so bad. Effectively, student-athletes are gaining “admission” to pursue their sports. Why not simply hire them for their athletic talents and pay them salaries for those four or five years of playing time?<br />Would this not be far more honest than attempting to put a round peg in a square hole?<br />Alan R.
