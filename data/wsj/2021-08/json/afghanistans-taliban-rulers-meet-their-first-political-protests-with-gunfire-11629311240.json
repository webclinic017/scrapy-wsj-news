    "body": "The Taliban met with gunfire the first political protests they faced after seizing power in Afghanistan, killing at least two people and injuring several others as they dispersed demonstrators who waved the flag of the fallen Afghan republic.<br />The Taliban’s Islamic Emirate has its own white flag emblazoned with Islamic scripture—the same verse is also there in the republic flag, less prominently. The movement raised it in the Afghan cities that they conquered in the blitz offensive that culminated with Sunday’s collapse of the Afghan state and the escape of President Ashraf Ghani to the United Arab Emirates.<br />On Wednesday, protesters gathered in several parts of the eastern cities of Jalalabad, Khost and Asadabad to take down the Emirate’s white flag and to hoist the black-red-green banner of the Republic. Hundreds of protesters chanted “God is great” and “long live the flag.”<br />These demonstrations erupted as the remnants of opposition to the Taliban began mobilizing for a possible armed resistance in one of the few places in the country not yet conquered by the militants, the Panjshir valley northeast of Kabul. Panjshir was one the last redoubts of resistance to the Taliban before the 2001 U.S. invasion.<br />The Taliban are seeking to portray themselves as more tolerant than their harsh regime of the 1990s."
