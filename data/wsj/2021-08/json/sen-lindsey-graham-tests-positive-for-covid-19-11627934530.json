    "body": "WASHINGTON—Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) has tested positive for Covid-19 despite being vaccinated and will quarantine for 10 days, he said Monday, raising concerns about the possible spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant on Capitol Hill.<br />Mr. Graham said he started feeling sick on Saturday night and went to the doctor Monday morning. Mr. Graham described his symptoms as mild—similar to a sinus infection—and credited the vaccine for ensuring he wasn’t more seriously ill.<br />“I am very glad I was vaccinated because without vaccination I am certain I would not feel as well as I do now,” Mr. Graham said. “My symptoms would be far worse.”<br />The news of his breakthrough case hit the Senate as lawmakers push to finalize a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, with a series of amendment votes and procedural hurdles in the coming days.<br />Masking has become a partisan flashpoint on Capitol Hill. Republicans typically oppose mask mandates while Democrats have begun wearing face coverings again."
