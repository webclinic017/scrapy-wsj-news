    "body": "WASHINGTON—Investors barely reacted last week when Federal Reserve officials signaled they could announce plans to start reducing their bond buying later this year. That was a relief for policy makers eager to avoid a repeat of the market turmoil that erupted in 2013 when the Fed made a similar announcement.<br />The Fed’s next test will come when it outlines a concrete plan for when and how it will scale back, or taper, the asset purchases.<br />The central bank has been buying $120 billion a month of Treasury and mortgage securities since June 2020, a pace officials say will continue until the economic recovery advances further. By bidding up the price of long-term bonds, the purchases tend to hold down borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, since bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.<br />Some investors worry that yields will jump significantly higher when the Fed stops buying bonds. The Fed’s indication in 2013 that it would eventually wind down an earlier bond-buying program sparked such an episode, dubbed the taper tantrum.<br />But research by economists and Fed staff in recent years has found that tapering need not provoke a tantrum."
