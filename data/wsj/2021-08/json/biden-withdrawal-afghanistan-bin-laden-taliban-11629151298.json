    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Biden’s Afghanistan Surrender” (Aug. 16): In the span of weeks this president has undone the hard work of our troops over 20 years. He has allowed the same Islamic extremists who harbored Osama bin Laden to take back a country we vowed never to let fall into those hands again. The horror that will be inflicted on our allies, as well as the reversal of progress we have made for women there, are due to this feckless leader.<br />President Biden’s own military advisers told him that with a contingent of several thousand soldiers we could assist the Afghan government in holding the Taliban to a standstill, until a true settlement could be reached. Instead, Mr. Biden chose his Saigon moment, and no one will ever forget or forgive this disgrace. We have now told our adversaries that we will not finish the fight, which is what bin Laden banked on when he arranged the 9/11 attacks.<br />John R. Madden<br />Tiburon, Calif.<br />"
