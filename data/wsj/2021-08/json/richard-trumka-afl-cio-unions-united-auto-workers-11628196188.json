    "body": "From the Journal’s Sept. 19, 2009, Weekend Interview with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who died Thursday at 72:<br /><br />“Workers don’t get to bargain over the type of car that’s produced,” he says. “We don’t get to bargain over what kind of capital expenditures will be made. We’re prohibited from doing that. Quite frankly we believe that a good manager is a worker’s best friend. A bad manager—we pay the price every time. A guy who got up everyday and built the best car that he could, how is he at fault?”<br />“Well, if he made double what the worker at a transplant foreign carmaker in Alabama . . .”<br />Mr. Trumka jumps in: “What about the guy on Wall Street that made $2 billion a year. Is he at fault? . . .”"
