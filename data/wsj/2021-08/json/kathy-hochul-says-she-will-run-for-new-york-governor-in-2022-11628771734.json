    "body": "New York Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul said she would run for governor in the state’s 2022 race, making her the first Democrat to announce her plans for the office since Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced his resignation.<br />Ms. Hochul will succeed Mr. Cuomo as governor in 12 days, after he said earlier this week that he was stepping down following a state attorney general report that found he had violated state and federal sexual-harassment laws. Mr. Cuomo has called the report’s findings false.<br />Ms. Hochul said Thursday that as she finishes out the last 15 months of Mr. Cuomo’s term as governor, New Yorkers will see she is the most prepared candidate in the 2022 race.<br />“I am confident they will see that I fight like hell every single day,” she said in an interview with NBC’s “Today.”<br />Ms. Hochul also said her priority as governor is getting students back to school and that she would consider a mask mandate."
