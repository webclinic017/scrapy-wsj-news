    "body": "MILANâ€”As Covid-19 vaccine mandates proliferate in the U.S. and Europe, so are swindlers selling bogus vaccination certificates.<br />The U.S. government has said federal workers must be vaccinated or submit to regular testing, mask requirements and social distancing. California requires state employees to be vaccinated or tested at least once a week. New York state will soon follow and New York City plans to require proof of vaccination for customers and staff at restaurants and gyms.<br />Employers such as  Walt Disney Co. ,  Walmart Inc.,   Microsoft Corp.  and  Tyson Foods Inc.  are requiring vaccination for at least some of their employees.<br />Proof of vaccination is required in parts of the U.S. and Europe to dine indoors, go to museums and attend large sporting events.<br />The spread of such rules has created a market for counterfeit certificates for the unvaccinated. In recent weeks, schemes to sell illegal proof of vaccination have multiplied on social-media sites, messaging apps such as Telegram and on the dark web, according to government investigators and cybersecurity experts."
