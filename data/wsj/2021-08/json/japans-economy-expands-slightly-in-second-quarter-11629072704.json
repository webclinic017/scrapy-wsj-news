    "body": "TOKYO—Japan’s economy grew slightly in the second quarter of 2021 as private consumption recovered slowly.<br />The world’s third-largest economy has struggled this year to recover from last year’s Covid-19 downturn. Repeated states of emergency in Tokyo and other cities have limited consumer spending in restaurants and stores.<br />In the April-June quarter, the Japanese economy expanded 0.3%, compared with 0.9% contraction in the previous quarter and consensus forecasts for 0.2% growth. It grew 1.3% on an annualized basis, which reflects what would happen if the second-quarter pace continued for a full year.<br />Economists expect growth to remain sluggish in the current quarter ending in September as a wave of Covid-19 Delta variant infections sweeps the country.<br />The Tokyo Summer Olympics, which took place from July 23 to Aug. 8, provided little boost because spectators were barred at most events and the small number of Olympic participants visiting Japan were confined to limited areas."
