    "body": "AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.  officially has top billing in the meme-stock craze of Wall Street.<br />Chief Executive Adam Aron on Monday used the company’s earnings call, which is typically a staid recitation of quarterly finances, to rally his Reddit troops and announce several changes coming to his company thanks to the suggestions of the loyal, so-called apes.<br />Over the more than hourlong call, Mr. Aron took questions from nearly a dozen retail investors—and one from a Wall Street analyst. The questions ranged from the viability of drive-in theaters (“a bad economic idea”) to whether the company would ever partner with fellow meme-stock company  GameStop  to bring gaming entertainment to AMC auditoriums (“We’re on the case”).<br />Mr. Aron also announced the company would start accepting bitcoin at U.S. locations because of the investor community’s enthusiasm for cryptocurrency, and said he was putting AMC “on the offensive” and buying new locations thanks to the bullish support of his supporters.<br />It was a case study in the surreal and unprecedented year AMC has had. Last year, lockdowns and capacity restrictions drove the theater chain to the brink of bankruptcy. Now, AMC is “on the offensive,” Mr. Aron said, buoyed by the retail investor enthusiasm and a halting return to moviegoing around the world. AMC’s revenue tripled in the June quarter from the year’s first three months."
