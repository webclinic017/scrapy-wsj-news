    "body": "Hong Kong’s stock exchange has seen a jump in listing inquiries, the bourse operator’s chief said Wednesday, after regulators in Beijing and Washington pledged to make it harder for companies from China to go public on American stock exchanges.<br />Nicolas Aguzin, the new CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., said in his first earnings call with the media that around 200 companies currently have applications to list in the city. “There have been significantly more inquiries” about listing in Hong Kong as the result of the tightening scrutiny from the U.S. and China, he said.<br />The former investment banker’s comments came after the exchange operator reported record revenue and net profit for the six months to June 30. HKEX’s profit of $849.4 million was up 26% from the same period a year ago, driven by strong trading volumes and a buoyant market for initial public offerings. Its revenue and other income jumped 24% to about $1.4 billion.<br />Hong Kong has attracted numerous IPOs from Chinese companies, such as short-video app operator Kuaishou Technology, and listings from companies in China whose shares already trade on U.S. exchanges.<br />A total of 46 companies raised more than $27 billion in the first half from stock offerings in the Asian financial hub, more than double that from the same period last year."
