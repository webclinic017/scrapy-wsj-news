    "body": "Scarlett Johansson isn’t the only movie star with concerns about how Hollywood’s focus on streaming could affect her pay. She’s just the one that went public.<br />Ms. Johansson sued Walt Disney Co., saying its simultaneous release of “Black Widow” in theaters and on the Disney+ streaming service breached her contract and hurt her financially.<br />Disney says her suit has no merit.<br />Though there haven’t been other suits like hers, representatives for actors, producers and directors have been privately battling big entertainment companies, including Disney,  AT&T Inc.’s  WarnerMedia and  ViacomCBS Inc.,  over the best model for paying talent.<br />Talent representatives usually try to keep such disputes under wraps to avoid public showdowns that could damage relationships with all the other entertainment companies owned by the same corporate parent as the studio."
