Greg Abbott tested positive for Covid-19 Tuesday, his office said.<br />He was fully vaccinated against the virus and wasn’t symptomatic, his spokesman Mark Miner said.<br />“The Governor has been testing daily, and today was the first positive test result,” Mr. Miner said in the news release. “Governor Abbott is in constant communication with his staff, agency heads, and government officials to ensure that state government continues to operate smoothly and efficiently.”<br />Mr. Miner said Mr. Abbott is receiving Regeneron’s monoclonal antibody treatment and will isolate himself at home in the Austin Governor’s Mansion. His wife, Cecilia Abbott, tested negative. Mr. Miner said all close contacts of the governor had been notified. The positive test comes less than 24 hours after Mr. Abbott posted photos and video of himself at a packed Republican event in North Texas with hundreds of people.<br />Tuesday’s news comes as Texas is experiencing a new wave of the virus.
