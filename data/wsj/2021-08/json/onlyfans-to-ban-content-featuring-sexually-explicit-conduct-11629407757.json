    "body": "OnlyFans, a social-media platform whose popularity was built on viewers’ subscriptions to adult content, is planning to ban sex videos.<br />OnlyFans said Thursday that starting Oct. 1, it will prohibit content that features “sexually-explicit conduct” but it will allow creators to post nudity. The platform, owned by closely held London-based Fenix International Ltd., said the changes are to comply with the requests of banking partners and payment processors.<br />OnlyFans has in recent months been looking to raise money, according to a person familiar with the matter. Many investors historically have avoided certain categories of vice, including pornography.<br />“In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the platform, and to continue to host an inclusive community of creators and fans, we must evolve our content guidelines,” the company said. Bloomberg earlier reported the news.<br />OnlyFans founder Tim Stokely created the website in 2016 as a paid social-media site for adults with more liberal content policies than the traditional platforms like  Facebook  and Instagram. While the site is best known for its porn stars, its recent growth is due in part to the company’s efforts to diversify its content, Mr. Stokely said at The Wall Street Journal’s Future of Everything Festival in May. During the past year, OnlyFans has attracted more creators who focus on fitness, food and fashion."
