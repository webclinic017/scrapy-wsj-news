    "body": "Reading George Soros’s op-ed “Xi’s Dictatorship Threatens the Chinese State” (Aug. 14), I have a question: How can a man write such a clear, perceptive assessment of the dangers coming from China and its emerging one-man rule, and at the same time so thoroughly misunderstand America? Perhaps Mr. Soros will start supporting candidates who can unite America and help it prosper, so we can meet the challenge presented by China.<br />Marty Cummins<br />New Smyrna Beach, Fla.<br />We know Mr. Soros likes the idea of “open societies.” Who in the West doesn’t? But why is he assuming these cultures want to be remade in our image—like Nancy Pelosi, who thinks the Taliban cares that “the world is watching”?<br />Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party are no threat to the West. They know they’re gone if they don’t sustain “social harmony” for China’s new middle class. Treating the party as a great-power rival like the Soviet Union dignifies its inferior system and shows insecurity in our own. We can still service Chinese consumers without admiring their government. And we won’t spend Mr. Xi’s regime out of business like we did Mr. Gorbachev’s. We’ll only shore up Mr. Xi’s popularity at home."
