    "body": "An explosion ripped through a crowd of Afghans trying to enter Kabul airport Thursday, just as America’s allies said they were halting evacuation flights from Afghanistan, leaving behind citizens and thousands of Afghans who had been cleared for entry.<br />There were no immediate details on the extent of casualties, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said. A U.S. official said the attack happened at the airport’s Abbey Gate.<br />Western governments have repeatedly warned of an imminent attack by Islamic State and urged their citizens not to approach the airport on Thursday.<br />As the airlift opportunities began disappearing, desperate Afghans and foreign citizens still tried to reach Kabul’s international airport but on Thursday morning found the roads blocked by Taliban checkpoints.<br />“Everything is over,” said a 30-year-old teacher who tried to get to the airport. “They’re not letting anyone pass, not even those with foreign passports or visas.”"
