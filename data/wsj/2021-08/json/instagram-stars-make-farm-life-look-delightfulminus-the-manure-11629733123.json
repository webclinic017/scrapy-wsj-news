    "body": "Hannah Neeleman, a rancher and entrepreneur in Kamas, Utah, has found a following on social media for sunlit images of her rural life with her husband and six rosy-cheeked children.<br />The reigning Mrs. Utah and Juilliard-trained ballerina posts photos of dancing in the barn in cowboy boots; cooking on “Agnes,” her hunter-green Aga stove; and milking cows at dusk, all in support of the family’s Ballerina Farm brand, which includes an e-commerce site that sells meat as well as sundries like cute sweatshirts.<br />What doesn’t make the cut: expeditions the family makes to 7-Eleven for hot dogs when farm life inevitably gets too busy for a home-cooked meal. “I’m not sharing that, but we do it,” said Ms. Neeleman, who has over 200,000 followers on Instagram. “We do go get Slurpees occasionally.”<br />Ms. Neeleman and other creators of farming-lifestyle content are part of the rise of “farm-fluencers,” a social-media subculture devoted to portraying a bucolic vision of farm life. The result appears to be a charming, rustic dream. Reality is sometimes different. “I show the good, the bad, but not the ugly,” Ms. Neeleman said.<br />It can take some effort to keep jarring images of less appealing rural routines and modern life out of the frame."
