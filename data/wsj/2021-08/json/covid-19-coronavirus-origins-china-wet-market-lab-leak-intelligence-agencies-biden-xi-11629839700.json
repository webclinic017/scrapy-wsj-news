    "body": "If the U.S. intelligence agencies adhered to the mandated schedule, and there’s nothing magical about 90 days, the White House on Tuesday received spookdom’s report on the origins of Covid 19.<br />Leaks already indicate the 18 agencies couldn’t settle an internal disagreement over whether a natural origin or a lab release was more likely. There is much else they might usefully say, though, in the declassified release the administration has talked about making public in the next few days.<br />With 100% confidence, the agencies could certainly tell us that China has engaged in a deliberate coverup. With some degree of confidence, they might tell us whether they believe China itself knows how Covid got started.<br />The agencies could estimate how committed Xi Jinping and his regime are to the propaganda claim that the virus originated outside the country, perhaps in the U.S. Army facility at Fort Detrick, Md. They might tell us about China’s efforts to steal the secrets of the West’s superior vaccines.<br />On a related question, they could estimate how long China will stick with its zero-Covid policy, which has required a deepening, Mao-like control over its population and China’s re-isolation from the world."
