    "body": "After a decade of low growth and inflation, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell unveiled a new strategy a year ago in which the central bank would keep interest rates lower for longer.<br />Reality has dealt Mr. Powell a different and unexpected challenge: the biggest inflation spike in decades. Consumer prices rose 5.4% in July from a year earlier.<br />Mr. Powell heads into the Kansas City Fed’s annual conference this week at the center of the debate over how long the currently higher inflation will last, and what the Fed should do about it.<br />He is managing internal disagreement and weathering external criticism, with economic recovery thrown into renewed turmoil by the rise of the Delta variant.<br />Some central bank officials expect the recent price surges to reverse on their own, allowing the Fed to stick to the approach Mr. Powell outlined a year ago, intended to generate inflation slightly above 2%. Others see dangers that high inflation will persist, requiring the central bank to consider raising interest rates sooner or more aggressively than they had anticipated to force it down."
