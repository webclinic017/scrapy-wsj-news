    "body": "Powerful storm surges caused by Hurricane Ida could cause billions of dollars in insured losses across Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi, firms estimate.<br />Wells Fargo and Fitch Ratings analysts both have estimated the damages could total $15 billion to $20 billion. In comparison, Hurricane Katrina, which struck Louisiana 16 years to the day before Ida, caused a record $65 billion in insured losses, according to Fitch.<br />Catastrophe-modeling firms AIR Worldwide and RMS said they didn’t yet have estimates for insured losses stemming from Ida.<br />Responding to the devastation from Ida, insurer  Allstate  said it had set up multiple mobile claim centers in Alabama and Texas and had personnel ready to move in to assess damages as soon as it was possible for them to do so.<br />“We’re out of the way, safe, but close enough to quickly get to our customers and heavily damaged communities as soon as Ida moves out,” said Jerry Samson, senior manager of response for Allstate’s national catastrophe team, in a statement."
