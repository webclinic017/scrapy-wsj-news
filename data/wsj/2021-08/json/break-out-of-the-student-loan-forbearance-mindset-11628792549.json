    "body": "Regarding “Student Loan Forbearance—Forever?” (Review & Outlook, Aug. 9): The push to forgive student-loan debt promotes the wrong ideals. My sister and I were fortunate to obtain four-year degrees and graduate without student-loan debt. We could do so because it was our father’s goal to fund our educations.<br />My dad was a steelworker. He worked hard to achieve his goal, and sacrificed along the way. He raised his hand to work overtime every chance he got. He purchased run-down homes, repaired them himself and rented to those in need. We did not live in a fancy home, nor did he wear nice clothes. We were one of the last families I knew to get a VCR. One of my fondest childhood memories is attending the local auto auction where my dad bought cars.<br />It’s unfortunate that politicians today fail to promote the stories of people like my dad—stories of goals, sacrifice and achievement. Instead, they promote poor decision-making and offer handouts as remedies. When I am called “privileged” today, I nod and agree. I’m privileged to have my dad and the ideals he espoused.<br />Archie Johnson<br />Amherst, Ohio"
