    "body": "New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women during his time in office in violation of state and federal law and created a “climate of fear” in his administration, state Attorney General Letitia James said in a long-anticipated report Tuesday.<br />Ms. James said outside investigators uncovered conduct that was “deeply disturbing” and often involved younger women. The report largely confirms previously reported accusations by current and former state employees who said Mr. Cuomo sexually harassed them or acted inappropriately in the workplace, but it also includes several whose accounts haven’t previously been reported.<br />President Biden said Mr. Cuomo should resign, joining renewed calls from Republicans and some Democrats for the third-term Democratic governor  to step down. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) also called on Mr. Cuomo to resign, citing the completion of the report.<br />In at least one case, the 165-page report released Tuesday said Mr. Cuomo and his staff retaliated against a former adviser after she publicly aired allegations of sexual harassment last year.<br />“This investigation has revealed conduct that corrodes the very fabric and character of our state government,” Ms. James said at a news conference."
