    "body": "U.S. stock futures ticked down Wednesday ahead of the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July policy meeting.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 slid 0.1%, indicating that broader market may post a tepid decline at the opening bell. The index fell 0.7% on Tuesday in its biggest drop in nearly a month.<br />Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures edged down 0.3%, and contracts tied to the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 wavered between gains and losses.<br />The notes from the Fed meeting, due at 2 p.m. ET, will offer more indications of when the central bank may begin scaling back easy-money policies that were adopted at the start of the pandemic. Fed officials are nearing consensus on beginning to taper bond purchases in about three months, The Wall Street Journal reported this week. The Fed’s bond-buying program and lower interest rates have helped the stock market power higher, with major indexes notching records earlier this week.<br />“As long as policy remains reasonably supportive, growth continues and we keep increasing our vaccination, it is a strange environment where conditions are good for equities,” said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros. “There is genuine economic strength.”"
