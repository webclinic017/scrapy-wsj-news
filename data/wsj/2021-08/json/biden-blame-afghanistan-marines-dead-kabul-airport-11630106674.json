    "body": "“The Kabul Airport Massacre” (Review & Outlook, Aug. 27) is a tragedy resulting from incompetence. “The buck stops with me,” President Biden read from the teleprompter at his press conference, and then he promptly blamed everyone else for his mistakes. He blamed former President Trump for making a deal with the Taliban that resulted in no U.S. casualties for 18 months. Mr. Biden didn’t explain why he chose not to overturn such a bad deal while overturning so many of his predecessor’s other initiatives.<br />Mr. Biden blamed his generals for recommending that we abandon Bagram Air Base in favor of the insecure Kabul airport. If that’s true, then the generals responsible should be fired immediately.<br />He blamed U.S. citizens stranded in Afghanistan for not wanting to leave. It might be safer for them to stay rather than risk getting killed on the way to the airport.<br />He blames ISIS for the killings and threatens to track down and kill its members, but he trusts the Taliban to act as TSA agents providing safe passage to the airport. Maybe he forgot that Islamic terrorists, no matter how they are labeled, are committed to killing Americans.<br />Ultimately, voters are to blame for electing this president. America deserves better."
