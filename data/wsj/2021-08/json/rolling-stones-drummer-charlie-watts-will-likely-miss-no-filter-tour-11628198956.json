    "body": "Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts is unlikely to perform with his bandmates when they resume their “No Filter”  tour, as he recovers from a medical issue, the band shared in a statement.<br />Mr. Watts, 80 underwent a “completely successful” procedure and doctors advised him to find more time to rest and recover, the band shared in a statement Thursday. It didn’t identify the medical issue.<br />“For once my timing has been a little off,” Mr. Watts said in the statement. “I am working hard to get fully fit but I have today accepted on the advice of the experts that this will take a while.”<br />Mr. Watts hasn’t missed a show since joining the band in 1963, according to Rolling Stone magazine. He underwent treatment for throat cancer in 2004.<br />Drummer Steve Jordan, who has collaborated with Keith Richards and played in the band for “Late Night With David Letterman,” will take Mr. Watts’ place on tour."
