    "body": "SYDNEY— BHP Group Ltd. , the world’s biggest mining company, said it is considering the sale of its petroleum business, a move that would reduce its exposure to fossil fuels amid growing pressure from investors and governments for resources companies to cut emissions.<br />BHP said it is in talks with Australian oil-and-natural-gas company  Woodside Petroleum Ltd.  on a potential deal to combine BHP’s petroleum unit with Woodside.<br />BHP is also assessing other options for the division as part of a strategic review, the company said, without elaborating.<br />Analysts estimate the petroleum business has a value of at least $15 billion, and a deal is being explored while BHP separately hunts for a buyer for its thermal-coal mining business.<br />Selling the petroleum business would lead to BHP focusing on mined commodities, which include iron ore, metallurgical coal, copper, nickel and potentially potash if it proceeds with a large Canadian project. Of these commodities, iron ore accounts for the largest share of BHP’s profits."
