    "body": "BEIRUT—Demonstrations against Lebanon’s political elite are set to be held on Wednesday as civil-society groups demand justice for the deadly explosion in Beirut a year ago, which they blame on their leaders.<br />An investigation into the port blast on Aug. 4 last year has so far failed to provide accountability for one of the biggest nonnuclear explosions in history. The explosion killed more than 200 people, injured some 7,000 and devastated some of the Lebanese capital’s liveliest residential and commercial areas.<br />Activists accuse the ruling class of obstructing the investigation, which has led to more than two dozen arrests but not of any ministers or senior officials, many of whom are protected by immunity that Parliament has refused to lift.<br />Mada, a secular political group, called for people to gather at one of the neighborhoods devastated by the blast at 3:30 p.m. local time. “Justice for the victims, revenge against the regime,” the group said in an Arabic Instagram post.<br />Paul Naggear, whose 3-year-old daughter was killed in the explosion, urged people to come out and protest against the political establishment. “We all have suffered,” he said. “This is a day of solidarity.”"
