    "body": "The New York state Assembly said it would suspend its impeachment investigation of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, days after the three-term governor said he would resign.<br />Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, a Democrat, said Friday that the investigation’s purpose was to determine whether Mr. Cuomo should remain in office.<br />“The governor’s resignation answers that directive,” Mr. Heastie said, adding that the state’s constitution doesn’t allow the legislature to impeach and remove an elected official who is no longer in office. An impeachment trial could have led to a finding that barred Mr. Cuomo from holding statewide office in the future.<br />The Assembly had been looking into sexual-harassment allegations against Mr. Cuomo as well as alleged misuse of state resources in publishing a pandemic memoir and the misleading disclosure of Covid-19 nursing home data.<br />“This evidence, we believe, could likely have resulted in articles of impeachment had he not resigned,” said Mr. Heastie."
