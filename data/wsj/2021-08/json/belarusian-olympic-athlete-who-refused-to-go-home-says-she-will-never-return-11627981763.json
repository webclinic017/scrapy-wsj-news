    "body": "TOKYO—The Belarusian sprinter who refused her team’s orders to fly home after a public dispute said she would never return home for fear for her life and is looking to continue her sporting career—and perhaps reach another Olympics—in another country.<br />In her first full press interview since the incident, Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, who received a Polish humanitarian visa on Monday, said her husband fled Belarus for neighboring Ukraine and they plan to meet up in Poland. Ms. Tsimanouskaya plans to fly to Warsaw as soon as Wednesday.<br />“I was just afraid for my life, afraid to go to jail,” Ms. Tsimanouskaya said. “I don’t think I can ever go back to Belarus.”<br />On Sunday, members of the Belarusian team in Tokyo took Ms. Tsimanouskaya to the airport in an attempt to send her home against her will after she publicly criticized the country’s national Olympic coaches. Ms. Tsimanouskaya didn’t board the flight and appealed to the International Olympic Committee for help.<br />Ms. Tsimanouskaya said she was looking to continue her athletic career abroad and despite the setback in Tokyo is looking ahead to the next Summer Olympics: Paris 2024."
