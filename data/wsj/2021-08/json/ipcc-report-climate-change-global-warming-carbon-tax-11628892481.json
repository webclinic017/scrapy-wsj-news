    "body": "Your editorial “A Climate of Catastrophe” (Aug. 10) argues that the newest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate report isn’t as disturbing as one might imagine. You note the report’s estimate of likely climate-sensitivity range: 2.5 to 4 degrees Celsius higher than in the late 1800s, to be compared with a corresponding range reported in the IPCC’s 2013 report: 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius. You say the top end has been moderated, but I’d add that the bottom end has been shortened. A temperature rise as low as between 1.5 and 2.5 degrees is now in the unlikely range, per the IPCC. That’s very significant. The center of the likely range rises. The new IPCC report is not to be taken lightly.<br />Riley Newman<br />Irvine, Calif.<br /><br />Holman Jenkins makes a great point in “Same Climate Report, Different Day” (Business World, Aug. 11). If progressives really believed climate change is the existential threat they say it is, they would entertain a deal that couples a carbon tax with pro-growth tax relief. This could reduce emissions while providing income-tax relief and avoiding a net tax hike."
