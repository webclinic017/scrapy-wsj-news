    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court is officially on summer break, but you would be forgiven for thinking otherwise.<br />Already in August, the court loosened New York’s eviction moratorium, cleared Indiana University to proceed with a Covid-19 vaccine mandate for the fall semester, and reinstated a Trump-era policy that requires asylum seekers at the southern U.S. border to wait in Mexico while their claims are evaluated. The court also is considering whether to lift a federal public-health ban on evictions.<br />Welcome to what court watchers have deemed the “shadow docket” of the Supreme Court, where the justices throughout the year entertain emergency applications seeking their intervention. Here’s how this process works.<br />The high court hears about 70 cases a year, and there are clear and transparent procedures for deciding them. But the justices also make other types of decisions behind the scenes, including on emergency appeals. The shadow docket is an informal name for that body of work.<br />The court’s rules allow for the filing of emergency requests by litigants who believe they have been seriously wronged by a lower court. Those requests seek immediate—and in theory, temporary—high-court relief while a case continues."
