    "body": "BERLIN—Germany’s Green Party wants to overhaul the economic, foreign and climate policies of the continent’s largest economy in a political realignment that could have a profound impact on the European Union and potentially harden Germany’s stance toward China and Russia.<br />According to opinion polls, the Greens are likely to be part of the next ruling coalition after this autumn’s general election—for the first time since 2005—and could even lead it.<br />With their roots in an unruly 1970s alliance of environmentalists, leftists and pacifists, the Greens have developed into an established party with strong support among high-income city dwellers and poll ratings of around 20%. This makes them the second-biggest party after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives.<br />Their agenda goes beyond measures to fight climate change and would break long-established German policy taboos surrounding public debt and fiscal integration in Europe while aligning foreign policy closer with that of the U.S.<br />The party is calling for 50 billion euros a year, equivalent to $58.7 billion, in green investments, largely funded by public borrowing. That would almost certainly clash with the strict balanced-budget rules enshrined in Germany’s constitution."
