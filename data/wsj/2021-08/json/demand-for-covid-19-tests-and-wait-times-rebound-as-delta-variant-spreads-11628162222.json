    "body": "More Americans are being tested for Covid-19—and waiting longer for results—as virus cases surge and places from offices to concert venues require people to show proof they aren’t infected.<br />The nation’s Covid-19 testing infrastructure, from health systems and pharmacies to diagnostic labs, are racing to keep up as the highly contagious Delta variant spreads in many parts of the country. Workplace testing requirements and revised federal guidelines recommending that vaccinated people exposed to Covid-19 get tested could be adding to the demand.<br />Delayed results can hamper efforts to contain the spread of the virus and interfere with attendance at work, school or other activities that require proof of a negative test. Testing shortages and logjams complicated efforts to contain Covid-19 surges last year.<br />CVS Health Corp.  said Wednesday that demand for testing at its locations is now well above daily averages for this year. Meanwhile, at-home tests are among the company’s top-selling products in stores.<br />“People are obviously feeling symptoms and getting tested in greater numbers,” CVS Chief Executive Karen Lynch said in an interview. She said CVS has ample capacity to handle demand."
