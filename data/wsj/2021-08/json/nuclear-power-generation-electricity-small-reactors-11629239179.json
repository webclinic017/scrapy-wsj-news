    "body": "Far from merely being “shrunken nuclear reactors” with a smaller physical footprint, generation facilities will use advanced technology to operate at very low atmospheric pressure and use fuel and facility design that will be primarily “walkaway” safe (“Utilities Explore Mini Reactors,” Business News, Aug. 3). This is a tremendous step forward with small modular reactor (SMR) engineering that relies on gravity and other passive methods to ensure these generators cannot become dangerously overheated.<br />Energy sources that are emission-free, safe and reliable are increasingly popular. Recent polling data from Quest Global Research shows that 76% of Americans strongly or somewhat strongly favor the use of nuclear energy as one way to provide electricity. Organizations that support many of the carbon-reduction goals being proposed and adopted increasingly recognize that without clean nuclear these goals cannot be met.<br />Meanwhile, SMR designs can be portably deployed rapidly into areas that suffer catastrophic power loss as happened not long ago in Puerto Rico. Ultimately, nuclear innovations also will deliver power to many of the estimated two billion people in the world who currently have no access to electricity. New nuclear is clearly the way to a cleaner future.<br />C. H. “Bud” Albright<br />United States Nuclear Industry Council"
