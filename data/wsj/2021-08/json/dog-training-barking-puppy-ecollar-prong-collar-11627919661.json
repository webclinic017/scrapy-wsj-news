    "body": "The sticky note on the door jamb did us in. “Your dog has been barking since 10:55 a.m. I can hear it through the walls.” My wife and I had taken a short trip to the grocery store and left our Irish setter, Charley, alone in her cage. She barked wildly in our absence.<br />Charley’s bad behavior has added a lot of stress to our lives. By the time the note appeared, we were sick of being pulled down the street during walks and barked at during video calls. Dogs are fun to have and dote on, but we weren’t enjoying ours much, especially because we felt we couldn’t leave her alone.<br />So we went nuclear. We bought a prong collar and an e-collar, considered forbidden tools by most dog trainers and pet lovers.<br />People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals’ description of the prong collar captures the popular sentiment: “Prong collars are designed to punish dogs for pulling by inflicting pain and discomfort. They can cause serious physical and emotional damage to dogs and should never be used.”<br />In practice, the prongs tighten around the dog’s neck when they pull at the leash, giving the animal a clear incentive to walk by your side. If it really hurt, my dog, who is a bit of a sissy despite being an athletic 45 pounds, would yelp. She hasn’t yet."
