    "body": "City authorities in Kenosha, Wis., are being sued by the parents of a man allegedly shot and killed by Kyle Rittenhouse last year.<br />The family of Anthony Huber allege that the police and sheriff’s departments emboldened those protesting on the side of law enforcement, including Mr. Rittenhouse, against protesters on the opposing side.<br />Kenosha, about 30 miles south of Milwaukee, became a flashpoint last summer after Jacob Blake, a Black man, was shot repeatedly by a white Kenosha police officer in late August.<br />“The police are supposed to serve and protect but that’s not what the Kenosha police did,” Anthony’s father, John Huber, said in a statement. “If they had done their job, my son would still be alive today.”<br />An attorney representing Kenosha County and County Sheriff David Beth said they weren’t responsible for Mr. Huber’s death."
