    "body": "Thank you, Nolan Peterson, for your op-ed “Afghans Developed a Taste for Freedom” (Aug. 27). As the mother of a Marine who spent time in Afghanistan, my overwhelming reaction to the debacle in Kabul is depthless sorrow for the families of the 13 Americans killed Thursday. But I’ve also been trying to make sense of the 20 years of sacrifices Americans have made for the Afghan people.<br />Mr. Peterson doesn’t specifically mention the women of Afghanistan, but they are the ones I cannot stop thinking about. There are so many who know no other way of life than that of the past 20 years. They won’t forget what it is like to go to school, to show their faces, to have a career. Either they will find a way out or they will fight for freedoms lost. They won’t forget. I hope they also won’t forget the sacrifices Americans have made. These weren’t in vain. Planting the seeds of desire for freedom is one of the most noble actions humans are capable of doing.<br />Elizabeth Eaton Doyle<br />Sandia Park, N.M.<br />"
