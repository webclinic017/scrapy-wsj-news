    "body": "Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Sean Patrick Maloney was extraordinarily self-assured in an Aug. 2 NPR podcast. When asked whether Democrats will “lose their majority” next year, the New York congressman responded emphatically, “No, of course not.”<br />Democrats will retain control of the House, he reasons, because “we’re going to rebuild our country” with President Biden’s $3.5 trillion American Jobs Plan. This spending package includes climate initiatives like bigger subsidies for electric-car buyers and huge investments in so-called human infrastructure such as child care, universal pre-K, and community college—all free.<br />“We’re making a bet on substance,” Mr. Maloney said. Democrats are “going to build the future.”<br />He dismissed concerns about GOP influence over redistricting, saying if Republicans try “rigging this game,” then “well, I think that makes me proud to be a Democrat.” He was all confidence and verve, if a little smarmy.<br />It was an act. Politico later revealed that in a closed-door lunch the previous week, Mr. Maloney shared polling with colleagues showing Democrats behind Republicans by 6 points in generic ballot tests in battleground districts. If the midterms were today, he warned, Democrats would lose the majority."
