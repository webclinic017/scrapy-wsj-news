    "body": "Madonna and her original music label, Warner Music Group, are teaming up again in a deal that spans her entire recorded music catalog, and will include reissued albums and new deluxe editions curated by the performer over the next few years.<br />The agreement will start in 2022, on the 40th anniversary of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame entertainer’s 1982 debut.<br />\"Since the very beginning, Warner Music Group has helped bring my music and vision to all my fans around the world with the utmost care and consideration,” Madonna said in a statement announcing the partnership. “I am delighted to be embarking on this next chapter with them.”<br />Madonna began her mainstream career with Warner. In 2007, she joined concert-promotion giant  Live Nation Inc.,  in a deal that merged music recording and touring.<br />The new partnership, announced on the singer’s 63rd birthday, encompasses the performer’s entire catalog, including albums such as “Madonna,” “Like a Virgin” and “Like a Prayer.” Madonna’s three most recent studio albums, which were recorded during her time with Interscope Records, will also join the Warner catalog in 2025."
