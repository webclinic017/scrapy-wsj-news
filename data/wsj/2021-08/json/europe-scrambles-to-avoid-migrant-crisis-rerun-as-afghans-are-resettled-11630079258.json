    "body": "BERLIN—European governments are pushing to keep the doors open for people trying to flee Afghanistan while preventing a mass of refugees reaching Europe as the U.S.-led evacuation winds down.<br />A European plan initiated by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron would potentially combine billions of euros in funding for Afghanistan and its neighbors to help cater for refugees and internally displaced people, with measures aimed at securing Europe’s borders and cracking down on smugglers, according to officials and documents seen by The Wall Street Journal.<br />The proposal, to be put to other European Union members for approval on Tuesday, seeks to calibrate the need to protect those Afghans vulnerable to persecution under Taliban regime with the desire to pre-empt a repeat of the 2015-16 refugee crisis in Europe, when more than two million asylum seekers streamed into the bloc.<br />EU officials are holding talks with Taliban leaders to ensure any EU funding finds its way to those people displaced by the movement’s rapid advances in recent weeks so as to prevent a mass-scale exodus from the country, according to officials and confidential documents seen by the Journal.<br />The officials are also negotiating with Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, Qatar and Turkey for those countries to help manage the potential outpouring of refugees."
