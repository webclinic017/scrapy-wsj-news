    "body": "Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster—a man deeply implicated in America’s two-decade, $2 trillion failure in Afghanistan—decries, along with co-author Bradley Bowman, President Biden’s decision to end the misguided U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan (“In Afghanistan, the Tragic Toll of Delusion, op-ed,” Aug. 16).<br />Mr. McMaster reiterates the same argument we’ve heard for 20 years: Success in Afghanistan beckons just over the horizon if America continues to expend precious lives and resources to achieve it. But the Taliban’s swift takeover gives the lie to this claim; nation-building at the barrel of a gun doesn’t work, no matter the time or trillions we invest.<br />Mr. Biden has made a necessary decision to recognize our Afghanistan policy for the failure it is, and to refuse to kick the can down the road any longer. He issued an important challenge to those arguing for indefinite military engagement with ill-defined prospects: “How many more lives, American lives, is it worth?”<br />I would be curious to hear Mr. McMaster’s answer.<br />Andrew Bacevich"
