    "body": "SEOUL—Imprisoned for the past seven months,  Samsung ’s  de facto leader Lee Jae-yong walked free, after South Korea’s justice ministry pointed to the national economy in granting him parole earlier this week.<br />He was released roughly a year early from a 30-month sentence for bribing South Korea’s ex-president. As he left a detention center near Seoul on Friday, Mr. Lee, wearing a gray suit and a face mask, apologized to the nation. “I am well aware of all the worry, criticism, concern and expectations I face,” said the 53-year-old grandson of Samsung’s founder.<br />Now, he has to prove his reprieve was justified.<br />When Mr. Lee was in prison, his supporters argue, Samsung delayed big investments, avoided major acquisitions and lacked strategic direction. So goes life for the head of a dynastic South Korean conglomerate where power largely centers around a single ruling family member.<br />His to-do list is significant. Samsung needs to still make final calls on where to build U.S. factories for chips and electric-vehicle batteries. Its biopharmaceuticals production unit needs to land more contracts to become a bigger player in global Covid-19 vaccine production. Extra spending is necessary to gain ground in the chip-foundry sector, semiconductor-industry experts say."
