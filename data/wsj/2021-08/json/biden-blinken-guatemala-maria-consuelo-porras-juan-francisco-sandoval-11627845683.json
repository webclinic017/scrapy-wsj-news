    "body": "The State Department is sowing trouble again in Guatemala. If Foggy Bottom gets its wish, political instability is likely to increase in Central America, and migration pressures at the southern U.S. border will get worse.<br />At issue is the firing, with cause, of a Guatemalan prosecutor. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has condemned the decision and suspended U.S. cooperation with the attorney general’s office as punishment.<br />No secretary of state can know the political landscape in every country. Mr. Blinken has to rely on his bureaucracy. Unfortunately, it has misled him on this matter. He is endorsing behavior that is harmful to U.S. interests.<br />Guatemala is rife with corruption. Trafficking of drugs and human beings, extortion, graft, bribery and crony capitalism are only a few of the challenges it faces.<br />Fighting endemic lawlessness requires democratic institutions. That’s a long-term project but it starts with a commitment to judicial independence and the constitution. Without greater transparency and accountability, corruption will persist."
