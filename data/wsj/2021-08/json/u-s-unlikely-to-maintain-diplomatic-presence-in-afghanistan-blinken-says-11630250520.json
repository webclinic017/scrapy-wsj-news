    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. said it launched a drone strike targeting suspected suicide bombers near the Kabul airport Sunday as America’s 20-year war there wound down to its final hours.<br />The drone strike was the second such attack following the explosion that killed 13 U.S. service members and more than 200 Afghan civilians at the Hamid Karzai International Airport last week. It came as the U.S. scrambled to have its military and diplomatic personnel out of the country by Tuesday, the deadline previously agreed upon by the Taliban before it would take control of the airport in Kabul.<br />The drone took aim at a vehicle carrying suspected suicide bombers, the Pentagon said. The U.S. believed it successfully struck the vehicle, but couldn’t say how many bombers were hit.<br />The initial battlefield assessment concluded that no civilians had been killed, the military official said.<br />The Biden administration said it remained committed to Afghanistan after Tuesday’s final withdrawal, even as the U.S. presence faded fast amid mounting security concerns."
