    "body": "The historic wave of protests in Cuba last month against the communist regime has triggered a political battle in Florida to define the Biden administration’s response, with Democrats hoping to avoid further losses among Latino voters in the electorally crucial state.<br />Thousands of people poured into Cuba’s streets last month to protest deteriorating living conditions, and the government responded by cracking down, deploying security forces who arrested and attacked the protesters. So far, police have arrested about 770 people, of whom 555 are still detained, according to Cubalex, a human-rights group. Many have undergone summary trials on charges such as public disorder and have been sentenced to prison terms of up to a year. A number of those sentenced have been allowed to serve their terms under house arrest.<br />President Biden, after being accused by Republicans and some Democrats of being slow to react, imposed sanctions on Cuban officials and is promising additional action, including ways to expand internet access to people on the island.<br />Republicans say he needs to be more aggressive and point to comments from progressives in Washington placing some blame on the decadeslong U.S. embargo.<br />“The problem is his party is controlled by the radical left that won’t even call out the Cuban regime. They’re making my life easier,” said Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, who heads the GOP’s Senate election arm."
