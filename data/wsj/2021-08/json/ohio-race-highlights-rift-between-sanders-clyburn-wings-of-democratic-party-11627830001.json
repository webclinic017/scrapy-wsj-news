    "body": "A House special election primary in Cleveland on Tuesday is shaping up as a proxy war over the direction of the Democratic Party, with the top two candidates drawing millions in donations as prominent figures including Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. James Clyburn line up on opposing sides.<br />Nina Turner, a top surrogate for Mr. Sanders (I., Vt.) during his presidential campaigns, has long been the front-runner in the race, which includes 13 candidates. The former state senator, 53 years old, who backs liberal plans including Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, has raised $5.6 million since announcing her candidacy, according to her campaign.<br />Her top rival, Cuyahoga County Councilwoman Shontel Brown, 46, has proved tough competition. She has raised $2.4 million, according to her campaign, and drawn the support of not only Mr. Clyburn, the powerful House Democratic whip from South Carolina, but also former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who defeated Mr. Sanders in the 2016 presidential primary.<br />Ms. Brown has said she would support Medicare for All and a Green New Deal if they came up for a vote, but she also would back more gradual approaches.<br />Tuesday’s primary will determine the Democratic nominee for the special election Nov. 2 to fill the seat vacated by Marcia Fudge, who left Congress earlier this year to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The district which includes Cleveland, its eastern suburbs and part of Akron, is solidly Democratic and whoever wins the primary this week is expected to prevail in the fall."
