    "body": "WASHINGTON—Former President Donald Trump won’t sue to block former Justice Department officials from testifying before two congressional committees investigating his administration’s efforts to overturn President Biden’s victory, his lawyer said in a letter this week.<br />Mr. Trump’s stance clears the way for the former officials to begin speaking with lawmakers behind closed doors as soon as this week, including about their private conversations with the former president, a person familiar with the process said.<br />While Mr. Trump won’t launch a challenge to keep the six former Justice Department officials from testifying, he could take legal action if congressional investigators decide to seek “privileged information” from any other Trump administration officials or advisers, according to his lawyer Doug Collins, a former Republican U.S. representative from Georgia.<br />“If the Committees do seek such information, however, we will take all necessary and appropriate steps, on President Trump’s behalf, to defend the Office of the Presidency,” Mr. Collins said in letters to former officials including then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, his deputy, Richard Donoghue, and two former U.S. attorneys in Georgia whom Mr. Trump pressed to investigate his unsupported claims of voter fraud.<br />The Biden Justice Department opened the path for their testimony when it said it would make a rare exception to longstanding practice against officials speaking publicly about confidential internal deliberations and allow them to provide information to the House Oversight and Reform and Senate Judiciary committees. The panels are examining the Trump administration’s efforts in its final days to undo Mr. Biden’s win."
