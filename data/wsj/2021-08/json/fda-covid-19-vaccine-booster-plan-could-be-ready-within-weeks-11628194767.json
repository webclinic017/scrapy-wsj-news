    "body": "The Food and Drug Administration expects to have a strategy on Covid-19 vaccine boosters by early September that would lay out when and which vaccinated individuals should get the follow-up shots, according to people familiar with discussions within the agency.<br />The Biden administration is pushing for the swift release of a booster strategy because some populations—people age 65 or older and people who are immunocompromised, as well as those who got the shots in December or January shortly after they were rolled out—could need boosters as soon as this month, two of the people said.<br />Any booster strategy from the U.S. government will need to address declining protection for certain people at a time when vaccines remain in short supply in the developing world.<br />About half of the country has been fully vaccinated, or 165 million people, federal data show.<br />Research shows that the authorized vaccines offer effective protection against symptomatic Covid-19 for at least six months. But the protection diminishes over time, leading some public-health experts and vaccine makers to believe that boosters are necessary to maintain protection. A growing body of evidence suggests the vaccines are less effective among people with weakened immune systems than among the general population."
