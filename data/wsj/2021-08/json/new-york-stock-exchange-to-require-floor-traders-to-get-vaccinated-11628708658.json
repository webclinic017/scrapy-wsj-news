    "body": "The New York Stock Exchange will require traders to be vaccinated against Covid-19 to access its historic trading floor, stepping up its measures against the coronavirus amid rising cases of the Delta variant.<br />Traders and other personnel who work on the floor will need to be fully vaccinated by Sept. 13, unless they qualify for a medical or religious exemption, NYSE Chief Operating Officer Michael Blaugrund said in a Wednesday email to the exchange’s floor community.<br />Those who are granted medical or religious exemptions will need to be masked and present recent negative Covid-19 tests before accessing the floor, Mr. Blaugrund wrote in the email, a copy of which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />The memo cited “recent shifts in public health conditions as well as updated recommendations from federal, state and local authorities.” NYSE is also expanding its on-site random testing program to include vaccinated personnel, effective immediately, the memo said.<br />The NYSE’s total floor population numbers several hundred people, including traders, exchange employees and technology vendors. During the heyday of in-person stock trading in the early 2000s, thousands crowded onto the floor on weekdays, but the rise of electronic trading since then has decimated staffing levels."
