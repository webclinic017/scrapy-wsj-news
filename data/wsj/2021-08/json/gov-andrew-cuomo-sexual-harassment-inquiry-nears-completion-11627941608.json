    "body": "The New York state attorney general’s investigation into sexual-harassment allegations against Gov. Andrew Cuomo has entered its final stages and is expected to wrap up this month, people familiar with the inquiry said.<br />Investigators questioned the Democratic governor in his Manhattan office on July 17, and have since conducted follow-up interviews with at least two of his accusers, some of the people said. Last week, several outside attorneys working on the attorney general’s probe toured the Executive Mansion and the governor’s office suite at the state Capitol—the sites of some of the alleged harassment under investigation, two of the people said.<br />Mr. Cuomo requested the investigation in March after two former aides said he sexually harassed them in the workplace. Other women subsequently made accusations, including a current employee who said the governor groped her breast during an encounter at the Mansion—an accusation that Mr. Cuomo has denied.<br />Mr. Cuomo has denied he touched anybody inappropriately and apologized if his behavior made anybody uncomfortable.<br />High-level Democrats have joined Republicans in calling for Mr. Cuomo to step down, but he has remained in office, arguing that he should be afforded due process by the investigation. The findings of the probe are likely to revive debate about Mr. Cuomo’s ability to continue in office and to affect his expected bid for a fourth term next year. They will also be considered as part of a broader impeachment investigation being conducted by the New York state Assembly, lawmakers said."
