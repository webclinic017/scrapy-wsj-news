    "body": "More than a few European economists have claimed for years that the Continent needs more inflation to cure the eurozone’s many ills, and now they’ve got it. Data released Tuesday showed the eurozone hitting its fastest rate of price rises in years, though we doubt it solves any problems.<br />The top-line inflation rate hit 3% year-on-year in August, up from 2.2% in July. The European Central Bank’s official target is 2% so, even under the somewhat more lax policy rule introduced this summer, someone in Frankfurt should be starting to worry. All the more so when you consider that, even excluding 15.4% energy-price inflation and 2.9% raw-food inflation, the “core” measure still clocked in at 1.6%—the fastest pace of price gains since 2012.<br />As in the U.S. and United Kingdom, the usual suspects are emerging to argue eurozone inflation will be transitory. For Europe, these allegedly temporary factors are a shortage of agricultural labor, surging demand for services such as tourism, a temporary German consumption-tax cut last year setting a deceptive baseline, and so on.<br />A political problem for ECB President Christine Lagarde is that inflation isn’t evenly distributed across the eurozone. Prices rose 4.7% in Belgium, 3.4% in inflation-hawk Germany, and 2.7% in the Netherlands—but a below-target 1.3% in Portugal and 1.2% in Greece. Inflation is supposed to help southern European economies devalue their way to prosperity on the sly, yet the economies that have inflation are those where it’s most politically toxic.<br />Then there’s Italy. An inflation rate of 2.6% is supposed to be good news for Rome, whose government debt now equals roughly 156% of GDP. Inflation is supposed to make that debt more manageable over time. That’s debatable, however, since faster price rises are likely to trigger higher interest rates that would strain Rome’s fisc."
