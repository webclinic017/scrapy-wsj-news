    "body": "Gerald Seib points out that the U.S. is fighting against both Covid-19 and an epidemic of mistrust (“Capital Journal: Divided We Stand Against Delta Threat,” U.S. News, Aug. 3). I believe the source of the distrust is former President Donald Trump’s strategy of attacking the motives and credibility of all who accuse him of misbehavior.<br />I have watched my Trump-supporting friends double down and add previously respected experts and institutions to the ever-expanding list of anti-Trump conspirators: the Justice Department, Internal Revenue Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Central Intelligence Agency, Robert Mueller, Jim Mattis, William Barr, Jeff Sessions and Anthony Fauci. The list goes on and on.<br />Far too many previously trusted institutions and individuals have been sullied, ridiculed and devalued to justify tolerating Mr. Trump’s behavior.<br />Skip Sacks<br />Norfolk, Va."
