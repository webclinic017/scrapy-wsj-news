    "body": "<br />Following a long yearof lockdowns and house arrest, Americans are on the move. Airplanes are full. People have hit the roads. Summer vacation has re-entered our national calendar.<br />Travel usually induces a sense of connection, but it may also enforce a feeling of aloneness. The paintings of Edward Hopper (1882-1967) are 20th-century embodiments of such isolation. His images of people, single or in small groups, represent what he called, in his description of the much reproduced “Nighthawks,” “the loneliness of a large city.”<br />That loneliness existed for Hopper everywhere, not just in cities: in small towns, countryside and seaside, even in more desolate areas.<br />Consider the 1957 “Western Motel” (roughly three by four feet) at the Yale University Art Gallery, a picture of a woman sitting on a bed, with suitcases visible at its foot and a parked car visible through the window behind her. It shares a wall with three equally great Hopper oils: “Rooms for Tourists,” “Sunlight in a Cafeteria,” and “Rooms by the Sea.”"
