    "body": "In “Will Biden Bring an End to Reagan’s Era of Prosperity?” (op-ed, Aug. 13), Arthur Laffer and Stephen Moore should note that President Ronald Reagan’s 1981 tax reforms were designed to be revenue-neutral. Broadening the tax base—by reducing the distortions in the tax structure that excluded almost half of income and capital gains—would capture revenue that would offset any decline caused by the reduction in tax rates. Federal tax revenue increased in every Reagan year except 1982.<br />The reforms, it’s important to remember, were passed by a heavily Democratic House. I am at a loss to explain why the Democratic Party now excoriates reforms that it helped pass, that were so successful and that demonstrated a bipartisan policy success.<br />Em.
