    "body": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday recommended administering additional messenger RNA vaccine doses to certain immunocompromised people.<br />The CDC took the step after its vaccination advisory panel voted to recommend the additional doses at a meeting Friday after reviewing clinical trial data and other relevant information. The vote by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, was 11-0.<br />The CDC recommends giving an additional dose of a Covid-19 vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and its partner  BioNTech SE  in moderately or severely immunocompromised people who are 12 years and older, or the vaccine from  Moderna Inc.  in the immunocompromised 18 years and older.<br />CDC Director Rochelle Walensky signed the advisory panel’s recommendation on Friday several hours after the vote, making it official policy.<br />“At a time when the Delta variant is surging, an additional vaccine dose for some people with weakened immune systems could help prevent serious and possibly life-threatening Covid-19 cases within this population,” she said."
