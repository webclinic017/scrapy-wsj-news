    "body": "The first detailed results of the 2020 census, scheduled for release Thursday, are expected to show a nation that is aging, diversifying and continuing to grow faster in the South and Southwest.<br />The decennial census data might also show that the total white population shrank for the first time in U.S. history, with all of the nation’s growth attributed to nonwhite residents.<br />Demographers will be watching to see whether the U.S. crossed several other benchmarks, including the possibility that the white population dropped below 60% for the first time and whether white people will fall below 50% of the population that is younger than 18 years old.<br />The census also has been expected to document the continued depopulation of rural areas as cities and their suburbs grow and gain political sway.<br />The first census results—consisting only of population totals for states and the nation—were released in late April. The U.S. population reached 331 million last year, growing more slowly over the last decade than at any time since the 1930s."
