    "body": "The remains of 13 service members killed in the suicide bombing in Afghanistan last week arrived at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Sunday, in a somber moment that highlighted the human toll of a nearly 20-year war nearing its tumultuous end.<br />President Biden participated in a dignified transfer ritual and met with families of the fallen troops, whose remains were carried off an aircraft in flag-draped transfer cases.<br />The 13 service members were remembered as brave and committed by those who knew them. Mr. Biden on Saturday called them “heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice in service of our highest American ideals and while saving the lives of others.”<br />Joining Mr. Biden was his wife, Jill Biden, and a large group of officials including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin; Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Gen. David Berger, the Marine Corps commandant; and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.<br />Eleven of the transfers were witnessed by reporters, with the two others conducted in privacy at request of family members. Sobbing was audible to reporters as the families looked on."
