    "body": "I was wrong. When President Biden was elected, I thought we finally had a leader who is respected in the world, one with the experience to keep America safe (“Biden’s Afghanistan Surrender,” Review & Outlook, Aug. 16). I also expected him to govern from the center, as he campaigned.<br />The misadventure in Afghanistan shows that he was more concerned about the political optics of getting the troops out by a certain date than planning a safe withdrawal. His miscalculation, which even I could foresee, could lead to American fatalities and certainly further Afghan suffering and deaths. We may also see a resurgence of Islamic terrorism. It’s so disappointing, tragic and avoidable.<br />Arthur L. Wisot<br />Rolling Hills Estates, Calif.<br />"
