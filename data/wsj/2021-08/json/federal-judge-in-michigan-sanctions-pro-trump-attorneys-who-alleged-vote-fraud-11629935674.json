    "body": "A federal judge sanctioned attorneys who sued Michigan officials alleging that widespread fraud denied former President Donald Trump the election there, saying that they presented claims without evidence and abused the judicial system.<br />“This case was never about fraud—it was about undermining the People’s faith in our democracy and debasing the judicial process to do so,” U.S. District Judge Linda Parker in Detroit said in a 110-page ruling on Wednesday.<br />Judge Parker, a 2014 Obama appointee, issued the punishment against Sidney Powell, L. Lin Wood and other attorneys who represented six Republican voters in the lawsuit.<br />“Despite the haze of confusion, commotion, and chaos counsel intentionally attempted to create by filing this lawsuit, one thing is perfectly clear: Plaintiffs’ attorneys have scorned their oath, flouted the rules, and attempted to undermine the integrity of the judiciary along the way,” Judge Parker wrote.<br />Ms. Powell and Mr. Wood didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment."
