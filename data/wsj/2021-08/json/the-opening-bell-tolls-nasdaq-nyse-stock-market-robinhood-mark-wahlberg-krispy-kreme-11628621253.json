    "body": "The IPO market is hotter than ever this summer—and so is competition for exchange-bell ringing privileges.<br />An initial public offering is the ultimate marketing event, and a glitzy bell-ringing ceremony an indispensable component. CEOs, employees and early investors line up on a podium, smile for the television cameras and press a button to ring the bell that heralds the start of trading. Cheers commence.<br />IPO activity so far in 2021 has already surpassed that of every full year on record, with more than 20 companies going public a week on average. That means there just aren’t enough bell-ringing opportunities to go around.<br />Companies are going to great lengths to achieve their bell-ringing dreams.<br />GXO Logistics Inc.,  which spun off from  XPO Logistics Inc.  earlier this month and manages supply chains for companies such as Apple Inc. and  Nike Inc.,  was able to secure a bell because its trading debut fell on a Monday, when few listings occur. But GXO’s  London-based Chief Executive Malcolm Wilson, keen as he was for bell-ringing honors, was unable to make it to New York due to Covid travel restrictions."
