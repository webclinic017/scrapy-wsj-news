    "body": "ALBANY, N.Y. —One of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s state aides filed a criminal complaint with the Albany County Sheriff’s Office alleging the Democratic governor groped her during an encounter at the Executive Mansion last year, the sheriff said.<br />Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple said the woman filed the complaint Thursday afternoon. She has said Mr. Cuomo, a 63-year-old Democrat, reached under her shirt and groped her breast over her bra after she was summoned to the mansion on Nov. 16 for a work assignment.<br />Brian Premo, an attorney for the woman, said her complaint involved the incident and other allegations of inappropriate touching by Mr. Cuomo that were outlined in a Tuesday report by Attorney General Letitia James. The woman is identified in the report as Executive Assistant #1, Mr. Premo said.<br />Mr. Cuomo and his lawyer, Rita Glavin, denied the incident happened.<br />The complaint raises the possibility that Mr. Cuomo could face criminal charges. The woman is the first accuser known to have filed a criminal complaint against the governor. Legal experts say that his alleged behavior could be charged as forcible touching, which is a misdemeanor."
