    "body": "Many exchange-traded funds that scored big on the meme-stock craze earlier this year are missing out on large gains this time around.<br />State Street ’s   had roughly one-fifth of its assets in  GameStop  earlier this year, helping it score a 37% return in January. But by August, GameStop shares represented less than 1% of the fund’s assets. So when the stock took flight again last week, rising nearly 30%, the ETF gained just 2%.<br />The results underscore the swirling dynamics facing fund managers and others at a time of outsize gains in a handful of red-hot stocks. While some ETFs that invested in these firms last year have continued to reap gains, others have retreated from the shares in a bid to reduce risk and ended up missing out on fresh windfalls, potentially pressuring performance.<br />“A lot of people say we’re capping the upside, but we’re also mitigating the downside of a single stock that could blow up your investment thesis,” said Matt Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors<br />State Street’s retail ETF, which trades under the ticker symbol XRT, offers a way for investors to bet on a swath of the retail sector, usually giving roughly equal exposure to GameStop as to the industry juggernaut,  Amazon.com Inc."
