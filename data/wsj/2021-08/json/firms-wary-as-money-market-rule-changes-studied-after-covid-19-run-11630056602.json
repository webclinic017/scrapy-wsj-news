    "body": "Investment managers are fighting for the future of money-market funds.<br />Just over a year ago, jittery investors withdrew from the markets over concern the pandemic would devastate the economy. Money funds emerged as a flashpoint in March 2020, when companies and pension managers raced to stockpile cash, and the firms that managed those funds struggled to sell enough bonds to meet those redemptions.<br />Now financial regulators are weighing rule changes designed to ensure that these funds fare better in the next crisis.<br />Asset managers have supported some of the regulators’ ideas, including one that might ensure higher-yielding prime money funds will weather future runs without the need for government support. Other proposals, they argue, would render many funds too costly to manage. They have made those opinions known in comment letters and meetings with Securities and Exchange Commission officials.<br />“I don’t think the SEC is in a seat where they want this industry to die a quick death or a slow and painful death,” said Debbie Cunningham, investment chief of global liquidity markets at  Federated Hermes Inc.,  adding that  many of the regulators’ ideas would accomplish one or the other. Officials at the SEC “realize that,” she said."
