    "body": "TEL AVIV—Early data from Israel suggests a booster shot of  Pfizer Inc.’s  Covid-19 vaccine can significantly improve immunity in those aged 60 and above, as the U.S. and other countries plan additional doses to increase protection against the highly infectious Delta variant.<br />Israel was one of the first countries late last month to authorize a third Pfizer dose for the elderly who were fully vaccinated with the recommended two shots, after indications that vaccine protection against severe illness has waned.<br />The booster shot reduced the risk of infection in the 60-plus age group by 86% and against severe infection by 92%, according to an observational study by Israel’s second largest healthcare provider, Maccabi Health Services, released Wednesday.<br />Both Pfizer and  Moderna Inc.  have said their own studies showed a booster shot would improve protection. The Maccabi findings are based on real-world data from a relatively large group, which could help inform other countries that are planning their own vaccine rollout strategies.<br />The Biden administration said Wednesday it was preparing to offer booster shots beginning the week of Sept. 20. U.S. health authorities said people 65 and older and individuals in chronic-care facilities are expected to get boosters initially. The program would eventually cover more than 155 million people in the country."
