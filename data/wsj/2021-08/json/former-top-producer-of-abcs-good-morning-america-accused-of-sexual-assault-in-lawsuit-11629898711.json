    "body": "An ABC News staffer filed a lawsuit Wednesday against Michael Corn, the former top producer of “Good Morning America,” alleging he sexually assaulted her and fostered a toxic work environment.<br />Kirstyn Crawford, a producer on the morning show, alleged that Mr. Corn assaulted her in 2015 during a business trip to Los Angeles, according to the suit, which was filed in New York state court.<br />The suit also alleges that former ABC News producer Jill McClain was sexually assaulted by Mr. Corn when the two worked at ABC’s “World News Tonight” roughly a decade ago. Ms. McClain isn’t a plaintiff in the suit, but is supporting Ms. Crawford’s case, according to the complaint.<br />The suit also names ABC, a unit of  Walt Disney Co. , as a defendant, alleging the company received complaints about Mr. Corn’s conduct from several women, going back roughly a decade, but failed to take disciplinary action.<br />ABC officials learned of Ms. Crawford’s allegations in 2017, but only launched an investigation into Mr. Corn’s conduct after Ms. Crawford and Ms. McClain filed formal complaints to the company in February of this year, according to the suit."
