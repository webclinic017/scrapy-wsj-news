    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration will begin outfitting some Border Patrol agents with body cameras, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Wednesday.<br />The move, which has been under discussion since the Obama administration, will for the first time require thousands of agents patrolling the border, as well as officers at ports of entry, to wear cameras the size of a deck of playing cards on the front of their uniforms. It will equip the Border Patrol with a new tool to investigate violent incidents and possible misconduct on the part of its agents.<br />Body cameras will first be rolled out along sections of the southern border in West Texas and New Mexico, according to two officials familiar with the plan. The government expects to outfit 6,000 agents with cameras by the end of this year.<br />In a statement, acting CBP Commissioner Troy Miller said the step is an attempt to improve accountability within the agency and build trust with the public.<br />“Providing [agents] with state-of-the-art technology and tools like body-worn cameras will support their work and provide greater transparency into interactions between CBP officers and agents and the public,” he said."
