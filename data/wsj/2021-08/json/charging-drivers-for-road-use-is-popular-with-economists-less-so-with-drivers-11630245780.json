    "body": "In 2003, London started charging drivers a fee to drive on the city center’s narrow streets. In the years since, studies have documented reduced traffic congestion, better bus service, fewer accidents and an improved overall quality of life.<br />Jonathan Leape, a professor at the London School of Economics, has called the system “a triumph of economics.”<br />The experiment has caught on. New York plans to implement a similar congestion charge south of 60th Street in Manhattan. San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle and other U.S. cities are considering it.<br />Economists have been promoting congestion charges for years, said Matthew Turner, an economist at Brown University, especially now that the widespread adoption of transponders and GPS systems has removed some of the technological obstacles.<br />“The technology has gotten better and we’ve gotten more experienced with it, so now it’s a pretty natural thing to do,” Mr. Turner said."
