    "body": "Countries like Australia, New Zealand and China have kept the coronavirus at bay with some of the harshest travel restrictions in the world, including banning most visitors and forcing returning citizens to quarantine.<br />Now, the emergence of the highly infectious Delta variant is prompting authorities to double down and sometimes expand those restrictions, taking a toll on expatriates who thought they could ride out the pandemic until it got easier to travel home.<br />Australia recently halved the number of international passengers it is allowing into the country on commercial flights so that its hotel-quarantine system wouldn’t be overwhelmed. A Delta outbreak there prompted New Zealand to suspend a quarantine-free travel bubble. And China recently mandated more stringent coronavirus testing for returned travelers.<br />“The Delta strain is a complete rule changer for everything,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said recently when asked about travel restrictions. “Everything we knew about Covid before has changed.”<br />Some people trying to return home to these fortress countries are resigned to not traveling anytime soon. Would-be travelers say airline tickets are expensive and that flights are frequently scrapped because of ever-changing government policies. Many said their stress levels are high."
