    "body": "Tesla chief Elon Musk was obliged to make an ignominious admission to the California Department of Motor Vehicles. What Tesla dubs its “Full Self Driving Capability,” and charges up to $10,000 for, is actually, in the jargon of the industry, a Level 2 driving aid. In other words, no different from what other car makers, from GM to  Kia ,  provide as an option or even standard equipment. It can steer and match traffic speed on the highway or in bumper-to-bumper situations. In no case, though, are you encouraged to take your hands off the wheel and eyes off the road.<br />Tesla’s Level 2 package also appears to fail disconcertingly at a basic autonomous vehicle job, performed in many cars by a radar array costing less than $200. It doesn’t reliably avoid collisions with stationary objects such as emergency vehicles. A federal investigation has opened and we can already anticipate its findings: Tesla’s implementation of Level 2 is as good as anybody’s; the problem is caused by Tesla owners believing their cars to be more advanced than they are."
