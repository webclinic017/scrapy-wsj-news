    "body": "As much as I respect Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, I must write in support of Prof. Ruth Wisse’s analysis of the disease we call antisemitism. Yes, antisemitism is a hatred like so many hatreds, but after combatting it for more than 50 years, I can assure you it is also, sadly, unique (“Anti-Semitism Isn’t Merely Another Kind of Hate,” op-ed, Aug. 9).<br />All the hatreds that Mr. Lapid cites single out specific targets: a group, a conflict, a war, a religion and ideology—and in most instances they are limited in time or geography. Antisemitism, the hatred of Jews, is timeless, universal and multipurpose. It serves many masters, many interests. It has continued to metastasize. It matters not what Jews do or do not, say or not say. Facts and truth are irrelevant, as long as the hatred of Jews serves the interests at hand—political, ideological, religious or commercial.<br />It was in the past when Jews were prohibited from doing things others were permitted to do. Today, it is the state of Israel that has become the Jew among the nations. It alone cannot be allowed to decide its capital or have the right to defend itself. And that is not just a hatred as all others.<br />Abe Foxman<br />Bergen County, N.J."
