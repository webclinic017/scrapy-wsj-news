    "body": "Covid-19 hospitalizations in Florida have reached a record high, federal data show, as the state battles a surge in cases brought on by the highly contagious Delta variant.<br />There were 11,515 confirmed Covid-19 hospitalizations in the state, according to data released Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.<br />The Delta-driven surge has hit a younger population than prior surges while filling hospital beds at a rapid clip, according to the Florida Hospital Association, which represents health centers in the state. The number of Covid-19 hospitalizations in Florida jumped from 2,000 to 10,000 in 30 days during this current surge, double the pace seen last summer, said Mary Mayhew, the association’s chief executive.<br />“This is putting 25-year-olds in the hospital, in intensive care and on ventilators,” Ms. Mayhew said.<br />She said the Delta surge is also coinciding with a surge in hospital visits for other reasons, including other respiratory infections and a catch-up effect from delayed care during the pandemic, adding to pressure on hospitals. She also noted that more than 90% of the people hospitalized for Covid-19 aren’t vaccinated."
