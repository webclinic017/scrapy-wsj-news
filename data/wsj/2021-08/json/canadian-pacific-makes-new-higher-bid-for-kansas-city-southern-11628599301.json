    "body": "Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd.  made a new, increased offer for  Kansas City Southern ,  reigniting a takeover battle with  Canadian National Railway Co.  for the highly coveted U.S. railroad.<br />Canadian Pacific said Tuesday it submitted a bid that values Kansas City Southern at $300 a share, or about $27 billion not including assumed debt.<br />The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that it was planning such a move.<br />Kansas City Southern is the smallest of the major freight railroads in the U.S. The company plays a big role in U.S.-Mexico trade, with a network stretching across both countries, helping explain its desirability as an acquisition target. Railroad takeovers are rare as regulators tend to view them with a wary eye, but Kansas City Southern is seen as one of the last operators of size potentially available for purchase. Its allure has only grown as the economy recovers from the slowdown triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Canadian Pacific had clinched a cash-and-stock deal with Kansas City Southern valued at around $275 per share, or $25 billion. Kansas City Southern later agreed to a sale to Canadian National instead after CN offered about $30 billion (or $325 a share) and Canadian Pacific declined to raise its offer."
