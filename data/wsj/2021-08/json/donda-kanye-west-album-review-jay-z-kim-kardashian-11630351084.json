    "body": "<br /><br /><br /><br />Kanye West’s two most recent solo albums had barely 50 minutes of music between them. “Ye,” from 2018, featured seven songs created amid a flurry of studio activity in Wyoming. The following year’s “Jesus Is King” was a gospel record, a first for the rapper and producer, and among its 11 tracks were sketches that lasted only a minute or two. Both LPs seemed rushed, light on inspiration and too slight to matter. One hoped for something weightier and more ambitious from Mr. West’s next album, perhaps a release to remind us of the sprawling 2010 masterpiece “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” or something more focused and potent, like the dazzling electro-grind of 2013’s “Yeezus.” Something big that takes up space in the musical landscape, in other words, the way Mr. West’s records used to."
