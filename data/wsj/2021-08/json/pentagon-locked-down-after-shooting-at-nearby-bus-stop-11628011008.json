    "body": "A Pentagon police officer was stabbed to death Tuesday and a suspect was fatally shot by law enforcement during a confrontation that erupted at a transit station outside the Pentagon, sending the complex into lockdown, authorities said.<br />At 10:37 a.m. “a Pentagon police officer was attacked on the Metro bus platform, gunfire was exchanged, and there were several casualties,” Pentagon Force Protection Agency Police Chief Woodrow Kusse said during a press briefing, but declined to say how many were injured.<br />Chief Kusse didn’t identify the police officer and wouldn’t confirm that an officer was killed, but law-enforcement officials familiar with the investigation said the officer later died from his injuries. The chief cited a continuing investigation for not releasing any additional details about the attack, but also said there was no longer a threat to the Pentagon.<br />“We are not actively looking for another suspect at this time,” Chief Kusse said, adding that officials were still trying to determine a motive.<br />Law-enforcement officials briefed on the investigation identified the suspect as 27-year-old Austin William Lanz."
