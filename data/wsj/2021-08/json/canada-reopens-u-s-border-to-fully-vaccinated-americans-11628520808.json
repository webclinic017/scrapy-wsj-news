    "body": "CORNWALL, Ontario—Canada opened its border to fully vaccinated American tourists on Monday, raising hopes in border towns and tourist hot spots that businesses hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic will get a boost from out-of-country visitors before the end of the summer.<br />Some Americans said they planned to cross the border at their first opportunity so they could reunite with romantic partners they haven’t seen in more than a year. Others said they would return to vacation properties they own in Canada or visit friends and relatives who live on the other side of the border.<br />Natasha Marsh, who lives near Buffalo, N.Y., crossed the border immediately after it reopened so she could meet her partner, who lives in Toronto, at a Tim Hortons’ coffee shop in the Canadian border town of Fort Erie.<br />“We have missed so much of each other’s lives, so many milestones,” Ms. Marsh said before the planned meeting. “We just want to reconnect again.”<br />On Monday, she said she waited two hours to cross the border but was processed quickly once she reached the front of the line."
