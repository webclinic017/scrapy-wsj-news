    "body": "Senate Democrats released an outline Monday of the $3.5 trillion antipoverty, healthcare and climate plan they hope to approve this fall without Republican support. Here are details on the proposal and the steps needed to turn the broad budget framework into actual legislation and law.<br />The legislation is expected to include paid family and medical leave, subsidized child care, an extension of an expanded child tax credit, universal prekindergarten for three- and four-year-olds and two years of tuition-free community college. It will also provide green cards to millions of immigrants.<br />It would also extend expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies approved earlier this year in the Covid-19 aid package.The plan would broaden Medicare benefits to cover dental, vision and hearing—and would aim to reduce the cost of prescription drugs by allowing Medicare to negotiate prices, among other steps.<br />Yes. Democrats are proposing a series of ideas, including tax credits for clean-energy investments and a “plan resembling a clean electricity standard,” aimed at reducing carbon emissions in the electricity sector by 80% and economywide by 50% by 2030.<br />Democrats are also proposing polluter import fees. Such fees could help lower emissions globally while generating revenue for the U.S., effectively acting as an emissions-based tariff."
