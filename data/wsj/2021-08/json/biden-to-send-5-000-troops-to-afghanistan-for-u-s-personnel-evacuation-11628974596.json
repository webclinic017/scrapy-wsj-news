    "body": "President Biden said Saturday he would send approximately 5,000 U.S. troops to safely evacuate U.S. and allied personnel, a force slightly larger than the 3,000 personnel already in transit back to Afghanistan and the 1,000 already there.<br />Mr. Biden made the decisions after consultations with top advisers while he was working at Camp David. Mr. Biden also defended his decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, as the Taliban continues to advance in the country.<br />The steps announced by Mr. Biden don’t represent a major course correction in his decision to withdraw American forces from Afghanistan and largely consist of adjustments to moves already under way as he seeks to disengage from America’s longest war.<br />“I was the fourth President to preside over an American troop presence in Afghanistan—two Republicans, two Democrats. I would not, and will not, pass this war onto a fifth,” he said in a statement.<br />The 5,000 troops include the 3,000 U.S. infantry troops, including one Army and two Marine Corps units, that were announced last week, as well as another 1,000 troops already stationed on the ground. Mr. Biden’s announcement Saturday effectively means there will be an additional 1,000 troops sent from the Gulf region into Kabul due to the worsening security situation there."
