    "body": "OTTAWA—Canada’s plan to reopen its border next week to U.S. tourists could be in trouble as the union representing customs and immigration officers said it is ready to cut services at land crossings, airports and shipping ports Friday morning unless a new labor agreement is struck.<br />A labor disruption could upend the North American economy, given the tight supply-chain links between the U.S. and Canada. Furthermore, it could deal another blow to Canadian businesses in the travel, tourism and hospitality sectors, where sales plummeted due to the Covid-19 pandemic amid border restrictions in place since March of last year, and which were relying on a partial reopening to help salvage what is left of the summer season.<br />Canada said last month it would reopen its borders to fully-vaccinated U.S. citizens and permanent residents currently living in the U.S. to enter for tourism and recreation purposes, starting Aug. 9.<br />“A strike could dissuade fully vaccinated Americans from making a trip if they are concerned about undue delays,” said Mark Agnew, vice president of policy at Canadian Chamber of Commerce.<br />The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has extended its land-border restrictions with Canada and Mexico through Aug. 21."
