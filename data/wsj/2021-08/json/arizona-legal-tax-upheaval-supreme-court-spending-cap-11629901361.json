    "body": "Victories for constitutionally limited government are rare these days. All the more reason to cheer a ruling last week by the Arizona Supreme Court that effectively deep-sixed a ballot initiative that overrode a spending cap in Arizona’s constitution (Fann v. State of Arizona).<br />Put forward by a coalition led by teachers unions, Prop 208 was designed to evade the state constitution’s limits in order to tax and spend millions of dollars for new school spending. Passed narrowly in 2020, the measure imposed a 3.5% tax surcharge on Arizonans who made more than $250,000 filing singly or $500,000 for married couples.<br />The estimate was that this tax increase would generate $827 million in revenue, which would then go directly to the schools. To get around the constitutional limit on spending, the measure called these funds “grants” instead of “spending.”<br />But the Arizona Supreme Court wasn’t buying. Writing for a 6-1 majority, Chief Justice Robert Brutinel held that the tax increase is unconstitutional subject to some pro forma fact-finding by a lower court. Here’s how the majority opinion puts it:<br />“If the trial court finds that the tax revenues allocated will not exceed the expenditure limit, then there is no present constitutional violation and Prop. 208 stands. However, if the trial court finds that [the law] will result in the accumulation of money that cannot be spent without violating the expenditure limit, it must declare Prop. 208 unconstitutional and enjoin its operation.”"
