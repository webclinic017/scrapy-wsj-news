    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Securities and Exchange Commission is considering asking public companies to disclose more information about their workforces.<br />“Investors want to better understand one of the most critical assets of a company: its people,” SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said earlier this week in a Twitter thread. “I’ve asked staff to propose recommendations for the Commission’s consideration on human capital disclosure.”<br />Mr. Gensler previously said the disclosures would likely be mandatory for public companies and could touch on a number of metrics, including turnover, skills and development training, compensation, benefits, workforce demographics including diversity, and health and safety.<br />The SEC included human-capital disclosures on a list of potential rule-making items it published on June 11.<br />Large companies have already been moving to provide more information about diversity in their workforces, a Wall Street Journal analysis found in March."
