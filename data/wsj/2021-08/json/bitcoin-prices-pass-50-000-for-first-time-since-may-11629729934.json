After skidding to a low of $29,608 last month, bitcoin has leapt 70%.<br />A surge of retail investor enthusiasm had helped bitcoin soar in the first few months of the year. But prices then took a hit after a series of setbacks, including  Tesla Inc.  saying it would no longer accept bitcoin as payment for its electric vehicles and Chinese regulators stepping up a crackdown on cryptocurrency trading in the country.<br />Lately, some money managers and institutions have signaled more support for the cryptocurrency.  PayPal Holdings Inc.  said Monday that it would introduce a service allowing U.K. customers to buy, hold and sell bitcoin, as well as ethereum, litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. PayPal rolled out the same feature for U.S. customers in November."
