    "body": "A powerful earthquake struck Haiti on Saturday, killing at least 227 people and injuring many others as several buildings collapsed, burying people under rubble in the impoverished country.<br />The magnitude 7.2 earthquake’s epicenter was about 7.5 miles from the southern town of Saint-Louis du Sud, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The quake, which occurred at about 8:30 a.m. Haitian time, had a depth of 6.2 miles.<br />“There is a lot of destruction. There are several dead,” said Jose Flecher, a local journalist in Les Cayes, a city of about 125,000 people about 20 miles from Saint-Louis du Sud. “The hospitals are overwhelmed. There are a lot of injured. People are gathering in the streets because they have heard there is a risk of a tsunami.”<br />Haiti’s Civil Protection agency said that at least 227 people had died, including 158 in the south of the country—and that hundreds more were injured or missing.<br />Many people had been extracted from the rubble by first responders and civilians, the civil protection agency said in a message on Twitter. Hospitals continued to receive the wounded, it added."
