    "body": "Sales for  Home Depot Inc.  continued their upward trend in the latest quarter, but the company’s year-over-year growth rate slowed against the comparison to last summer, when the coronavirus pandemic began driving higher home-improvement spending.<br />The Atlanta-based retailer logged sales of $41.12 billion for the three months through Aug. 1, a rise from $38.05 billion in the same quarter in 2020. The number of customer transactions fell about 6%, but Home Depot made up that ground through a larger average transaction size.<br />Comparable sales in the quarter grew by 4.5%, including a 3.4% increase in the U.S. That marked slower growth compared with last year, when lockdowns, financial stimulus and a red-hot residential housing market were combining to give home-improvement spending a dramatic boost. In each of the previous four quarters, the company’s comparable sales growth exceeded 20%.<br />Home Depot’s profit was $4.81 billion, up from $4.33 billion in the year-ago quarter. On a per-share basis, its earnings were $4.53. Analysts were forecasting earnings of $4.36 a share, according to FactSet.<br />Shares of the company declined about 4.2% in premarket trading Tuesday."
