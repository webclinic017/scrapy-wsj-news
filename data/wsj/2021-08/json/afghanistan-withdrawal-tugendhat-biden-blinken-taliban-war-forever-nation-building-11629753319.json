    "body": "Tom Tugendhat, a Conservative member and veteran of Afghanistan, speaking in Britain’s House of Commons Aug. 18:<br /><br />I was never prouder than when I was decorated by the 82nd Airborne after the capture of Musa Qala. It was a huge privilege to be recognized by such an extraordinary unit in combat. To see their commander in chief call into question the courage of men I fought with—to claim that they ran. It is shameful.<br />Those who have never fought for the colors they fly should be careful about criticizing those who have. Because what we have done, in these last few days, is we’ve demonstrated that it’s not armies that win wars. . . . It’s nations that make war. Nations endure. Nations mobilize and muster. Nations determine, and have patience. . . .<br />So let’s stop talking about “forever wars”; let’s recognize that forever peace is not bought cheaply—it is hard. It is bought through determination and the will to endure. The tragedy of Afghanistan is that we are swapping that patient achievement for a second fire and a second war."
