    "body": "A California judge said the November ballot measure that allowed Uber Technologies Inc.,  Lyft Inc.  and  DoorDash Inc.  to continue treating their drivers as independent contractors is unenforceable and unconstitutional.<br />The companies, which spent more than $200 million to pass Proposition 22 in November, said they would appeal the ruling.<br />The companies don’t need to immediately change their way of doing business, but Friday’s ruling adds a wrinkle in their efforts to preserve their independent-worker models and serves as a setback in their yearslong fight against the California law at the heart of the ruling.<br />Uber and other companies are in a global tug of war with regulators over whether and how to grant more benefits like paid sick leave and health insurance to workers in the so-called gig economy, where apps distribute individual tasks to a pool of people whom are generally regarded as independent contractors.<br />California sued the companies last year, saying they were in violation of the state’s so-called gig law because none of them reclassified their drivers as employees after the statute went into effect in 2020. A high-stakes legal battle ensued, culminating in Proposition 22, in which the companies asked state voters to exempt them from the law."
