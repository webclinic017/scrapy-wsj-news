    "body": "Seventy-five years after its premiere in theaters, Alfred Hitchcock’s “Notorious” remains a masterpiece of manipulation. Its rather sordid story of a credulous woman used by the FBI to outwit Nazis living undercover in Brazil is enrobed in elegance and emotional tension, to the point that the audience cannot help but sympathize with both the lovers and the “villain” they seek to unmask.<br />The ninth film made by the British director in Hollywood, “Notorious” took two years to create. Late in 1944, while World War II was still raging, Hitchcock and the veteran screenwriter Ben Hecht conceived a Nazi plot to use uranium-235 for a weapon that would somehow restore the power of the Third Reich. This was almost a full year before atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the Americans.<br />David O. Selznick, to whom Hitchcock was contracted, found the story implausible, and sold “Notorious” to RKO Radio Pictures as a package for $800,000 (close to $12 million today). When François Truffaut told the master, “This is truly my favorite Hitchcock picture,” Hitchcock responded with the comment that “Notorious” had cost RKO some $2 million and had grossed $8 million—a profit of some $84 million in 2021.<br />The film’s dramatic theme was no guarantee of success, however. Orson Welles’s “The Stranger,” which opened just one month prior to “Notorious,” also dealt with Nazis on the run but failed to please either critics or audiences. The brilliance of “Notorious” stems from its casting of Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant and the underestimated Claude Rains, allied to Hitchcock’s meticulous control of dialogue, image and music. Hecht had first worked with Hitchcock on “Foreign Correspondent” and was renowned for his speed in concocting or even rescuing a screenplay. The verbal exchanges in “Notorious” exemplify Hecht’s skill in suggesting profound feelings under cover of everyday conversation (Grant’s laconic “I’ve always been scared of women, but I’ll get over it”).<br />The debonair yet somber Devlin (Grant) finds himself more than just beguiled by the fresh-faced candor of Bergman’s Alicia Huberman, whose father has been imprisoned for fomenting a Nazi revival in Florida. Devlin obeys his FBI superiors by persuading Alicia, a reluctant Mata Hari, to get involved with a Nazi fugitive, now posing as Alex Sebastian (Rains) in Rio de Janeiro."
