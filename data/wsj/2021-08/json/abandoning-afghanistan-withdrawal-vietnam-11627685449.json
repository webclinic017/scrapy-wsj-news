    "body": "H.R. McMaster and Bradley Bowman offer excellent advice on “How to Avert Disaster in Afghanistan” (op-ed, July 27) and repurpose U.S. troops. If our continued presence in Iraq is necessary to counter Iran’s regional strategy—and it is critical geopolitically—how much more convincing is the need to be present as a buffer to both Iran and China with a continuing presence in Afghanistan.<br />As Messrs. McMaster and Bowman (whom I served alongside in uniform in Kabul and Kandahar in 2010) have clearly stated, at risk in Afghanistan is a complete collapse, a destabilizing tide of desperate refugees and the emboldening of “enemies of all civilized peoples” that will require the U.S. to re-enter the fray at some future inopportune time.<br />Rear Adm. Kathleen Dussault, USN (Ret.)<br />Henderson, Nev.<br />"
