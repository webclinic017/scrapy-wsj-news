It’s just nuts,” says the 67-year-old systems architect, who has bought Galaxy Note smartphones for the last decade.<br />I try to reassure and comfort Mr. Fidelman in this rough time. “It’s going to be OK. The Galaxy Note lives on forever—in every smartphone, in every tablet, in every heart,” I tell him. But he and lots of other Galaxy Note fans aren’t having it.<br />Samsung  stopped short of calling the Note’s time of death. But there are reasons to think its days are over. On Wednesday, at the late-summer event where the company typically unveils its newest Galaxy Note models, it instead introduced two new folding phones—the Z Flip3 5G and the Z Fold3.<br />The Fold, which starts at $1,800 and has a 7.6-inch screen that opens like a book, supports Samsung’s styluses—aka S Pens. The $50 S Pen Fold Edition and $100 S Pen Pro will be sold separately."
