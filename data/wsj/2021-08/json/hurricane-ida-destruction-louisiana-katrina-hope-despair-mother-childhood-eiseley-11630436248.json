    "body": "Baton Rouge, La.<br />As Hurricane Betsy tore through Louisiana in 1965, my mother held me in her arms and rocked me through the night. I was an infant with an ear infection, and as raging rain and the late hour kept us from getting medical help, Mama did what she could to comfort me in the long stretch before daylight. While the winds howled and I howled louder, the woman who had given me life a year before rocked and prayed.<br />I have no memory of that ordeal, but my mother told me the story often as a way to say, without quite spelling it out, that even the darkest night can be endured. Mama died in 2008, but I think of her every time a hurricane rolls over my home in Baton Rouge, as on Sunday when Hurricane Ida arrived.<br />Hurricanes are scary, and they are even scarier when they approach after dark. I always feel a pit in my stomach when the neighborhood transformers surrender to the gusts and the streets plunge into cast-iron gloom.<br />Keeping anxious vigil, all a seasoned veteran of hurricanes can do is listen as the storm whips one tree after another. Facing that fright in darkness makes it worse. In those moments, I usually feel deeply alone, even within the folds of family. Ida’s arrival on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina only deepened the desolation. Like many Louisianians, I recall the date of Katrina’s landfall—Aug. 29, 2005—as vividly as 9/11."
