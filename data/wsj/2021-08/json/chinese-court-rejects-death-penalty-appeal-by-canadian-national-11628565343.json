    "body": "HONG KONG—A Chinese court reaffirmed the death penalty for a Canadian national convicted of drug smuggling in a case that has taken on increased geopolitical significance, given Canada’s detention of a prominent Huawei Technologies Co. executive at the behest of the U.S.<br />Robert Schellenberg was found to have engaged in organized international drug smuggling and was guilty of smuggling more than 200 kilograms of methamphetamine together with others, the Liaoning High People’s Court in northeastern China said. The ruling, announced on the court’s website Tuesday, called the evidence presented at his initial trial “reliable and sufficient.”<br />An earlier death sentence imposed on Mr. Schellenberg in January 2019 after a one-day hearing, just days after his retrial was announced, was “appropriate and the trial procedures were legal,” the court said in its statement.<br />Two months earlier, a court in Dalian had sentenced Mr. Schellenberg to 15 years in prison, but in his retrial prosecutors charged him with being a key figure, not merely an accessory, in an international drug-smuggling ring.<br />Mr. Schellenberg, who is in his late 30s, has maintained his innocence throughout the legal process, which dates back to his arrest in 2014."
