    "body": "ESPN removed Rachel Nichols from its National Basketball Association coverage and canceled her show, a decision that comes a month after a report surfaced in which she criticized a colleague’s role at the network.<br />The network said Wednesday that Ms. Nichols would no longer report from the sidelines of NBA games. Her weekday afternoon show, “The Jump,” would also be canceled, ESPN said.<br />In a tweet, Ms. Nichols thanked ESPN’s producers and crew, and said there would be more to come from her. “ ‘The Jump’ was never built to last forever but it sure was fun,” Ms. Nichols said in the  Twitter  post.<br />Ms. Nichols wasn’t immediately available for additional comment beyond her social-media post.<br />The move comes a month after the New York Times reported on a recording of a phone call last year by Ms. Nichols in which she complained about how the job of anchoring “NBA Countdown” telecasts had gone to another ESPN personality, Maria Taylor, instead of her."
