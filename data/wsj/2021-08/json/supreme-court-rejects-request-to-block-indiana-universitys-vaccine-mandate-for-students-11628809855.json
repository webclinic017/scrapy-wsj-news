    "body": "WASHINGTON—Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett on Thursday rejected an emergency request by a group of Indiana University students who were seeking to block the school from enforcing a Covid-19 vaccine requirement for the coming semester.<br />The school is requiring students to be vaccinated unless they are exempt for religious or medical reasons, and in those circumstances, individuals must wear masks and be tested for the virus regularly.<br />The emergency appeal marked the first time a Covid-19 vaccine mandate reached the Supreme Court.<br />Lower courts declined to block the policy, saying the students were unlikely to prevail on claims that the mandate violated the Constitution.<br />The students filed an emergency request for an injunction last week with Justice Barrett, who oversees such fast-track petitions from Indiana. On Thursday, she denied the request without comment—and without referring the matter to the full high court for consideration."
