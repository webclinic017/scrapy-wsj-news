    "body": "Investigators for state Attorney General Letitia James concluded in an early August report that Mr. Cuomo broke state and federal sexual-harassment laws by inappropriately touching or making comments to 11 women, including current and former aides and state workers. The report was commissioned last spring, following a series of allegations by several of the women, which also helped prompt an impeachment investigation by the New York state Assembly.<br />As part of its impeachment probe, the assembly is also examining Mr. Cuomo’s handling of Covid-19 deaths at nursing-home facilities and whether he used state resources in the production of his pandemic memoir.<br />The Democratic governor has denied inappropriately touching anybody and said Ms. James’s review was biased. One of his accusers, an executive assistant to the governor, has filed a criminal complaint with the Albany County Sheriff’s Office, saying Mr. Cuomo groped her in his office. Mr. Cuomo’s lawyers have said he never groped the woman.<br />State officials said their nursing-home policies were crafted to preserve hospital capacity at the height of the pandemic and were in line with federal guidance at the time. Rich Azzopardi, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, has said some state officials volunteered to work on the book and any other use of state resources was incidental.<br />The Assembly initiates an impeachment and assumes the role of prosecutor and grand jury. After an inquiry and hearings, the 150-member Assembly, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than two to one, will vote on the articles of impeachment."
