    "body": "Customized car buying will seem like a new idea only to those too young to remember how vehicles were sold through the 1970s (“Ford to Test New Way of Selling Cars,” Business & Finance, Aug. 18).  Ford ’s  time-travel adventure could be a winner, but only if it gives buyers a real opportunity to put together the car or truck of their dreams. If Ford intends to offer nothing more than a choice among prepackaged-option combinations, I think it will be a short and unsuccessful journey.<br />Gary Chase<br />University Park, Fla.<br /><br />I started buying cars around 1967, and no fewer than the first half-dozen I bought were built especially to my order. I’d sit with the salesman, he’d check boxes on the order sheet, work up the price, and, assuming we agreed on the price, he’d write up the order. Six or eight weeks later I would get a call that my car had arrived, and I’d arrange to pick it up."
