    "body": "U.S. stock futures edged up Monday, suggesting that the major indexes will kick off the week on the front foot as investors await data on the American manufacturing and services sectors.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 ticked 0.3% higher, pointing to the broad market index extending Friday’s 0.8% gain. Nasdaq-100 futures also climbed 0.3%, indicating a modest rise in technology stocks after the opening bell.<br />Investors are largely focused on the Federal Reserve’s annual economic policy symposium later this week, awaiting fresh cues on when policy makers may slow bond purchases. At the same time, rising concerns that elevated Covid-19 infection levels may slow the global economic recovery sent stocks lower last week. Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan said Friday he may rethink his call to begin tapering asset purchases soon if the Delta variant weighs on growth.<br />“If there is any sign that the U.S. economy is slowing, the Fed won’t taper,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. “There is a long way between laying out a pathway to tapering and actually doing it.”<br />In premarket trading, shares in ride-hailing firms declined after a California judge said a measure that sought to continue treating their drivers as independent contractors rather than employees is unconstitutional.  Uber Technologies  dropped almost 4% and  Lyft  fell over 4%."
