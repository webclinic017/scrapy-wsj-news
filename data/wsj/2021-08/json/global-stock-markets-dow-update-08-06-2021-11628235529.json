    "body": "U.S. stock futures wavered Friday ahead of quarterly earnings and a jobs report that will give insights into the pace of business activity and the economic rebound.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 were roughly flat, putting the broad stocks gauge on course for a muted weekly advance. Contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked up less than 0.1%. Futures for the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 fell 0.1%.<br />Stocks have waffled near record highs this week. Investors are weighing a strong set of quarterly results among the biggest U.S. companies against the prospect that rising coronavirus cases could put the brakes on consumer spending. Many are also wary of risks stemming from China’s regulatory assault on technology companies and the potential for higher interest rates if inflation remains elevated.<br />The market “is sort of grinding higher very slowly,” said Trevor Greetham, a fund manager at Royal London Asset Management. “It feels quite fragile to me: It feels like the stock market could get knocked, at least temporarily, by bad Delta variant news. But it would be a dip that would bounce back.”<br />At the same time, Mr. Greetham said now isn’t the time to be underweight stocks—or own less than the share included in benchmark indexes—because earnings are still surging."
