    "body": "Apple Inc.  is delaying back-to-work plans for its U.S. corporate offices until early next year as a rise in Covid-19 cases in the country continues to disrupt companies’ efforts to have employees back in place.<br />Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s human resources leader, told employees in a Thursday email that the planned return would be delayed until at least January. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company had told staff in July that they wouldn’t need to return until at least October. Ms. O’Brien also urged employees to get vaccinated. Bloomberg News earlier reported her message to staff.<br />In June, Chief Executive Tim Cook told Apple office workers they would be expected to return to their workplaces three days a week beginning in September.<br />A surge in Covid-19 cases due to the Delta variant has caused many companies to rethink their plans to bring employees back to the office. Other large technology companies such as Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. have delayed their office return until January.<br />Apple last year was among the first U.S. companies to have workers stay at home when the pandemic started. The company has on several occasions closed its retail stores amid virus outbreaks in certain areas. Apple began to gradually reopen its stores and had all U.S. retail locations back open in March."
