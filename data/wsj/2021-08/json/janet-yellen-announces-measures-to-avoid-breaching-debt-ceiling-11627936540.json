    "body": "WASHINGTON—Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday revealed further measures to avoid breaching the federal government’s borrowing limit and urged Congress to increase the ceiling, which went back into effect on Sunday.<br />The Treasury Department will begin a debt-issuance suspension period on Monday and will suspend investments in retirement funds for civil servants and postal workers, among other measures, Ms. Yellen said in a letter to congressional leaders. The funds will be made whole once the debt limit is either suspended or increased, she said.<br />“I respectfully urge Congress to protect the full faith and credit of the United States by acting as soon as possible,” she said.<br />Congress voted in July 2019 to suspend the debt limit until July 31, 2021, after which the prior limit of $22 trillion would be reset to include any new borrowing in the intervening years. On Sunday, the limit was reinstated at around $28.5 trillion, a figure that includes debt held by the public and by government agencies.<br />Concerns over large deficits and debt prompted Republican lawmakers in recent weeks to say the GOP may oppose a debt-limit increase."
