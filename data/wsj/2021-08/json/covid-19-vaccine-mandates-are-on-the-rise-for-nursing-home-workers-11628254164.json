    "body": "More states and employers are requiring nursing home staff to be vaccinated as the latest Delta-driven Covid-19 surge leads to more cases in some facilities.<br />California late Thursday said all health workers, including in nursing homes, must complete their vaccine shots by Sept. 30. Massachusetts a day earlier said it would mandate shots for long-term-care workers, requiring full vaccination by Oct. 10.<br />Illinois and Maryland this week announced mandates that cover just state workers in group settings. New Jersey’s governor on Monday announced a vaccine requirement for health settings including nursing homes, and said workers who aren’t compliant by early next month will require frequent testing. Connecticut is considering a mandate for nursing homes, too, a spokesman for Gov. Ned Lamont said.<br />Cities and companies are acting, too. Denver announced a vaccine mandate Monday covering private-sector workers in high-risk places like nursing homes.  Genesis Healthcare Inc.,  the biggest nursing home company, said this week it is adopting a universal vaccine requirement for workers.<br />“Despite vaccination rates above the national average, the growing spread of the Delta variant makes clear that we need to increase our vaccination rates substantially to better protect our patients, residents and employees,” Chief Executive Harry Wilson said in a statement."
