    "body": "Millions of renters are at risk of being evicted and the states and cities charged with providing emergency rental aid are unlikely to reach many in time, after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a national ban on most evictions Thursday night.<br />Landlords, with the exception of those in a handful of states and cities that have their own restrictions, will be able to go to court and obtain evictions for unpaid rent.<br />In most courts, eviction cases that have been delayed by judges for many months and can now begin to go forward again. In others, evictions that were approved and in the hands of marshals and sheriffs are ready to be executed. In states including Texas, some judges were allowing evictions to go forward, despite the ban.<br />Only about 11% of the $47 billion program for rental assistance created by Congress to help tenants and landlords and prevent evictions had been distributed, the U.S. Treasury Department said this week.<br />In a letter written Friday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other senior officials called on state and local leaders to do a better job distributing the aid by making the application process simpler."
