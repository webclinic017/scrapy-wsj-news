    "body": "After a steady decline this spring, worker filings for new unemployment benefits have settled this summer at a level that is nearly double the pre-pandemic average.<br />The trend, some economists say, could be happening while the labor market continues to recover from the pandemic and be part of a development where claims remain higher because of greater awareness of unemployment insurance programs.<br />“Many people before the pandemic just simply didn’t apply for unemployment insurance, even if they were eligible,” Daniel Zhao, senior economist at job-search site Glassdoor, said. “So we might see permanent higher levels of claims, even if the jobs recovery is continuing,”<br />Mr. Zhao said that while the totals for new jobless claims have started to level off, he thinks the labor market and broader economy continue to steadily recover despite risks from the Covid-19 surge driven by the Delta variant, supply-chain constraints and a shortage of available workers.<br />“There is a lot of potential for job growth in the coming months,” Mr. Zhao added."
