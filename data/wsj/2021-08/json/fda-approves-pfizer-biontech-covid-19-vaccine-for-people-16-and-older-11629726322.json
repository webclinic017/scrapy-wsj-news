    "body": "The Covid-19 vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and partner  BioNTech SE  received full approval from U.S. regulators, which many public health officials and vaccine experts hope will encourage hesitant populations to get the shot.<br />The Food and Drug Administration’s clearance of the shot on Monday, for people 16 years and older, is the agency’s first full approval of a Covid-19 vaccine. The decision was expected this week, The Wall Street Journal and other news outlets reported.<br />The vaccine was first cleared in December by the FDA on an emergency-use basis for people 16 years and older after the drugmakers showed it to be highly effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19. The two-dose shot, resulting from the fastest vaccine development ever in the West, has since become the most-received Covid-19 vaccine in the U.S.<br />The vaccine was authorized for children as young as 12 years in May. Pfizer plans to request full approval for that group once it has collected and analyzed six months of safety data from clinical-trial subjects, according to the company.<br />The FDA, under pressure to give Covid-19 vaccines full approval swiftly, made its decision less than four months after Pfizer began its approval submission. The process of reviewing applications normally takes up to approximately 10 months."
