    "body": "For the better part of a decade, I have been on a quest to find the perfect beach chair. Wooed by slick Instagram ads promising a better, more life-altering seat, I buy a newer, fancier model annually. Then right about this time of summer, I realize its shortcomings.<br />My efforts aren’t lost on my regular beach-sitting crew. As we gather each July at Wiborg Beach in East Hampton, N.Y., they watch with amusement as I unveil my latest. Sometimes it is tricked out and, often, complicated to use. This year, I blew the bank and went big, arriving on the sand with a $198 Sunflow. As I muddled through the five-step process of opening it, I assured my friends (as I have with other chairs in the past) that it was, in fact, “the Cadillac of beach chairs.” Every year, on cue, my friend Martha somewhat smugly says that her small, no-name chair is old (14 this year), that it is “perfect” and that she OxiCleans it at the end of each season to keep it looking new. It doesn’t do much: It opens. And it closes. These two factors should not be taken for granted. I once had to stuff a new seat into the back of my car fully ajar after I couldn’t get it to fold down. (Another not only tipped over while I sat in it but was so difficult to open I felt certain hundreds of comfortably seated sunbathers were mocking me as I tried to set it up.)<br />To save you the shame, struggle and expense of buying the wrong beach chair yourself, I decided to conduct a slightly more scientific review of my fleet, as well as some new additions. I built my test list off the suggestions I gathered by asking fellow beachgoers about their own chairs. Most people, I learned, have strong opinions. I made sure to hit various price points and include a range of standout features, from ultra-strong frames to customizable cushions. I also weeded out a few camping and lawn chairs not made primarily for sand. Then I enlisted the help of friends and strangers to test the comfort, style and ease of use each offered. Here, my favorite six.<br />The petite, no-nonsense Rio Wave opens to just one position and boasts not so much as a cupholder. But what this seat lacks in features it makes up for in value and consistency. At under $40, it’s less than half the price of the next-most-expensive model we recommend, and it employs a ripstop fabric and steel frame to withstand sand and surf.<br />User Friendliness: Beyond price, this chair’s best attribute is its weight: 5 pounds. You can carry two on one arm and your cooler in the other. It’s so low and close to the sand, however, that getting out of it requires agility."
