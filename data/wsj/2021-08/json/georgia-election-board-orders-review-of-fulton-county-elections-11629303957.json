    "body": "ATLANTA—Georgia’s State Election Board appointed a panel to investigate past elections in Fulton County, taking a step toward a possible takeover of election operations in the state’s most populous county.<br />The move comes after a highly contentious election season in which Republicans lost key races in Georgia, including the presidency. After the losses, the GOP-led legislature passed voting law changes this spring that included a provision for the state to take over a county election board if it was deemed to have chronic mismanagement or fraud problems.<br />Democrats say the new laws are an effort to restrict Democratic votes, and the Biden administration is suing the state over the new law.<br />At the request of Republican state lawmakers, the State Election Board appointed a panel to investigate Fulton County’s elections. The bipartisan panel is composed of two local election officials and one official from the Georgia secretary of state’s office.<br />The State Election Board has three Republican-nominated members and one Democratic member."
