    "body": "WASHINGTON—The police officer who shot and killed Ashli Babbitt during the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol said he opened fire as a “last resort” as a crowd of rioters smashed through a door of the Speaker’s Lobby and approached the lawmakers he said he was trying to protect.<br />“I tried to wait as long as I could,” Lt. Michael Byrd told “NBC Nightly News” anchor Lester Holt, revealing his face and identity on national television despite what he said has been a flood of death threats since the shooting.<br />“I hoped and prayed no one tried to enter through those doors. But their failure to comply required me to take the appropriate action to save the lives of members of Congress and myself and my fellow officers,” NBC quoted Lt. Byrd as telling Mr. Holt.<br />Those and other comments from Lt. Byrd weren’t included in the brief televised segment of the interview that aired Thursday night but were posted on the network’s website.<br />Ms. Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was among hundreds of supporters of then-President Donald Trump who stormed the halls of Congress that day, battling officers and causing extensive damage to the building as they sought to disrupt the certification of President Biden’s electoral victory."
