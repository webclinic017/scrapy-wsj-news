    "body": "The masks are back.<br />On Monday,  Home Depot Corp. ,  McDonald’s Corp ,  Target Corp.  and  Facebook Inc.  said they would require workers to wear masks in many of their stores, restaurants and offices regardless of vaccination status.<br />The moves mirror policies implemented by other companies last week, including  Walmart Inc.  and  Citigroup Inc.,  in the wake of new guidance on mask wearing from U.S. health officials.<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended last week that vaccinated people resume wearing masks in some indoor spaces, reversing its earlier guidance. On Friday, the CDC said vaccinated people may spread the Delta variant of the coronavirus.<br />Many retailers, technology companies and restaurants are taking new steps on masks or requiring some employees to be vaccinated following shifts in the CDC guidelines and municipal requirements as Covid-19 cases jump in the U.S."
