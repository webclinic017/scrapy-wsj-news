    "body": "San Francisco<br />Approaching the Asian Art Museum’s beaux-arts building from Civic Center Plaza across the street, one might assume nothing has changed despite an almost six-year, $100 million-plus expansion and upgrading project. Completed in 2020, it is only now inaugurating its new exhibition spaces. But make your way to the entrance from neighborhood shops behind the museum and three murals proclaim otherwise. Visible through floor-to-ceiling windows are the line drawings of “Know My Name: A Memoir” by Chanel Miller; Jenifer K. Wofford’s color-rich “Pattern Recognition” fills a wall at street level; and, when you round the corner, the woman in Jas Charanjiva’s blue and pink “Don’t Mess With Me” looks down from a terrace, one hand raised in a brass-knuckled thumbs up. For a museum whose collection spans some 6,000 years to greet us with contemporary works from Asia and the Asian diaspora is tantamount to its shouting “Asian art is a phenomenon with a past, not of the past!”<br />The museum has long been making this point. Curators have incorporated modern and contemporary paintings, ceramics and other small and medium-scale works in some of the collection’s galleries and displayed large-scale installations in ground-floor lobby areas. But these often felt like isolated postscripts. Now, contemporary art has a larger, more integrated presence. A new 8,500-square-foot, state-of-the-art gallery for special exhibitions enables them to dedicate one of the existing first-floor galleries to contemporary commissions and acquisitions. In designing this extension, Los Angeles-based architect Kulapat Yantrasast added a rooftop art terrace scheduled to open later this month or in early September.<br />Two works are already in place: “Don’t Mess With Me” and Ai Weiwei’s 2007 “Fountain of Light,” a glittering, glass-beaded rendition of Vladimir Tatlin’s spiraling 1919-20 “Monument to the Third International.” These will be joined by Ala Ebtekar’s “Luminous Ground,” a 55-foot-long expanse of handmade tiles on which the artist has printed images from the Hubble telescope using cyanotype, an early photographic process with a Prussian blue hue. From the terrace, visitors will be able to enter the second- and third-floor collection galleries, stepping into a past that was at times as varied, dynamic and global as the world in which artists work today.<br />Here the layout remains largely unchanged, with selections from the museum’s 18,000 or so holdings organized within geographic sections that have both chronological sequences and thematic groupings—a case of Indonesian gold jewelry, say, or a dark-walled room filled with Chinese jade carvings. Each section also singles out one or two masterpieces that now have more eye-catching and informative presentations."
