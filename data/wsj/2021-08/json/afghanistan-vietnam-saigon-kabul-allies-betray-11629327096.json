    "body": "William McGurn writes that President Biden’s Afghanistan moment recalls images of U.S. helicopters fleeing in 1975 from atop the embassy in Saigon (“All the President’s Weaknesses,” Main Street, Aug. 17). But the deeper comparison revolves around Mr. Biden’s decision to pull the plug on the Afghan army by abruptly withdrawing logistical, intelligence and close air support and maintenance, then blaming the Afghans for refusing to fight. He did this despite high casualties taken and the disorientation and demoralization his action induced. Mr. Biden thereby showed contempt for the U.S. ally, essentially stating they were unworthy of continued U.S. investment.<br />Such treatment recalls how Congress defunded the South Vietnamese government after the U.S. fully turned over combat operations to the ARVN in 1973. The South soldiered on until 1975, but without funding it had to redeploy to more easily defended combat zones. The resulting retreat turned into a rout, which translated to military collapse.<br />South Vietnamese corruption, incompetence and lack of will to fight was blamed for the debacle, just as Mr. Biden is now denouncing the Afghan government and security forces. In both instances, U.S. government policy ought to shoulder the blame.<br />Em. Prof. Albion M. Urdank<br />University of California, Los Angeles"
