    "body": "Investing should be about seeing the future. That’s hard to do when you are willfully blind.<br />As the new book “The Cult of We: WeWork, Adam Neumann and the Great Startup Delusion,” by my colleagues Eliot Brown and Maureen Farrell, makes embarrassingly clear, the office-space provider didn’t implode without warning. Some of the world’s most-renowned investors—including  SoftBank Group Corp.  of Japan and venture firm Benchmark Capital—watched the entire train wreck transpire in slow motion. For months and years, they stood by, unwilling or unable to get out of the way.<br />Many other investors have been blind to the evidence right under their noses. Fans of gold insist the yellow metal is a powerful hedge against inflation when it isn’t. Bond investors have been vainly predicting a surge in interest rates for more than a decade. Skeptics of  Amazon . com Inc., perennially calling it an absurdly overpriced stock, have missed out on gargantuan gains.<br />That’s what happens when what you own—or scorn—becomes part of who you are. You don’t just invest in gold; you become a gold bug. You don’t merely think interest rates will rise; you turn into a bond bear. You aren’t only skeptical about Amazon; you belong to the value-investing community, which regards itself as rational in a financial world gone mad.<br />Before you know it, you’ve become a true believer: clinging to your investment idea as passionately, rigidly and unquestioningly as a religion or ideology."
