    "body": "Pfizer Inc.<br />The U.S. is giving Covid-19 boosters a shot. ​The Biden administration on Wednesday called for a third vaccine dose starting this fall for adults who were fully vaccinated with the two-shot regimen from Pfizer and partner  BioNTech SE  or from  Moderna Inc.  The booster shot will be administered about eight months after the second dose, starting the week of Sept. 20. Pfizer shares fell 2.2% Wednesday, while Moderna lost 0.8%.<br />Target Corp.<br />People are shopping in person again. Target reported increased revenue in the second quarter as more people returned to stores to purchase apparel, food and other items. Online spending abated at the big-box retailer compared with last summer, when the pandemic upended shopping habits. The report came a day after larger rival  Walmart Inc.  reported strong in-store sales and foot traffic. The results from both chains showed little impact from the recent rise in Covid-19 cases in the U.S. Target executives said that the Delta variant’s spread hasn’t yet resulted in changes to consumer behavior, but they are closely monitoring the situation. Target shares fell 2.8% Wednesday.<br />"
