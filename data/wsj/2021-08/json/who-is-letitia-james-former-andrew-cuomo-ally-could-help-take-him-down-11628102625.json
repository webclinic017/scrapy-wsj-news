    "body": "When Letitia James ran for New York attorney general in 2018, Gov. Andrew Cuomo endorsed his fellow Democrat and appeared at a fundraiser on her behalf. This week, Ms. James released the report that could end his political career.<br />The report, which found Mr. Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women and fostered a toxic workplace environment, marks a pivotal moment for Ms. James, a former ally of the governor. The release of the findings helps confirm her image of independence and boost her profile as attorney general, a role that has long been seen as a launchpad to higher office in New York.<br />Mr. Cuomo himself in recent weeks has voiced “concerns as to the independence of the reviewers.”<br />Former New York Attorney General Dennis Vacco, a Republican, said that elected prosecutors often face criticism—justified or not—that their conduct is politically motivated.<br />“She didn’t go looking for this Cuomo probe, but she stepped up at a time when the governor was trying to seize control of the narrative himself,” he said. “That took a lot of courage.”"
