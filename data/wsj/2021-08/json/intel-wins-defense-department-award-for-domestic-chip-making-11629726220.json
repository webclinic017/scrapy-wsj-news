    "body": "Intel Corp.  said it would provide commercial foundry services in the first phase of a broader Defense Department program that aims to build up domestic design and production of cutting-edge chips.<br />The chip maker on Monday said its foundry services unit will join with companies such as  International Business Machines Corp. ,  Synopsys Inc.,   Cadence Design Systems Inc.  and others as part of the RAMP-C program, which is short for Rapid Assured Microelectronics Prototypes - Commercial.<br />The program was designed to support a U.S.-based, chip-building ecosystem that could give the government agency access to technology and help secure its long-term needs for products, Intel said. The National Security Technology Accelerator, a nonprofit consortium that works with the Defense Department, didn’t respond to requests for comment about contract details.<br />Intel’s entry into the program comes as the U.S. government has been working to address a global semiconductor shortage. The Biden administration’s defense budget for the 2022 fiscal year includes a request for $2.3 billion for microelectronics efforts deemed critical to long-term national security.<br />The contract award will support Intel Foundry Services, which the company established as a stand-alone division earlier this year to produce Intel-design chips and those using other architectures."
