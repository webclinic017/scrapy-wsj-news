    "body": "A woman who accused former  Apollo Global Management Inc.  Chief Executive Leon Black of rape and defamation filed an amended complaint that alleges the private-equity titan was “best friends” with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and once flew her to Florida for a potential sexual encounter involving Epstein.<br />One of Mr. Black’s lawyers called the claims “demonstrably and transparently false.”<br />The allegations, filed Monday in a New York State court, are the latest claims to emerge in litigation started in June by Guzel Ganieva, a Russian immigrant and former model, who had a yearslong relationship with Mr. Black.<br />Ms. Ganieva has previously alleged that Mr. Black sexually abused her and forced her to sign a nondisclosure document in 2015 and then defamed her by claiming in media reports earlier this year that Ms. Ganieva had extorted him.<br />Mr. Black, whose attorneys have called Ms. Ganieva’s claims a “work of fiction,” has said he paid her millions of dollars, including $100,000 a month for many years, to keep their consensual affair from becoming public. In a prior court document, Mr. Black cited text messages and secretly recorded conversations with Ms. Ganieva that allegedly contradict her claims."
