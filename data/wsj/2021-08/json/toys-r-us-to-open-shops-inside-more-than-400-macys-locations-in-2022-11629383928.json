    "body": "Geoffrey the Giraffe is coming to  Macy’s .<br />Toys “R” Us will roll out shops at more than 400 Macy’s Inc. locations in the U.S. in 2022, the companies said, revamping the toy emporium’s U.S. brick-and-mortar presence since it filed for bankruptcy in 2017.<br />The return to physical retail locations marks another effort to revive Toys “R” Us’s footprint after two locations that opened in late 2019 in New Jersey and Texas closed in January because of the Covid-19 pandemic, leaving it without brick-and-mortar presence in the U.S.<br />For Macy’s, the move comes as it plans to quintuple the size of its toy business, which has been a strong but small part of the company’s operations, Macy’s Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said Thursday. He said customers who come to buy toys will likely buy other things as well, translating into additional sales for the department-store chain. The partnership will give it “the opportunity to go after the category with a lot more vigor,” Mr. Gennette said.<br />The companies said their partnership would also mean Macy’s customers will be able to buy Toys “R” Us products online with Macy’s digital and fulfillment system."
