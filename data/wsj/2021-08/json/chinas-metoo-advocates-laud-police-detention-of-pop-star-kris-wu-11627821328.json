    "body": "TAIPEI—China’s #MeToo advocates for accountability in cases of sexual misconduct have often run up against a state more concerned about preventing disturbances to public order.<br />Now, they see a breakthrough in the detention of one of China’s most recognizable movie stars.<br />Beijing police said late Saturday that they had detained Kris Wu, a pop star who is one of the country’s best-known celebrities, for what they called suspected rape. Authorities said they had responded to allegations that he repeatedly deceived young women into having sex with him.<br />The detention of Mr. Wu, a Chinese-Canadian singer and actor who is also known as Wu Yifan, was widely celebrated by Chinese internet users and even by Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily, which weighed in on its social-media account saying the more famous someone is, the more self-discipline they should exercise.<br />Before the police announcement, Mr. Wu denied the allegations and said he would willingly go to jail if they were true. A rape conviction in China usually results in between three and 10 years of prison. His lawyer and management company didn’t respond to requests for comment Sunday."
