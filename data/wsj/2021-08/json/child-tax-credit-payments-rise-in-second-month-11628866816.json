    "body": "The second monthly payment of child tax credits reached the households of nearly 61 million children, the Treasury Department said. That is a 2.7% increase from July, indicating that more people are being added to the program than are leaving through taxpayers’ decisions to opt out of the regular payments.<br />Friday’s payments of up to $300 per child totaled $15.4 billion, and they come as Democrats try to build political momentum to extend the expanded tax credit beyond its scheduled Dec. 31 expiration.<br />The March coronavirus-relief law expanded the credit in several ways. It raised the amount from $2,000 per child to $3,000 for children ages six to 17 and to $3,600 for those under six. Families with little or no income can now get the full amounts. Previously, those households were limited to getting $1,400 of the $2,000 credit. And it is delivered in the middle of every month instead of as part of the annual tax refund, creating something approaching a universal child allowance.<br />A Census Bureau survey released this week found that households with children reported having an easier time paying for food after the July payments were delivered.<br />Treasury Department officials also have been trying to make sure that eligible households sign up. That is a particular challenge for low-income families who don’t normally file tax returns."
