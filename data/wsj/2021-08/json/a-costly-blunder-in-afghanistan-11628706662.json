    "body": "I and more than two million fellow Vietnam veterans got a punch in the gut on the morning of April 30, 1975, when Saigon fell to the communist North Vietnamese Army and their Viet Cong guerrillas in the South. We abandoned our 10-year effort ignominiously, dumping Hueys off the deck of aircraft carriers. It made me sick. It was my 29th birthday.<br />Reading H.R. McMaster and Bradley Bowman’s op-ed “How to Avert Disaster in Afghanistan” (July 27) triggered the same pain. We Americans seem to have a knack for backing the losing side in wars all over the world, wasting our money, technology, political prestige and, most important, our young men and women. On April 14, the Biden administration pulled the plug on Kabul but denied that the Taliban would take Afghanistan. We could have prevented that by maintaining just a few strategic air bases to stick a finger in the eyes of enemies. Not doing so was a blunder. Did Mr. Biden et al. ever look at a world map? Now, we won’t have a major base for thousands of miles between Japan and Italy or Turkey. For Americans who served in Afghanistan, I am sorry for your punch in the gut.<br />Paul A. Scipione<br />Canandaigua, N.Y."
