    "body": "WASHINGTON—Top U.S. public-health officials on Sunday voiced support for Covid-19 vaccination mandates imposed at the local level, while the head of a national teachers union also backed such a move in schools.<br />“Mandates at the local level need to be done,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”<br />Dr. Fauci said that once Covid-19 vaccines receive full approval from the Food and Drug Administration, a step that he said he hoped would come in a few weeks, “you’re going to see the empowerment of local enterprises giving mandates. That could be colleges, universities, places of business—a whole variety—and I strongly support that.”<br />His comments and similar ones Sunday from Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, come as more businesses, schools and local entities have instituted vaccine requirements. “I celebrate when I see businesses deciding that they’re going to mandate that for their employees,” Dr. Collins said on ABC’s “This Week.”<br />The U.S., he said, was “paying a terrible price” with the surge in Covid-19 cases because about half the country hasn’t been fully vaccinated, and about 90 million eligible people haven’t gotten a single dose."
