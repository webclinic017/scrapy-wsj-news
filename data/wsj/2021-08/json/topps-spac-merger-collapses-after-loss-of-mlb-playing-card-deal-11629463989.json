    "body": "Topps Co.’s plan to go public in a blank-check merger has been derailed by new exclusive contracts Major League Baseball and its players’ union signed with a different trading-card company.<br />Topps, the leading baseball-card company since the 1950s, had reached a deal in April to become publicly traded through a merger with  Mudrick Capital Acquisition Corp. II ,  a special-purpose acquisition company. SPACs are shell companies that raise money on public markets and then merge with a private business to make the target company publicly traded.<br />The deal fell through by mutual agreement after MLB and the union representing its players both reached new exclusive licensing deals with Fanatics Inc., an online sports-merchandise retailer, starting in the coming years.<br />With the deal’s collapse, Topps will remain private, it said. The SPAC merger had been announced in April and would have valued the combined entity at about $1.16 billion.<br />“Topps expects to be able to produce substantially all its current licensed baseball products through 2025, pursuant to its existing agreements,” the company said Friday."
