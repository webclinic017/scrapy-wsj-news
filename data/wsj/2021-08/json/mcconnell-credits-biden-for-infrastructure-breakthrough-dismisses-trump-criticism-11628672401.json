    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell credited President Biden with helping to get the roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill passed in the Senate, but said he doesn’t anticipate many more opportunities for Republicans to work with Democrats.<br />In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, the Kentucky Republican also dismissed criticism from former President Donald Trump and other Republicans that he was handing Democrats a political victory ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.<br />“Infrastructure is popular with both Republicans and Democrats,” Mr. McConnell said. “The American people, divided, sent us a 50-50 Senate and a narrowly divided House. I don’t think the message from that was, ‘Do absolutely nothing.’ And if you’re going to find an area of potential agreement, I can’t think of a better one than infrastructure, which is desperately needed.”<br />The infrastructure bill, negotiated by a group of bipartisan senators, passed the Senate 69-30 on Tuesday. Mr. McConnell was one of 19 Senate Republicans who voted yes.<br />Without Mr. Biden’s support, centrist Democrats, led by Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, wouldn’t have been able to get the bill across the finish line, Mr. McConnell said."
