    "body": "It’s the dog days of summer, when nobody feels like doing much of anything except chilling out with a cold drink.<br />For many investors, every day is like that.<br />You’re probably sitting on some stock or fund you bought years or decades ago, which you know you should ditch but can’t be bothered even to think about. That isn’t the same as willful blindness, where you’ll defend an investment no matter what and attack anyone who suggests it might be wrong. This is more like benign neglect, where you know you’re wrong but don’t feel like doing anything about it.<br />It only seems benign, however. Sticking to the status quo is a great idea if your investment portfolio is perfect. Your portfolio isn’t perfect, though, is it?<br />Mine certainly isn’t."
