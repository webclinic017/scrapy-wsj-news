    "body": "<br /><br /><br />MIAMI—The Florida Board of Education on Friday threatened financial sanctions against two school districts that implemented mask mandates if they don’t comply within 48 hours with state law, intensifying the debate over masks in schools during the Covid-19 pandemic that is playing out in many states.<br />The school districts in Alachua County, home to Gainesville, and Broward County, which includes Fort Lauderdale and makes up the second-largest district in Florida, implemented mask mandates that didn’t allow for parents to opt out for their children. Instead, they required families to obtain authorization from a medical professional to get an exemption."
