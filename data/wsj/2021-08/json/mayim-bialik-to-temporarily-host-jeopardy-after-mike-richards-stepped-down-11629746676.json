    "body": "Actress Mayim Bialik will temporarily host “Jeopardy!,” taking over Mike Richards’s spot after the game show’s executive producer stepped down shortly after getting the coveted role.<br />Ms. Bialik and Mr. Richards were both hired in early August to host the show’s prime-time specials and spinoffs, after a lengthy search to replace Alex Trebek. Ms. Bialik is scheduled to tape 15 episodes when production resumes this week,  Sony  said.<br />Mr. Richards stepped down Friday after the Ringer reported on crass remarks and jokes he had made on a podcast of his about eight years ago.<br />The backlash from the revelations, particularly from “Jeopardy!” fans and former contestants persuaded Sony that it would be impossible for Mr. Richards to continue as host and prompted his decision to exit that role, according to a person familiar with the situation.<br />Mr. Richards had previously weathered controversy over his inside role in the hiring search and his involvement in past employment lawsuits. Mr. Richards had come under fire for his involvement in discrimination lawsuits during his tenure as executive producer of “The Price Is Right.” Fans have also expressed concern about a potential conflict of interest as Mr. Richards had helped facilitate the search for a new host."
