    "body": "Mike Richards is off “Jeopardy!” completely, fired from his job as executive producer of the long-running game show amid a controversy that led him to relinquish the role of full-time host less than two weeks ago.<br />“We had hoped that when Mike stepped down from the host position at Jeopardy! it would have minimized the disruption and internal difficulties we have all experienced these last few weeks. That clearly has not happened,” said Suzanne Prete, an executive on the show, in a memo to staff.<br />A representative for Mr. Richards declined to comment.<br />When Mr. Richards stepped down as host on Aug. 20, producer  Sony  Pictures Television publicly expressed confidence that he would be able to continue overseeing “Jeopardy!” and its staff. However, the scandal had damaged his standing behind the scenes, according to a person close to the show who said the controversy had compromised Mr. Richards’s ability to run one of the studio’s most valuable properties.<br />Along with his “Jeopardy!” post, Mr. Richards lost his job as executive producer of “Wheel of Fortune,” another long-running Sony game show, “effective immediately,” according to the memo from Ms. Prete, who serves as executive vice president, business and strategy, for both shows."
