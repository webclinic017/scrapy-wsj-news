    "body": "Get out your hankies for the latest Scarlett Johansson epic, a story of leverage lost and found.<br />Four years ago, the performer was getting ready to make her ninth and likely last Avengers film, “Black Widow.” She had muscle and she used it to extract from Marvel Studios a percentage of world-wide ticket sales. When the movie was in the can, her leverage declined precipitously as you would expect. The pandemic also happened. And the streaming wars.<br />Ignoring her representatives’ pleas,  Disney  released the film simultaneously on its new Disney+ service, charging an additional $30 to subscribers who already were paying $8 a month. This plainly displaced some volume of ticket sales.<br />She had another problem: Her contract with Marvel stipulated confidential arbitration in the event of dispute, but last week she sued parent Disney anyway, arguing that Disney induced Marvel to violate her deal and divert earnings to itself that she would have received from ticket proceeds. Voilà. Leverage restored, using her star power to cast a potential shadow over the film’s continuing box office as well as over Disney’s studied self-image.<br />Disney understood as much and answered in kind, albeit oafishly, saying her lawsuit was “especially sad and distressing in its callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.”"
