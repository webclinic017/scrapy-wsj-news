    "body": "U.S. stock futures edged up Thursday ahead of new data on the trade deficit and unemployment claims that could provide fresh insights into the pace of the economic recovery.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 ticked up 0.3%, pointing to modest gains at the opening bell after the broad market index closed down 0.5% on Wednesday. Nasdaq-100 futures also gained 0.3%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures advanced 0.2%.<br />The major stock indexes have wobbled in recent days amid concerns that the rebound may be slowing and the Delta variant of Covid-19 is leading to a surge in cases. Fresh data Wednesday showed that the private sector added half as many jobs in July as economists expected. Despite the volatility, the S&P 500 is still hovering near its all-time high, boosted by strong quarterly results from the biggest businesses.<br />“We’re pretty positive, we think that the earnings data is very strong,” said Caroline Simmons, U.K. chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. Equity markets can continue to climb by 5% to 10% over the next year, she said.<br />The continued signs of weakness in the labor market also suggests that the Federal Reserve will hold off on scaling back its easy money policies for now, Ms. Simmons added."
