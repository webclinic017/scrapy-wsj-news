    "body": "President Biden has had an easy time getting even his most partisan nominees through the Democratic Senate. But an exception could be Catherine Lhamon to be assistant secretary for civil rights at the Education Department.<br />Mr. Biden wants her to come back for an encore in the same job she held in the Obama Administration as the top enforcer of Title IX. But last week the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions failed to advance Ms. Lhamon’s nomination after an 11-11 vote along party lines.<br />That doesn’t kill Ms. Lhamon’s confirmation, but it is a warning sign. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will have to discharge her nomination from committee to get it to the Senate floor. Ms. Lhamon failed to gain a single GOP vote in a committee that includes Mitt Romney, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski.<br />In the Obama years, Ms. Lhamon used informal guidance to erode due process for college students accused of sexual assault or harassment. Former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos restored some basic fairness with a Title IX rule that allows both parties to cross-examine witnesses and challenge evidence, among other reforms. Ms. Lhamon denounced this as a return “to the bad old days, that predate my birth, when it was permissible to rape and sexually harass students with impunity.” In a hearing last month, she expressed no regret for such demagoguery.<br />Democratic Sens. Kyrsten Sinema, Joe Manchin, Mark Kelly and Maggie Hassan have a revealing choice to make. Mr. Manchin voted in March for an amendment to the American Rescue Plan that would have defunded schools that allow transgender students to participate in women’s athletics. But Ms. Lhamon supports Biden Administration guidance that could give her the power to enforce transgender entry to women’s dorms, bathrooms and sports teams."
