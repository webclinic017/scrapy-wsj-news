    "body": "Facing a now-inevitable Delta-variant surge in the spread of Covid-19, Americans stand divided, not united.<br />Some 100 million adults who are eligible to be vaccinated haven’t been, government leaders say, and getting them to decide to get a stick is the key to changing current, troubling trend lines. Yet many of them still refuse to believe in the need for vaccination, and don’t trust the political messengers pleading with them to change their minds. Vaccine mandates are about to replace mask mandates as a new battle line.<br />It’s hard to escape the feeling that America is battling two diseases: Covid-19 and mistrust.<br />In the face of the pandemic’s polarizing politics, the two forces holding the best hope for breaking through this roadblock may be the private sector—the business community in particular—and the day-to-day conversations Americans have with those they most trust. The power these forces display in the next couple of weeks will be key in determining how hard and long this new phase of the pandemic proves to be.<br />There was a time, 16 months ago, when it was possible to think the coronavirus might pull the country together, politically and socially, in a united response. That simply has never happened. Misinformation about the severity of crisis followed by pitched battles over masks, economic shutdowns and school openings have turned Covid-19 into a political football."
