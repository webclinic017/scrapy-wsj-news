    "body": "Inflation is cooling down, but that doesn’t mean it is about to go cold.<br />The Labor Department on Wednesday reported that its measure of consumer prices rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in July from a month earlier—a smaller gain than June’s 0.9% increase—putting it 5.4% above its year-earlier level. Much of that gain was driven by price increases in food and fuel. Core prices, which exclude food and energy prices in an effort to better capture inflation’s trend, rose 0.3% in July from a month earlier after rising 0.9% in June.<br />A big part of why the core reading moderated last month was that used-car prices, which had been a significant driver of inflation over the past several months, have finally begun to ease. By the Labor Department’s measure, they rose just 0.2% in July from a month earlier after surging 10.7% in June.<br />Further cooling may be in the offing: A used-car price index from auction company Manheim, which the Labor Department data tend to lag behind, slipped 2.6% in July from June.<br />Used-car prices are just one of the many elements of inflation that seem likely to cool off as shortages and supply-chain bottlenecks get resolved. It could be a drawn-out process, though. The semiconductor shortage that has hampered new-car manufacturing hasn’t gone away, and though auto companies’ production schedules suggest they will be making more cars in the months ahead, inventory levels don’t look likely to fully recover until some time next year."
