    "body": "For many families, summer vacation 2021 was anything but relaxing.<br />As travel picked up again, extended families reunited. Grandparents hugged grandchildren, adult siblings caught up in-person, and long-separated cousins played together on beaches and in playgrounds.<br />For families coming together again after more than 18 months of the pandemic, though, those reunions are often emotionally heightened events. Call it the obligation vacation: relatives reuniting while emotionally depleted.<br />Aging parents are eager for adult children to help with overdue home-improvement tasks. An aunt wants to see the baby. Siblings recall old rivalries. It isn’t a relaxing break—and lately it’s been happening as the Delta variant gains footing.<br />Travel has picked up: So far in August, nearly two million passengers have passed through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints each day on average—more than twice the rate a year earlier, but still below 2019 levels."
