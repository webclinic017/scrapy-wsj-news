The prosperity and countercultural optimism of the 1960s had been replaced by high inflation, surging unemployment and a rising divorce rate. For many teens, the album “Who’s Next” by the Who captured the uncertainty of hard times and dashed hopes in a rusting America and Britain.<br />Released 50 years ago on Aug. 14, the fifth studio album by the Who is arguably the English band’s most dynamic and poignant work. Surprisingly, Polydor, the album’s label, is not celebrating its anniversary this summer with a boxed set.<br />In 1971, songs such as “Won’t Get Fooled Again” and “Behind Blue Eyes” became AM-radio hits in the U.S., while “Baba O’Riley” was an FM favorite, helping push the album to No. 4 on the Billboard chart. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2007."
