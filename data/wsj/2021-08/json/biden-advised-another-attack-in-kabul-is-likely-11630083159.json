    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden’s national security advisers told him on Friday that another terrorist attack is likely as the U.S. wraps up its withdrawal from Afghanistan, according to the White House.<br />During a meeting in the White House Situation Room, the president’s advisers said they are taking steps to protect U.S. troops on the ground at Kabul’s international airport, adding that the next few days will likely be the most dangerous yet, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.<br />The Friday morning briefing came one day after an attack outside the airport—which the Pentagon blamed on an Islamic State affiliate known as ISIS-K—killed 13 members of the U.S. armed services and nearly 200 Afghans.<br />In response to the attack, Mr. Biden asked his military commanders to draw up plans to retaliate against ISIS-K. Military commanders told Mr. Biden on Friday that they had the necessary resources to conduct operations targeting the group, Ms. Psaki said.<br />The president intends to order the killing of those involved in Thursday’s attack, Ms. Psaki said: “I think he made clear yesterday that he does not want them to live on the Earth anymore.”"
