    "body": "Amid the rise in Covid-19 cases caused by the Delta variant, the largest rental assistance program in U.S. history has distributed just $4.7 billion of the nearly $47 billion in federal emergency funds as of July 31, according to the latest data released by the Treasury Department.<br />Following the latest ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court overturning the federal eviction moratorium, evictions will be able to resume around the country where rental aid has slowly trickled out, modestly increasing to $1.7 billion from $1.5 billion in June. Some localities have their own moratoriums in place.<br />While the Treasury Department is overseeing the program, it is up to the states and local governments to set up systems to process applications, screen tenants and distribute aid. The amount that has been disbursed varies greatly by state. Emergency funds are allocated to each state based on their populations.<br /><br />Money began to trickle out to renters in January, but more than half of the payments states have reported didnâ€™t occur until June."
