    "body": "Boeing Co.  named a new top engineer for its commercial aircraft division, as the unit works to overcome design setbacks and faces increased regulatory scrutiny.<br />The Chicago-based plane maker said in an internal memo on Monday that Howard McKenzie, the top engineer in its services unit, would succeed Lynne Hopper as chief engineer in its commercial aircraft unit that designs and produces passenger and cargo jets.<br />Now, Ms. Hopper will manage the company’s engineering strategy and operations group, which is focused on designs based on digital models. She succeeds in that role longtime Boeing engineer Pat Schirmer, who is retiring this fall, according to the company.<br />A Boeing spokeswoman said the timing of the moves wasn’t related to an Aug. 19 letter from the Federal Aviation Administration, which informed Boeing that the agency was reviewing reports of Boeing employees facing company pressures in their work on safety matters for the agency. The company said it took the concerns seriously and would work with the FAA.<br />The Boeing spokeswoman said Ms. Hopper’s appointment was a lateral move, and that the reshuffling wasn’t related to various other recent engineering issues facing Boeing’s commercial division over the past year."
