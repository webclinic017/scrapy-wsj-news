    "body": "The blow to America’s reputation from the botched Afghanistan withdrawal is compounded by the fact that the Administration executing it is pushing for a real reduction in America’s defense spending. The message is that the U.S. is retreating from security commitments worldwide.<br />When the executive falters in foreign policy, Congress can sometimes help right the ship. The Senate Armed Services Committee this summer added $25 billion to Mr. Biden’s $715 billion Pentagon proposal, turning the proposed 1.6% nominal increase into a 5% increase—insufficient, in our view, but at least outpacing inflation.<br />The House Democratic caucus has other ideas, however. Twenty-seven Members have sent a letter to House Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith calling for him to stand by the Biden cut to the U.S. military.<br />“We request that the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 . . . not exceed an authorization level larger than the level requested in President Biden’s budget submission to Congress,” they write. One argument: “America’s largest national security threat is a global pandemic.” Not climate change?<br />These progressive Democrats have won the fight in their party on domestic spending. The needed investments in the U.S. Navy and missile deterrents are minuscule compared to the trillions going to entitlements. And Democrats in swing districts should be worried that the Afghanistan surrender will again tar Democrats as weak on national security."
