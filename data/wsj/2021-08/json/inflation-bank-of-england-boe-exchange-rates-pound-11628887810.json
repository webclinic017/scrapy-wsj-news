    "body": "Your editorial “Everyone Else Gets Fed Up” (Aug. 6) accepts that the Bank of England may not be able to tighten monetary policy to curb inflation unless it is joined by other central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the  Bank of Japan .  Otherwise, you argue, raising rates will attract capital flows and appreciate the pound.<br />That’s precisely how the process is supposed to work: When a central bank tightens policy, the currency rises and import prices fall, putting downward pressure on domestic inflation. In fact, if other central banks were to raise interest rates at the same time, this would neutralize the effect of the policy tightening on the currency and reduce its effectiveness in curtailing prices.<br />The beauty of floating exchange rates is that central banks can act independent of each other, calibrating their policies to their own domestic circumstances. If and when the Bank of England decides it’s time to start tightening, it shouldn’t wait for other central banks to join it—it should just do it.<br />Steven Kamin<br />American Enterprise Institute"
