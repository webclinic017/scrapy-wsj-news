    "body": "The Biden administration released its proposal Wednesday for overhauling the asylum system, aiming to speed up the time it takes for asylum-seekers to receive decisions and to reduce a growing backlog of pending cases.<br />The proposed rule would allow U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services asylum officers to hear and decide applications for migrants. Currently, cases are assigned to immigration courts.<br />The southern border recently saw its busiest month in 21 years, with Border Patrol making about 200,000 arrests in July, according to figures released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection last week.<br />With the surge in migrants crossing the border, the backlog of pending cases in immigration courts has been growing. There are 1.4 million pending cases at these courts, according to a tracking tool at Syracuse University.<br />Quicker decisions on asylum cases would likely mean faster deportations for those whose cases are denied. It also could curb the incentive for migrants without valid claims for humanitarian protection to come, since their opportunity to live and work in the U.S. during the time it takes to wrap up their cases would be significantly reduced."
