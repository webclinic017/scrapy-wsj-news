    "body": "ABC News President Kim Godwin told staffers on a conference call Thursday that she has requested an independent investigation into how the network handled allegations of sexual assault against the former executive producer of “Good Morning America.”<br />The comments came a day after a lawsuit was filed that alleged the producer, Michael Corn, sexually assaulted a current ABC News staffer and a former staffer in separate incidents. Mr. Corn denied wrongdoing and called the allegations fabrications. In response to a request for comment Thursday on the call for an ABC probe, a lawyer for Mr. Corn referred to his previous statement.<br />“We can’t have us investigating us. We need an independent person,” Ms. Godwin said, according to a recording of the conference call. “The process has to be independent.”<br />The lawsuit also named  Walt Disney  Co. ’s ABC as a defendant, saying the company didn’t adequately respond to complaints of alleged misconduct by Mr. Corn from several women.<br />On the call, Ms. Godwin said the ABC News staffers who were involved in handling complaints against Mr. Corn would get due process, but their role would be probed."
