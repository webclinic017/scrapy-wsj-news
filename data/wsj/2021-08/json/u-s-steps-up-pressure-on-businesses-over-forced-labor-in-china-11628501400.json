    "body": "WASHINGTON—U.S. lawmakers and Biden administration officials are stepping up pressure on American businesses to stop imports from the Western Chinese region of Xinjiang as Beijing’s alleged use of forced labor emerges as a top item on their bilateral trade agenda.<br />Western officials say the Chinese government uses forced labor of Uyghur and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, the world’s leading producer of cotton and raw materials used in solar panels. Beijing strongly denies the claim.<br />Imports of cotton and tomato products have already been effectively banned since January, and penalties on purchases of some solar materials were implemented in June.<br />Tougher restrictions are afoot. Congress is expected to approve legislation later this year that would prohibit imports of all products from Xinjiang unless the importer can prove their items are free of forced labor—a high bar.<br />The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act passed the Senate by unanimous consent last month and is awaiting approval by the House, which passed a similar bill by a wide bipartisan vote last year."
