    "body": "BlackRock Inc.  and other heavyweight investors were more willing to flex their muscles against companies in the past year, setting the stage for future showdowns over issues from board seats to climate-change disclosure.<br />BlackRock funds withheld support from 10% of board directors on company shareholder ballots, or more than 6,500 director election proposals, in the year ended in June.<br />That is up from 8.5% in the prior year. In addition, the world’s largest asset manager increased support for shareholder-led proposals. It backed 64% of environmental proposals, up from 11% during the prior year.<br />BlackRock cast key votes alongside other big investors in signature shareholder battles that forced companies to make changes.<br />Earlier this year, BlackRock, Vanguard Group and California pensions joined others in backing dissident directors at one of America’s most-prominent companies,  Exxon Mobil Corp.  It was the culmination of yearslong frustration over the oil major’s handling of shareholder feedback."
