He said the company is discussing building similar plants with countries in Europe and Asia, though he declined to say which ones.<br />Under the agreement with Canada, the plant will fulfill Canadian orders for Moderna mRNA vaccines, including Covid-19 booster shots and other vaccines that the company is developing, Mr. Bancel said.<br />The factory will be similar to the company’s main manufacturing facility in Norwood, Mass., and will likely employ a couple of hundred people, he said.<br />The location of the factory hasn’t been determined. The company and the government said construction could be completed by the end of 2024. Canada’s Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne said that Canada agreed to acquire a set number of vaccines that Moderna will produce from the plant, to help lure the company.
