    "body": "A recent Middle Seat column by Scott McCartney explored the limited rights customers have when dealing with airlines. We asked readers to submit their own ideas for a Passenger Bill of Rights, and more than 300 responded. Here are some of the most common suggestions.<br />Readers called for greater refund options when faced with a delay or inconvenience by an airline. Many readers requested the ability to force airlines to rebook flights with other carriers if the next flight time with the original airline is much later.<br />“If a flight is canceled or significantly delayed and causes the customer to miss a connecting flight, the airline should compensate the customer for their additional expenses,” wrote one reader, echoing similar sentiments of dozens of submissions. “Expenses should include having to rebook on another airline, car rental, hotel and meals.”<br />Several requested a ban on overbooking flights and the subsequent bumping of would-be passengers to the next available flight. “One seat—one ticket,” a reader wrote.<br />William Durkin, 26 years old, of Raleigh, N.C., wrote that he understands that airlines overbook flights to maximize revenue and prevent losses in the case of seat cancellations, but he believes it’s an unfair practice that should be stopped."
