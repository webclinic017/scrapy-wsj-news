    "body": "When the U.S. withdraws the last of its military forces from Afghanistan next week, at least one American is expected to be left behind: Mark Frerichs, a contractor abducted last year by Afghan militants.<br />The Taliban have held a number of Westerners over the last two decades as hostages, but Mr. Frerichs is believed to be the last American detained by the group that now controls Afghanistan.<br />With the U.S. military withdrawal entering its final phase, Mr. Frerichs’s family is pushing President Biden to cut a deal to free the Illinois-born civil engineer.<br />“Mr. President, you said ‘Any American who wants to come home, we will get you home,’” said Charlene Cakora, Mr. Frerichs’s sister, in a statement. “That should include my brother, Mark. My family needs your help to bring Mark home safely and you have the power to make it happen. Please help us.”<br />Mr. Frerichs had lived in Kabul for a decade, working on various development projects, when he was abducted in January 2020 in the capital city, according to U.S. officials. His captors soon turned him over to the Haqqani network, one of the more brutal groups working under the Taliban umbrella."
