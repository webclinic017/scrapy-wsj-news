    "body": "Britney Spears’s lawyer is moving swiftly in an attempt to remove her father, James Spears, from the conservatorship that has ruled her life and finances for the past 13 years.<br />In a request filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Thursday, Greenberg Traurig LLP’s Mathew Rosengart is asking Judge Brenda Penny to move up the date of a Sept. 29 hearing, saying that Ms. Spears’s emotional and financial well-being would benefit from an expedited review of her petition last month to remove her father from the conservatorship. If the court can’t advance the hearing, his request said, Mr. Spears should be immediately suspended as conservator of Ms. Spears’s finances.<br />“Ms. Spears’ emotional health and well-being must be, and are, the paramount concern,” the filing said.<br />Mr. Rosengart is requesting the hearing be set at the earliest date possible on or after Aug. 23. This is Mr. Rosengart’s second request to expedite the hearing. A judge earlier granted his request to move it to September from mid-December.<br />A former federal prosecutor and high-profile litigator, Mr. Rosengart was hired by Ms. Spears in July following her two emotional testimonies on June 23. He declined to comment."
