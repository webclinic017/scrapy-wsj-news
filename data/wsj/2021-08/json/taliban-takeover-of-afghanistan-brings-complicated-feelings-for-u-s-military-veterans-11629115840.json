    "body": "U.S. Army veteran Sean Lee wasn’t necessarily surprised to see the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan during the past week. Instead, he was surprised at his own subdued reaction.<br />“I’m far more apathetic than I thought I would be,” said the retired Sergeant First Class. “I did not have the hope for Afghanistan that I did for Iraq.”<br />In the past week the Taliban have swept through the country, taking control of every provincial capital. On Sunday, the Taliban captured the capital city of Kabul, sending Afghan President Ashraf Ghani into exile and prompting the U.S. Embassy to evacuate.<br />Many veterans are left wondering if it was all worth it, and the answer isn’t always clear.<br />Some have wanted the U.S. to pull out of the country for years, while others would have supported a continued U.S. presence indefinitely. But many seem to agree that ending America’s longest conflict by apparently capitulating to the Taliban isn’t the way they wanted to see the U.S. leave Afghanistan."
