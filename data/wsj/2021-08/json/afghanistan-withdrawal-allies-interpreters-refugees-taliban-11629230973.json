    "body": "Regarding “The Afghan Allies Left Behind” (Review & Outlook, Aug. 16): My interpreter, whom I’ll call Karim, served side by side with us in Afghanistan on special-operations missions. He risked his life to support U.S. troops, fighting with us to reduce the Taliban presence and capture their leaders. While my unit fought on nine-month deployments, Karim fought alongside Americans for years straight, from 2012 to 2020.<br />Together, we spent six years fighting for a Special Immigrant Visa. Karim’s application was relegated to the fatal status of “awaiting processing.” Now, Karim and I have been in contact every 12 hours since the fall of Herat, sharing information and searching for a way out. He fled to the Kabul area with his wife and children. Karim has had to destroy all his documents as the Taliban have begun hunting down our allies. He’s now a refugee in his own country, carrying all his worldly possessions, praying that he can hide and escape the Taliban.<br />The window for his and thousands of others’ evacuation is closing fast. If we fail them it will be the greatest betrayal of U.S. foreign policy in my generation.<br />Sgt. Peter James Kiernan, USMC<br />New York"
