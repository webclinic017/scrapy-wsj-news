    "body": "AT&T Inc.  is nearing a deal to sell TMZ to  Fox Corp. , after a year of talks that involved persuading Harvey Levin to sign off on a sale of the gossip news platform he co-founded, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The terms being negotiated would value TMZ, which includes a popular website and daily television show, at between $100 million and $125 million, the people said. While the on-again, off-again talks have heated up recently, people on both sides stressed there is no guarantee a deal will be reached.<br />Fox already has deep ties to TMZ and Mr. Levin. Its local TV stations carry the daily “TMZ on TV” program, and Mr. Levin also has produced and hosted a show for Fox News called “OBJECTified.”<br />Despite the long-term relationship, Mr. Levin and his team needed to be persuaded on supporting a sale to Fox, according to people at both Fox and AT&T’s WarnerMedia unit that oversees TMZ.<br />Among Mr. Levin’s concerns was how much editorial control he would have at Fox. Mr. Levin has very little interference from WarnerMedia executives, people close to WarnerMedia said."
