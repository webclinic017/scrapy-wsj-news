    "body": "Beijing delayed plans for a new law that could bar banks and companies in Hong Kong from complying with sanctions on China’s people, reflecting caution about a measure that has sent a wave of concern through the city’s business community.<br />China’s legislature had planned to implement new laws in Hong Kong and Macau mirroring the antiforeign sanctions law that was passed on the mainland in June in response to a series of restrictive measures imposed by the U.S. and Europe. But in an unexpected move, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress decided not to press ahead for now while it studies the issue, Tam Yiu-chung, a Hong Kong delegate to the panel, said Friday.<br />The delay is a reprieve for companies that had feared the Catch-22 of violating Chinese law by upholding sanctions or violating U.S. law by not doing so.<br />Beijing was concerned the legislation could further shake business and investor confidence, which has already plummeted amid China’s regulatory crackdown on the technology sector and others, people familiar with the discussions said. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index is down 8.75% this year.<br />China is still eager to implement the law in the city, but is likely to revise some of its terms to avoid scaring away international capital, one of the people said."
