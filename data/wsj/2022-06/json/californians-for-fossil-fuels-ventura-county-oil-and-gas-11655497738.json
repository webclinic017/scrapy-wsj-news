    "body": "Is the progressive tide in California starting to recede? Voters in San Francisco and Los Angeles last week repudiated soft-on-crime policies. In two local referenda that drew less attention, voters in coastal Ventura County northwest of L.A. rejected new restrictions on oil and gas development.<br />The county Board of Supervisors in November 2020 approved two land-use amendments that would have erected new regulatory barriers to drilling for energy producers with decades-old permits. Drilling is primarily regulated by federal and state governments. But counties in California can impose additional regulations."
