    "body": "The Securities and Exchange Commission and a court-appointed monitor overseeing GPB Capital Holdings LLC are recommending a receivership to protect nearly $1 billion of investor assets and prevent GPB founder and owner David Gentile from reasserting control over the firm that has been likened to a Ponzi scheme by regulators.<br />Joseph Gardemal, the monitor, said in a court filing that a receiver would reduce the financial drain from a management arrangement set up by Mr. Gentile before he resigned as chief executive of the private-equity firm last year, following fraud allegations by the SEC. Mr. Gardemal also said a receivership would help accelerate distributions to investors who have waited since at least 2018 for their money."
