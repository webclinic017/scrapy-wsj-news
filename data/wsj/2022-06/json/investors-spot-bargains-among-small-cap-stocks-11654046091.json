    "body": "Shares of smaller U.S. companies have taken a drubbing in the market selloff. Some investors say they are starting to see a deal.<br />The Russell 2000 benchmark of small-cap stocks has fallen 24% from its November record, beginning its decline almost two months before the S&P 500 index of large-cap companies. The S&P 500 is down 12% over the same period, dragged lower as investors realized that red-hot inflation was sticking around and that the Federal Reserve would likely raise interest rates more aggressively than had been expected."
