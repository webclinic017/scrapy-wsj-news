    "body": "Our healthcare system is off the rails. Primary-care appointments set for 2023 are the norm. Disrupted supply chains are creating shortages in everything from local anesthetic to cancer treatments. And the solution? Add oil to the fire by expanding already misguided ObamaCare subsidies (“When ‘Temporary’ Subsidies Are Forever,” Review & Outlook, May 31).<br />It’s time to tell the truth. Middlemen make up an astonishing 73% of healthcare spending—one-third of every tax dollar. GPOs and PBMs, in collusion with insurers, raise prices but restrict access. They are protected by a 1987 safe-harbor law that exempts them from oversight."
