    "body": "Kazakhstan is an exception: a post-Soviet Central Asian state embarking on a path of democratization and liberalization in a region dominated by authoritarian neighbors.<br />On Sunday the country held a referendum—its first in 27 years—on potential amendments to the constitution. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said the changes, which are projected to pass, according to exit polls, would bring an end to the “super presidential” system and ultimately usher in a “Second Republic.” His predecessor, Nursultan Nazarbayev, held office for almost 30 years."
