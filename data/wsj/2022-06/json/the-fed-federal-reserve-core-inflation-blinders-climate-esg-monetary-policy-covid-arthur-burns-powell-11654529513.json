    "body": "Alan Blinder writes that “the Fed can’t do anything about food and energy prices” (“Inflation Isn’t Transitory, but It Isn’t Permanent Either,” op-ed, June 2). That may have been true before, but the Federal Reserve is now knee-deep in the murky waters of climate change, energy policy and sustainability.<br />In 2020 the Fed joined the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System, a group of central banks whose “purpose is to help strengthening [sic] the global response required to meet the goals of the Paris agreement and to enhance the role of the financial system to manage risks and to mobilize capital for green and low-carbon investments in the broader context of environmentally sustainable development.”"
