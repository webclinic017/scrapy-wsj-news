    "body": "When we talk about black history, the first images that come to mind often reflect the brutality of slavery. We need to remember that brutality, but we should also remember the resistance to slavery, which was ultimately successful. These heroic black figures from the past teach us that we all have the capacity to succeed, even against extraordinary odds.<br />Bridget Mason, later nicknamed Biddy, was born in 1818 as a slave to a Mississippi man named Robert Smith. After walking 1,800 miles to follow Smith to California, she successfully sued him for her freedom. As a free woman, Biddy worked as a midwife and nurse, carefully saving all she could. She used her savings to buy land in the rapidly growing city of Los Angeles. She eventually became the wealthiest and most influential black American west of the Mississippi, and she used her fortune to fund charities and serve the poor."
