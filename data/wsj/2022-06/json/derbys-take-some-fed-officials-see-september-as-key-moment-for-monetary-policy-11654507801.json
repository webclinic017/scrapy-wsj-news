    "body": "With Federal Reserve officials draining a great deal of the drama out of the next two policy meetings, their September meeting is shaping up to be the key pivot point for the next stage of interest-rate policy changes.<br />Over recent weeks, a range of central bankers have argued that to lower inflation, they will almost certainly implement half-percentage-point increases at the June and July Federal Open Market Committee meetings. With the Fed having already lifted its target by three-quarters of a percentage point this year, that will have the funds rate target range at between 1.75% and 2% by the end of the July gathering."
