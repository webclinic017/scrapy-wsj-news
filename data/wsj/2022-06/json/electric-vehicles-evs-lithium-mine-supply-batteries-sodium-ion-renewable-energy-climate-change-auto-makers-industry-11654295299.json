    "body": "Does Russ Andrews (“Electric Vehicles Are on a Bridge to Nowhere,” Letters, May 26) believe that Henry Ford should have had second thoughts about mass-producing autos because there weren’t enough refineries making gas or enough miles of paved roads for them to roll on?<br />Obviously not. New products don’t wait until all the elements are in place to provide for growth. They create demand and opportunities for supporting industries to start and grow. Lithium is in short supply because it wasn’t in great demand. But now it is, and the price will go up, which will motivate entrepreneurs all over the world to start mining and processing. It’s already happening."
