    "body": "Inflation is rampant, the Federal Reserve seems prepared to raise interest rates even higher than previously expected, financial markets are reeling, and rumors of recession are in the air. All of this signals economic pain ahead, and how much pain will depend on whether Washington avoids more of the policy mistakes that got us into this mess.<br />A recession is by no means certain, especially with a strong job market and consumers still flush from pandemic government payments. But inflation is sapping consumer confidence, with the Michigan sentiment survey falling to 50.2 in June from 58.4 in May, and from 85.5 a year ago. The more consumers believe that their real earnings will keep falling, the less theyâ€™ll spend to keep the economy afloat."
