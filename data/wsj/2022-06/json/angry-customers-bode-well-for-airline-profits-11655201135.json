    "body": "For many industries, spiraling inflation and lines of angry customers are usually an ill omen for the bottom line. Airlines could be a glaring exception.<br />Fliers aren’t happy: Just as most pandemic restrictions end, thousands of flights are being canceled or delayed—a result of carriers around the world letting too many employees go during the Covid-19 crisis—and ticket prices are surging. In the U.S., airfares rose 38% in May relative to a year earlier, according to Friday’s inflation report. They helped push the broader consumer-price index up by 8.6%, the fastest pace since December 1981."
