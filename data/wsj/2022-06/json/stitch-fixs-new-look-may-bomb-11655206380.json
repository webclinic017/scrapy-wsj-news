    "body": "Stitch Fix ’s  run as an exclusive online styling company is ending. Its future as a more traditional e-tailer looks even worse.<br />Stitch Fix’s fall from the heavens has been nothing short of spectacular, even in today’s market. Since briefly touching highs of over $10 billion in early 2021, Stitch Fix’s market value has fallen by more than 90% to well under $1 billion as of Friday."
