    "body": "Anthony Albanese has been Australia’s Prime Minister for less than a month, but China is already testing whether he’ll stand up to intimidation as well as his predecessor did. Australia said Sunday that on May 26 a Chinese fighter jet intercepted an Australian surveillance aircraft conducting a routine mission in international airspace near the South China Sea.<br />Australia’s Defense Ministry said the Chinese jet pulled alongside the aircraft, then moved in front, releasing flares and chaff that “resulted in a dangerous maneuver which posed a safety threat” to the Australian plane and its crew. Australia lodged a complaint with Beijing, but this was probably no accident."
