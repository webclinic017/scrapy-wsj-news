    "body": "In the sea of “Metamates,” Sheryl Sandberg is either jumping ship or is being pushed overboard. Either way, the company formerly known as Facebook—under a new name and bound for a new destination—has the same captain. And he will be fully responsible for the voyage from this point onward.<br />In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Ms. Sandberg said she was stepping down from her role as  Meta ’s  chief operating officer after 14 years at the company. Her stated reason was to focus more on her family and philanthropic work, but the move comes at a delicate time for an advertising business that she headed—and still accounts for 97% of the company’s revenue."
