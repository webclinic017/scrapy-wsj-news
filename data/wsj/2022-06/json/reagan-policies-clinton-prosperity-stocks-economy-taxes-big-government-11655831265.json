    "body": "William Galston waxes about the glories of Bill Clinton’s eight years in the White House in “Bill Clinton’s Recipe for Economic Growth” (Politics & Ideas, May 18). But prosperity came during his presidency only because Mr. Clinton capitulated to Ronald Reagan’s common-sense conservatism.<br />Mr. Clinton’s first two years in office ended in electoral disaster. Determined to go on a high-tax, big-spend binge after winning the presidency, he narrowly won a major income-tax increase in the Democratic-controlled Congress. Congressional Republicans were instrumental in blocking many of his other expensive initiatives."
