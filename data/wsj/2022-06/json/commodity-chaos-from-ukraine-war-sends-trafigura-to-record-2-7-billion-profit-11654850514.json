    "body": "Trading house Trafigura Group rode chaotic moves in commodity markets, worsened by Russiaâ€™s war on Ukraine, to score record profit.<br />The privately held commodities merchant earned $2.7 billion in net profit on $170.6 billion in revenue in the six months through March, it said Friday. Profit was 29% higher than in the same period a year earlier, making Trafigura a winner from a stretch of massive volatility in energy and metal prices. Two-thirds of revenue came from trading oil and other forms of energy."
