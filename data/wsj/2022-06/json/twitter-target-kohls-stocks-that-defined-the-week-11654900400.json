    "body": "Twitter Inc.<br />Elon Musk is ruffling feathers at Twitter. The  Tesla  CEO threatened Monday to end his $44 billion deal to buy the social-media company, saying in a letter that the company didn’t comply with requests for data about spam and fake accounts. Twitter said it would continue to share information with Mr. Musk. That same day, Texas also launched an investigation of Twitter’s tally of fake bot accounts. Twitter shares lost 1.5% Monday."
