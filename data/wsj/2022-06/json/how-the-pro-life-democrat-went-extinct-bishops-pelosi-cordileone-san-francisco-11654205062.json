    "body": "San Francisco’s Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone recently announced that he would block House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Catholic, from receiving communion in her hometown over her support for abortion. This was a welcome decision, and it’s far from unprecedented. Yet bishops from other dioceses often undermine such appropriate actions as these, and it’s no wonder so many Catholic Democrats enthusiastically support abortion.<br />Following action earlier this year by the House, the Senate recently voted on the Women’s Health Protection Act, a bill that would go far beyond Roe v. Wade by codifying into federal law the most extreme pro-abortion measures. Twelve out of 23 Catholics in the Senate voted for the bill, all of whom are Democrats. Seventy-six out of 134 Catholics in the House voted for it, all of whom, again, are Democrats."
