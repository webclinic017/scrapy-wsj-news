    "body": "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine makes this week’s NATO summit one of the most important in years, and so far mostly good. Turkey finally dropped its opposition to Finland and Sweden joining the alliance, which is also buttressing its military capability against the Russian threat.<br />“We met, we discussed and we found a good solution,” said NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. The leaders of all three countries signed a document in which Helsinki and Stockholm vowed to cooperate with Ankara in its fight against Kurdish terrorism. The memorandum also said that “there are no national arms embargoes” between the three countries."
