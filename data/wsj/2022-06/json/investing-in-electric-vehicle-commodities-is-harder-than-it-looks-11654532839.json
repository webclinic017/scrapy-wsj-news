    "body": "Nickel  might be a good investment given the rise of electric vehicles and the time it takes to bring on new supply. What that means for your portfolio is another question.<br />Hedge fund Elliott Management wants $456 million from the London Metal Exchange for its cancellation of trades during the spectacular short squeeze that followed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The LME’s owner, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, is fighting the lawsuit. Officially, nickel hit a 15-year high of about $48,000 a metric ton on the exchange on March 8, according to FactSet. But that excludes roughly $4 billion worth of canceled trades at much steeper prices."
