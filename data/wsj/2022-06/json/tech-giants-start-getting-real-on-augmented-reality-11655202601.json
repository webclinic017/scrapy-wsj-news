    "body": "The deepest pockets of big tech keep learning that augmented reality is a real-world pain. Thinking a little smaller might pay off bigger.<br />Take the company once known as  Facebook .  Less than nine months after going big on the metaverse, the company now known as Meta Platforms is reportedly shelving plans to release commercial AR glasses.
