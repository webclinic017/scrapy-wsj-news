    "body": "Sometimes politicians act in ways that reflect badly on their judgment and character and dishonor the cause they seek to advance.<br />Such was Robert Francis O’Rourke’s stunt on May 25, the day after 19 students and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas. About 15 minutes into a news conference by state and local officials to update the press on the investigation into the shooting, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate strode into the high-school auditorium, slipped into a seat near the front that had been held by a supporter, and waited for his close-up."
