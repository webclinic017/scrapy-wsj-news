    "body": "Online-only fashion retailers that boomed during the pandemic won’t be flattered by the latest inflation trend.<br />Shares in  Zalando  and ASOS, which sell clothing purely over the internet, are down 59% and 48% since the start of the year, respectively. Fashion stocks with a mix of online and store sales such as  Hennes & Mauritz  and Zara’s owner  Inditex  have fallen, too, but by around half as much. While the tech selloff has hurt growth-focused online operators, they also have bigger problems with transport costs."
