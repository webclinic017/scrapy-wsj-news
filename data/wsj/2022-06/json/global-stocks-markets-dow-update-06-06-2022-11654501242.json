    "body": "U.S. stock futures ticked higher, putting markets on track to recover from a muted trading week that ended in losses for major U.S. indexes.<br />Futures for the S&P 500 climbed 1% on Monday, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8%. Contracts for the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 were 1.3% higher. Major U.S. indexes fell Friday after data showed hiring growth slowed in May, though employers still added a strong 390,000 jobs."
