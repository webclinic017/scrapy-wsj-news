    "body": "Congress may be spending more money than ever, but the same can’t be said for the station that provides live coverage of it. C-Span expects its revenue to sink below $50 million this year for the first time since 2005. This bodes ill for an invaluable service to American democracy.<br />Created as a nonprofit in 1979 by a consortium of cable-TV operators, C-Span began by offering gavel-to-gavel coverage of the House. Seven years later it added Senate proceedings. Revenue came, as it does today, primarily from a share of monthly fees: roughly 6 cents from each connected home. In the mid-’90s, DirecTV and other satellite competitors started carrying the channels for the same per-customer fee."
