    "body": "As a golfer, I agree with Daniel Henninger (“LIV From the U.S. Open,” Wonder Land, June 16) about golf’s infuriating vicissitudes; variability in my tee shots is a 40-year mystery. I do not, however, understand the hand-wringing about golfers wanting a return on their countless hours of practice and hard work.<br />Competitive playing days are finite. Why not spend some on tours offering money for showing up to compete? Aren’t Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson and others merely repatriating dollars sent to Saudi Arabia for the fossil fuels we decline to pump out of the ground in the U.S.?"
