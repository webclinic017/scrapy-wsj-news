    "body": "There are many escalations that Vladimir Putin hasn’t committed, from the weapons he might use to the targets he might hit, because he wants to survive and see a path toward something that for domestic purposes helps cement his hold on power.<br />He wants to avoid war with NATO, conventional or otherwise. This is one consideration that would turn the possibility of victory into the certainty of defeat. He has sacrificed a large number of troops to NATO-supplied weapons without hitting back at NATO personnel or supply lines. As far as has been reported, there’s been no repeat of the covert attacks on Czech ammunition depots that followed his 2014 Ukraine aggression."
