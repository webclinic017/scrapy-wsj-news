    "body": "The economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic has been remarkable. April’s unemployment rates were at record lows in 17 states, and Friday’s labor report said the economy created 390,000 net new jobs in May. Yet America’s Medicaid program is suffering from long Covid.<br />In one of its 2020 aid bills, Congress temporarily boosted the federal government’s Medicaid contribution. As a condition to receive the extra money, states can’t disenroll Medicaid beneficiaries who become ineligible—only those who die, opt out or leave the state. This restriction lasts until the end of the official Public Health Emergency."
