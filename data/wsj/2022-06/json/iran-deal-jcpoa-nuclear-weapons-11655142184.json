    "body": "Your editorial “The Iranian Nuclear Dream Never Dies” (June 10) describes the 2015 deal as rewarding Iran with “billions of dollars for temporarily limiting nuclear activity.” That understates how bad a deal it was. Its dollar reward for Iran was not just billions, but hundreds of billions. President Obama said $150 billion. Michael Oren, once Israel’s ambassador to the U.S., estimated Iran’s gains at $700 billion.<br />The rewards weren’t necessarily “for temporarily limiting nuclear activity.” They were for unverifiable promises. Some of the rewards were front-loaded. The Journal reported, “The Obama administration secretly organized an airlift of $400 million worth of cash to Iran” in January 2016."
