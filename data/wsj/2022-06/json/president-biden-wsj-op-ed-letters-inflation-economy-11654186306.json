    "body": "Regarding President Biden’s “My Plan for Fighting Inflation” (op-ed, May 31): The first day Joe Biden took office, Vladimir Putin shut down the Keystone XL pipeline. Then, he forced the U.S. to allow the completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Mr. Putin then announced that no more oil-drilling leases would be allowed on U.S. public land or water.<br />Mr. Putin is now attempting to raise U.S. taxes and spend trillions of U.S. taxpayer dollars, further fueling runaway U.S. inflation, the likes of which Americans haven’t seen in decades."
