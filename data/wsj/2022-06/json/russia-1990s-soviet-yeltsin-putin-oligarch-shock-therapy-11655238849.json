    "body": "Robert D. Kaplan calls Russia’s first post-Soviet decade “near-anarchy” (“Communism Still Haunts Russia,” op-ed, June 9). This is better than the “cursed 1990s” of Kremlin propaganda, but misleading nevertheless.<br />In early 1992 the country was readying for a famine. The shelves of grocery stores were bare even in Moscow, and Muscovites stored sacks of potatoes on their balconies. The ruble was worthless and taxi drivers demanded packs of Marlboros for fare. By 1999, however, the tamed inflation, stable ruble, privatization and the elimination of price controls were filling the stores with plenty unimaginable by any living Russian. Once a backward autarky, Russia now had real banks and a stock exchange. The economy grew by almost 6%."
