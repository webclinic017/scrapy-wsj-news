    "body": "The image of law enforcement is suffering from a trifecta of diminished virtues of courage, leadership and, as Peggy Noonan notes in “The Uvalde Police Scandal” (Declarations, June 4), heroism. I cringe for my profession, having been a police officer for over 30 years in South Florida.<br />When you become a police officer, you know that you are duty-bound to service above self, including potentially giving up your life to protect others. Courage is not the absence of fear; it is doing what is necessary despite the fear."
