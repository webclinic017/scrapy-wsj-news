    "body": "Regarding your editorial “The Fed and Recession Fears” (June 15): What is so striking regarding the rise in inflation is what a slow yet inexorable process this has been, with the Federal Reserve and White House consistently behind the curve. The Fed’s heretofore easy-money stance and repeatedly false reassurances, despite months of unabated and ominous rising prices, combined with President Biden’s failure to formulate a more expeditious and thoughtful economic plan beyond that which he is currently proposing—a growth-slowing mix of more regulation and increased taxes—have exacerbated the present state of affairs. Thus far, Washington hasn’t met the moment.<br />Mark Godes"
