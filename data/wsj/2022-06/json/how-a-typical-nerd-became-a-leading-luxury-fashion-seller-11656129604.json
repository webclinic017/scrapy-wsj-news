    "body": "José Neves has spent the past 15 years building  Farfetch Ltd.  into a leading online marketplace for luxury products, but his career in luxury started almost by accident.<br />An avid coder since he was 8 years old, Mr. Neves said his sole ambition as a young man was to be Portugal’s answer to Bill Gates or Steve Jobs and run a software company. He founded his first tech business when he was 19, only to stumble into luxury when developing inventory software in the mid-1990s for Portuguese suppliers of such brands."
