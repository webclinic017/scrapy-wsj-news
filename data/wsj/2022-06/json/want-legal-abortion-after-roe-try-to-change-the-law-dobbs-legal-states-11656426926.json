    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Abortion Goes Back to the People” (June 25): Why do politicians refrain from proposing an amendment to the Constitution? The proper way to create an inalienable constitutional right is to amend the Constitution. Courts can then set limits, but they cannot overturn that right. Federal or state laws can alter it within limits, but they cannot abrogate it. The process of ratifying such an amendment also allows for open debate.<br />This could also apply to same-sex marriage, privacy or whatever else. Conversely, if the general public is fed up with gun violence, repealing the Second Amendment would also be the proper avenue to enable greater regulation of firearms."
