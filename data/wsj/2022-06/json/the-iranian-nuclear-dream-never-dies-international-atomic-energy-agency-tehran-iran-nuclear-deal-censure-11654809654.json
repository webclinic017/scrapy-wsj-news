    "body": "The Biden Administration finally got around this week to supporting an international censure of Iran for not cooperating with United Nations nuclear investigators. Yet the White House still wants to revive the 2015 nuclear deal, which is useless without a proper accounting for, and checks on, Iran’s nuclear malfeasance.<br />The International Atomic Energy Agency Board of Governors endorsed a resolution on Wednesday criticizing Iran for stonewalling a probe into undeclared nuclear activity and material. The rebuke passed 30-2, with three abstentions, though it used relatively mild language and didn’t set specific timelines for Iran to comply."
