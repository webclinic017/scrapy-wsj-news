    "body": "The leftist losing streak continues. First San Francisco voters of all people decide that they’ve had enough of so-called progressives laying waste to education and public safety. Then the Supreme Court signals that it’s done seizing political powers from the people and their elected representatives. And now even the commercial brand synonymous with counterculture capitalism is moving toward the sensible center.<br />Casual observers may think that the nasty wokesters who now dominate campus discourse spend all their time attacking American traditions like  limited constitutional governance and free speech. Recently we learned that even after leaving campus they also spend healthy portions of time attacking each other. But there are still plenty of hours left in the day for policy mischief directed at other countries, too."
