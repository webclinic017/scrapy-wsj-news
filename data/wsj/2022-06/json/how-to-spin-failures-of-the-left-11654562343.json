    "body": "This column can’t predict whether the people of San Francisco will finally vote for law and order on Tuesday by recalling District Attorney Chesa Boudin. What’s clear is that media leftists are concerned enough about the possibility that they are already working overtime to explain it away.<br />The City by the Bay is a place where offenses are now so unlikely to be met with strict punishment that last year one resident was comfortable participating in an on-camera interview in front of a local supermarket to explain how easily he had been able to shoplift inside. Not even close to amusing is the city’s surging murder rate."
