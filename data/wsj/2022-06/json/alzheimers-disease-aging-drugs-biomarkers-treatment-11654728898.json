    "body": "“Alzheimer’s Researchers Probe New Treatments” (U.S. News, May 23) demonstrates the need for more diverse approaches. Amyloid buildup is only one piece of the puzzle. Our success in fighting Alzheimer’s will come from the combination therapies that are standard of care for other major diseases of aging, such as heart disease, cancer and hypertension. Alzheimer’s is inextricably linked to the biology of aging, meaning there are many biological processes that go awry and contribute. This understanding is reflected by the many novel drug targets in today’s pipeline aimed at modifying the course of disease, slowing and perhaps halting its progression.<br />But drugs alone aren’t the answer. Researchers are making progress in identifying biomarkers that will accelerate early diagnosis and drug development. Today we have the first blood test for Alzheimer’s that reflects brain amyloid levels in plaques in early-stage patients. There will be blood tests soon that measure tau levels that reflect the brain tangles, and indicators of neuroinflammation, synaptic malfunction and metabolism. Other noninvasive tests, such as eye scans and digital markers, are in development."
