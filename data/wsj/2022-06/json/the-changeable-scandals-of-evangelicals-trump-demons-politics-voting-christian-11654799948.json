    "body": "What makes white evangelicals tick? The question has arisen repeatedly at least since Ronald Reagan’s election, when they became a central part of the Republican Party base. Especially since the election of Donald Trump, the study of white evangelicals has become less concerned with who they are than what’s “wrong” with them. To put the matter bluntly: “Evangelicals” have had a conversion and follow Jesus as he appears in the Bible. Those who are white tend to vote Republican. What’s their problem?<br />A recent piece in Vox, which reminds readers of the importance of prophecy to white evangelicals, is a typical example of the change. Frank Peretti’s bestselling novels, “This Present Darkness” (1986) and “Piercing the Darkness” (1989), appealed to born-again readers in part because the books treated news stories as part of a spiritual conflict between angels and demons. Mr. Peretti himself admitted that he wrote at a time when “Demons—and their doctrines—were gaining a weird, glassy-eyed respect from the popular culture.”"
