    "body": "TikTok’s eviction from India in 2020 left a gaping hole in the country’s fast-growing short-video market—one that Instagram and several homegrown rivals are fighting to fill. Many of these new Indian contenders are being cultivated by another American tech behemoth: Instagram-parent  Meta ’s  rival Google.<br />Last week, Google participated in a $255 million funding round that valued Mohalla Tech—parent of local language social-media platform ShareChat and short-video app Moj—at $5 billion. Moj is one of India’s largest short-video platforms. Mohalla also counts Temasek and Tiger Global as investors."
