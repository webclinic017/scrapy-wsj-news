    "body": "John Eastman takes issue with a line from Greg Jacob’s memo to Vice President Mike Pence suggesting that there was historical precedent for the vice president’s authority to reject electoral votes (“The Vice President’s Electoral Count Powers,” Letters, June 23). But Mr. Jacob’s testimony and legal analysis were perfectly consistent. John Adams and Thomas Jefferson declined to invalidate questionable electoral votes.<br />Law professors Bruce Ackerman and David Fontanawrote about this in the Atlantic in 2004. They explain that on Feb. 11, 1801, Jefferson opened and counted the electoral votes, including those from the state of Georgia, which were technically defective. Jefferson did not issue a ruling on the Georgia ballot, nor did he pause the count to refer the matter back to the state. He simply counted the votes. This happened to benefit Jefferson, but Messrs. Ackerman and Fontana argue that he also acted in accordance with his understanding of the limits of his authority. “Thanks to Jefferson’s statesmanship,” they conclude, “the Republic avoided a serious crisis in 1801.”"
