    "body": "I know four dedicated elementary-school teachers who have quit (“More Teachers Are Quitting,” Personal Journal, June 22). They received harsh feedback from parents and their school districts regarding their performance during the Covid-19 shutdowns. They despair that their school districts don’t allow staff to discipline disruptive students.<br />Too often parents are unwilling to set behavioral limits for their children and expect the schools to manage that task. Setting appropriate behavioral standards at home teaches children the skills they need to bring to the classroom."
