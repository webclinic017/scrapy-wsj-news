    "body": "When lawmakers and regulators move too fast, they break things. But then breakage seems to be the main point of a bipartisan group of Senators pushing legislation that would punish Big Tech companies. The bill has received little debate, yet Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wants to hold a vote pronto.<br />Giant businesses have always emerged during eras of technological upheaval.

Note that Big Tech stocks have plunged this year in part owing to slower growth and monetary tightening."
