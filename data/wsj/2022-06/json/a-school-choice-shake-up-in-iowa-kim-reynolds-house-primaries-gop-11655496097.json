    "body": "The school choice movement is gaining momentum, but one obstacle continues to be Republicans in the suburbs and some rural areas who are allied with the teachers unions. They mistakenly figure their schools are fine and they’ve already exercised choice by where they live. That’s why a reform rebellion this month in Iowa’s Republican primaries deserves broader attention.<br />Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds has made school choice a priority, and this spring the state Senate passed her bill to create up to 10,000 scholarships a year for education expenses, including private school tuition. Students with an individual program for special education needs or in families with incomes up to four times the federal poverty level could receive more than $5,000 a year."
