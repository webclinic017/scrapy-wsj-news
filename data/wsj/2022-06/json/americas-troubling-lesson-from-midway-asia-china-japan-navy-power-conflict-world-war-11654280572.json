    "body": "As the U.S. and China begin to face off in a rivalry for global leadership, the Pacific Ocean is again becoming a focus of global military power. Pacific countries like China, Japan and the U.S. aren’t the only ones filling these waters with well-armed ships: The U.K. sent its aircraft carrier, the HMS Queen Elizabeth, to the region for most of the past year, and even the relatively unmilitaristic Germans sent a frigate through the South China Sea in December.<br />While several recent conflicts have demonstrated the efficacy of various air- and land-power doctrines and technologies, there have been relatively few recent opportunities for naval forces to test their equipment and their mettle. Ukraine has managed to sink several Russian ships, but it isn’t clear if the experience of fighting in the relatively confined Black Sea will translate to the vast Pacific Ocean."
