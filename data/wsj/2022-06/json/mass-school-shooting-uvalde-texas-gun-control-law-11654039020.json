    "body": "I agree with your editorial “Young Men, Guns and Guardrails” (May 26) that there’s a “cultural erosion” that contributes to mass shootings. This may take years to repair. In the meantime, could something as simple as an alert system be put in place between gun sellers and the local police? It would signal when someone has purchased massive quantities of ammunition. Guns can’t kill without bullets.<br />Pamela Saba"
