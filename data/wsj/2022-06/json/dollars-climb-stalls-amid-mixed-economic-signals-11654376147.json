    "body": "A run of mixed economic data is dragging on the U.S. dollar, stalling a rally that has rippled through the economy and financial markets.<br />The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of 16 currencies, is around 2% off its May peak and fell 1.1% last month. That decline broke a steady march that brought the dollar to multidecade highs. The index rose 0.6% last week, breaking a two-week losing streak."
