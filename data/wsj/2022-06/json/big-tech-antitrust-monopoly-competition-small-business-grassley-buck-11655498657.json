    "body": "Your editorial “Breaking Big Tech Bad” (June 6) critiques our pending legislation, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, suggesting that we are “posing as defenders of small business.” If that’s how we look, it’s because that’s where we’re aiming. Our legislation restores competition to a broken market in which small- and medium-size businesses are at the mercy of Big Tech platforms to reach customers.<br />Ample evidence illustrates how Big Tech has engaged in anticompetitive behavior that has hurt businesses and consumers. If current law were enough to deal with the monopolistic behavior, there would have been straightforward judgments from the courts and penalties from regulators to curtail the behavior."
