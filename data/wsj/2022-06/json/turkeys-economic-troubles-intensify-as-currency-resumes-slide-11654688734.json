    "body": "ISTANBUL— Turkey has scrambled for months to shore up its economy by pumping billions of dollars into propping up its currency. Those measures are losing steam, tightening the economic squeeze on the country’s leader President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.<br />Russia’s invasion of nearby Ukraine, global inflationary pressures and a strengthening dollar have all added to Turkey’s troubles. The conditions have worsened a homegrown crisis that began last year after Mr. Erdogan pressured the central bank into cutting interest rates despite soaring inflation."
