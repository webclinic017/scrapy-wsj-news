    "body": "It’s been a busy week on the global summit circuit, with a Group of Seven confab in Germany and a conference in Madrid for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The two events are deeply entwined, but the leaders at the G-7 meeting didn’t much act like it.<br />Within the loose alliance of developed democracies, national militaries are the muscle, but the global market economy is the cardiovascular system. Military power is impossible to maintain, and security impossible to guarantee, without the efficient circulation of resources and the overall growth and flourishing afforded by the easy flow of economic lifeblood."
