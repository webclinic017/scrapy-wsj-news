    "body": "McKinsey & Co. has been a top government consultant since 2016 in Puerto Rico, helping the U.S. territory’s financial overseers manage its spending. In that time, corporate clients of the consulting firm have won tens of billions of dollars of government business, new disclosures show.<br />Since McKinsey began its work for Puerto Rico’s financial-oversight board, the firm has helped the board review and evaluate contracts with companies that are also McKinsey’s consulting clients, according to disclosures it filed in federal court last month and other public documents. McKinsey clients include some of the largest fuel suppliers to Puerto Rico, an infrastructure company with a major role in operating the territory’s electrical grid and contractors that support its public-health system."
