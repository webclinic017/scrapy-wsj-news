    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Breaking Big Tech Bad” (June 6): Success in areas such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing requires critical mass and substantial, sustained financial capital. In the U.S., the major advances in AI and QC are coming from Big Tech companies like Google,  Microsoft ,   Tesla  and  Amazon .  They have the scale and enormous infrastructure for computational hardware and software. As a result, they lead the world in these areas.<br />Americans should be concerned that antitrust activity may break up Google, Amazon or others. Although these companies need regulatory guidance, sacrificing scale in the name of domestic competition isn’t a wise strategy for the global marketplace."
