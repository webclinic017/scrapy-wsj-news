    "body": "One of the dark ironies of this election year is that while Democrats try to disqualify Donald Trump via the Jan. 6 hearings, they are helping to nominate his allies to run against in November. They had mixed success in Tuesday’s GOP primaries, but the tactic gives new meaning to cynical politics.<br />Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker has a record of failure that should make him vulnerable this fall. But lucky for him, he’ll face the Republican his money helped nominate. State Sen. Darren Bailey won the GOP primary with 58% of the vote Tuesday after Democrats spent more than $30 million on his behalf."
