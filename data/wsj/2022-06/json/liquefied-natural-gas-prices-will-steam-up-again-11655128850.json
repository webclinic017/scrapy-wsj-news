    "body": "An uneasy truce between Europe and Russia over the supply of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, has cooled the market. But it would be unwise to treat modestly lower prices as anything other than a temporary respite. LNG exporters like  Cheniere  and Tellurian will continue to benefit, while industrial and residential customers shouldn’t expect much relief.<br />An explosion at one of the largest U.S. LNG export terminals last week sent European gas prices soaring again—demonstrating the fragility of the market and the extent to which it remains exposed to any supply hiccup. Europe’s gas supplies have been under threat since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. While there still appears to be no immediate prospect of a complete halt to Russian supply, overall Russian flows to the region have fallen. In total, eight Gazprom contracts in seven European Union countries have been terminated, according to data from IHS Markit. Those terminations have vaporized 70 million cubic meters per day of gas supply."
