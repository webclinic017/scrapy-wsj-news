    "body": "About $2 trillion is being stashed in a Federal Reserve facility. Sooner or later, that could be a problem for banks.<br />The overnight reverse repurchase agreement, or reverse repo, facility has allowed the Fed to sop up excess liquidity from the economy by giving banks or big money managers a way to park cash and earn a return. Daily transactions in the facility hit $2 trillion last week and have remained around that level, up from around $1.5 trillion at the beginning of this year."
