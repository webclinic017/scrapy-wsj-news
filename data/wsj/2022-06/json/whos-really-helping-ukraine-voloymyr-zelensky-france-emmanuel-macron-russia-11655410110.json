    "body": "On Thursday four European leaders visited Kyiv, met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and hit the right notes in public remarks. Feel-good moments won’t reverse Russia’s recent battlefield gains, however, and Europe has fallen down on military assistance for Ukraine.<br />No one expected much to come from the visit, but at least it didn’t appear to be harmful, as some in Kyiv had feared. The leaders of Germany, Romania, France and Italy announced that they support granting Ukraine European Union candidate status. French President Emmanuel Macron also said Paris will send six more Caesar self-propelled howitzers to add to the 12 already in Ukraine. That’s welcome news but still an underwhelming contribution from the EU’s leading military power."
