    "body": "Credit Suisse  Group AG warned its capital position is eroding and that it expects another quarterly loss from weak market conditions and lower earnings in its investment bank.<br />The Swiss bank said investment banking has been hit by companies opting not to sell new stock or bonds in volatile conditions, wiping out a main source of revenue. It said the poor performance will push the division and the bank overall to a loss in the second quarter, for its third consecutive quarterly loss."
