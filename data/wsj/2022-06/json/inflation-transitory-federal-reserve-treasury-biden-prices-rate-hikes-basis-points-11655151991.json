    "body": "You would think by now that, informed by so many examples from history, we would be familiar with the stages of a policy disaster in the making. Calamitous wars and foreign-policy misadventures; economic, fiscal and regulatory blunders, costly social policy initiatives—almost all seem to follow the same pattern.<br />First denial, the refusal to accept the mounting evidence that we are on the wrong track. Next, complacency: Even when the inconvenient facts are reluctantly acknowledged, a misplaced confidence that a small adjustment is all that is needed to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. When that fails, the policy maker turns to wishful thinking, a doughty insistence on expecting the best in the face of the worst—everything will be all right; we have a plan premised on all the best possible assumptions. This is the terminal stage: At some point the full extent of the catastrophe is evident."
