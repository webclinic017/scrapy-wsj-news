    "body": "Pension plans and other institutional investors are embracing a federal proposal that would force hedge funds and private-equity funds to provide more disclosures to investors.<br />University endowments, insurance funds and retirement funds serving teachers and firefighters are urging the Securities and Exchange Commission to move forward with a proposed rule that would ensure private-fund investors receive annual audits and quarterly statements. The rule, which has been heavily criticized by the private funds and Republicans, would also prohibit fund managers from passing along certain legal costs and limit the fundsâ€™ ability to insulate themselves from lawsuits."
