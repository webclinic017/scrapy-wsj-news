    "body": "Welcome to the Journal’s pages, Mr. President. I trust your recent op-ed on your inflation plan is the first of many contributions to the paper. I admit to being envious: You were given 1,122 words to tell your story. We lesser lights get fewer than 820.<br />Let me begin with common ground. You started your piece by admitting that “Americans are anxious” about the economy. I agree. So does most everyone else. In May, the Gallup Economic Confidence Index hit its lowest mark since early 2009, near the Great Recession’s end."
