    "body": "Having practiced law for 45 years, and taught law for 25 of them, I can assure you that lawyers have to know how to think in a particular way that is unique to the profession. Law schools need an objective tool to measure whether an applicant has that capability. For decades, the LSAT has been such a tool (“Law Group Proposes LSATs Be Optional,” Page One, May 21). The recommendation of the ABA panel is an irresponsible and unrealistic example of virtue signaling. It’s nice to have a diverse population of lawyers. But it’s most important to have a diverse population of competent lawyers.<br />Robert E. Panoff"
