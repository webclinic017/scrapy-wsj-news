    "body": "Capt. Robert Scully longs for the military draft (Letters, June 10), whose end he calls a “cynical” move to keep voters out of military affairs. My father fought under Gen. Patton’s Third Army armored infantry and received a Silver Star and a Purple Heart. Yet having seen the horrors of war, he would have sent me to Canada rather than let me be conscripted.<br />At the convening of the President’s Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed Force, Gen. Westmoreland was proud of having conscripted 350,000 men three years prior, describing a volunteer army’s members as “mercenaries.” Milton Friedman asked him, “General, would you rather command an army of slaves?” Westmoreland replied, “I don’t like to hear our patriotic draftees referred to as slaves.” Friedman responded, “I don’t like to hear our patriotic volunteers referred to as mercenaries.”"
