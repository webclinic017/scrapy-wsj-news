    "body": "BOGOTA, Colombia—A panel investigating atrocities during Colombia’s epic civil war called for overhauling the country’s armed forces and critiqued the U.S.-backed war on drugs as part of its final report. The president-elect said he would consider the recommendations.<br />The report, made public Tuesday by a truth commission created as part of the government’s 2016 peace pact with Marxist rebels, offered the most comprehensive study yet of the half-century conflict that has cost some 260,000 Colombian lives and forced millions to flee the war-battered countryside."
