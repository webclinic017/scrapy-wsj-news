    "body": "When I was 3, I would occasionally walk beside my father while my mother was busy with my eight brothers and sisters. I was small and Daddy was tall and far too austere to take a toddler by the hand, much less carry me. Instead, he would hold out an elegant index finger. I would reach up, wrap my hand around it and off we’d go.<br />My father, who died in 2005 at 81, had nine children and 15 grandchildren. Today he would have 16 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. He and Mummy, now 93, married 72 years ago. The impressive tallies aside, Daddy was an understated, reserved paterfamilias who would be perplexed by parenting today."
