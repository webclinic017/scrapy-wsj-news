    "body": "The next front in the fight over the future of coal could be a portfolio of power plants up for sale in Southeast Asia.<br />South Korea’s majority-state-owned power company said in May that it would sell all its overseas coal assets, part of a sweeping cost-cutting plan. The proposal raises a recurring question: What should happen to coal plants that contribute to climate change but still have decades of operational life ahead of them? The dilemma is playing out in Australia, where a technology billionaire wants to shut down coal plants decades ahead of schedule, and in tensions over who should fund South Africa’s energy transition."
