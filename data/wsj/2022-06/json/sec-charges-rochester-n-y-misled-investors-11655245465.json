    "body": "The city of Rochester, N.Y., former city and school-finance officials and a municipal advisory firm misled investors about the school systemâ€™s distressed finances, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged Tuesday.<br />The agency alleges that Rochester in 2019 sold $119 million of municipal bonds on behalf of its school district without informing investors that the schools were in financial trouble because of overspending on teacher salaries. Former city finance director Rosiland Brooks-Harris, and former school finance chief Everton Sewell and city municipal adviser Richard Ganci of Capital Markets Advisors all knew about the trouble, the SEC said, but the bond offering documents included outdated financial statements."
