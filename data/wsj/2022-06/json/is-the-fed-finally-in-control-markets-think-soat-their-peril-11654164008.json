    "body": "Investors may be giving central banks too much credit—or blame—for whatever happens to inflation.<br />Stocks remain volatile even after late May’s relief rally, showing a tight inverse link with indicators of global financial conditions such as Treasury yields, corporate-debt spreads and demand for the U.S. dollar. Pessimists see a recession coming, as often happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, whereas optimists think the central bank can hit a sweet spot to balance inflation and economic growth."
