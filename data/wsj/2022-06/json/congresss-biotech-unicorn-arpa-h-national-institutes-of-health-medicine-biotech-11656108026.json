    "body": "It’s hard to recall a greater triumph of private innovation and failure of public health bureaucracies than the pandemic. So it’s bizarre, to say the least, that Members of Congress now want to launch a government healthcare startup to develop technologies that are supposedly too cutting-edge for private industry.<br />The House last week passed legislation by a 336-85 vote that would establish the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) within the Health and Human Services Department to invest in biomedical research. Isn’t that what Congress gave the National Institutes of Health $45 billion this year to do?"
