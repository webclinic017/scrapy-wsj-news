    "body": "I neither cried nor jumped for joy when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Abortion has never been among my top-priority issues when voting, and I don’t spend much time thinking about it. That may be hard to believe, but it’s true for a lot of people.<br />Now that the justices have said it isn’t their job but ours to decide how to regulate abortion, both pro-choice and pro-life activists are going to have to do better if they want the sympathy and votes of Americans like me. We can be persuaded with thoughtful, considered debate. We haven’t gotten much of it."
