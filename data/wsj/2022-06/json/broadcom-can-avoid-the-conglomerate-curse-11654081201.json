    "body": "Broadcom  will look like a very different company next year. The trick will be making sure the right things stay the same.<br />The $61 billion acquisition of  VMware  unveiled last week sets the chip maker on a path to becoming a new type of technology conglomerate. After the deal closes—currently expected sometime in Broadcom’s fiscal year ending in October 2023—about half the company’s total revenue will come from software. That mix could tilt even further if the current chip shortage ever eases and the semiconductor industry reverts back to its cyclical nature. Global chip sales have dropped in six of the past 20 years, according to data from the Semiconductor Industry Association."
