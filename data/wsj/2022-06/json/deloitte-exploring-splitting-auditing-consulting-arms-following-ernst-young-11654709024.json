    "body": "Deloitte is exploring a plan to split its global audit and consulting practices, following an effort by fellow Big Four accounting firm Ernst & Young to potentially spin off its consulting arm, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The moves would mark the biggest shake-up in the accounting industry in decades, handing windfalls to tens of thousands of the firmsâ€™ partners and creating two new consulting giants and two stripped-down auditing firms."
