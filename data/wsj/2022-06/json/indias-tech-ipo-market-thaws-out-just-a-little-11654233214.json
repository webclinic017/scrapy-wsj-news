    "body": "After a brutal beginning to 2022, India saw a surprisingly successful listing of a venture-backed startup on the public bourses last week. But investors shouldn’t expect healthy animal spirits roaming back into the Indian IPO market just yet.<br />Delhivery ,  which makes its living doing logistics for other e-commerce firms in India and counts  SoftBank ,  Tiger Global and  Carlyle  as investors, raised about $675 million. Shares, which made their debut at 487 Indian rupees each, closed Thursday at 570 rupees. A 17% jump might seem paltry by the standards of the go-go days of 2020 and 2021, but it looks like a success when markets world-wide remain turbulent with little visibility on when they will hit the bottom."
