    "body": "Another year, another Pennsylvania election that might come down to judges resolving a mail-vote snafu. This time it’s the Republican Senate race between Mehmet Oz and David McCormick. The hopeful news is a stay Tuesday by Justice Samuel Alito, which suggests the Supreme Court might finally tell the judiciary to stop rewriting election rules in the middle of the game.<br />The official tally says Mr. Oz leads by 955 ballots. Yet Mr. McCormick is winning roughly seven mail votes for each five for Mr. Oz. As usual, many mail ballots have been rejected for one reason or another. Allegheny County has more than 1,500 in the GOP and Democratic primaries. The legal war involves ballots on which the voter forgot to hand-write the date. Team McCormick thinks that includes roughly 900 Republicans statewide."
