    "body": "Vladimir Putin may have flubbed most of his war aims but he’s arguably achieving the most important, neutralizing Russia’s own urban, educated middle class, the real threat to his regime.<br />Whatever the merits of his complaints about NATO or Western hypocrisy, these are not sensible motives for the war he launched. Destroying the infrastructure and productivity of a territory you propose to annex, alienating its 44 million inhabitants, is not a useful goal except on the way to another goal."
