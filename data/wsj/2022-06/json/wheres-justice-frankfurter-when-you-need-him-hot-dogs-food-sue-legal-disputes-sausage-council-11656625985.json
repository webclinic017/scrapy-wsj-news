    "body": "Americans consume 20 billion hot dogs a year, according to the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council. On Independence Day alone, Americans will enjoy 150 million—enough to stretch from Los Angeles to the District of Columbia five times. With such a jaw-dropping number of wieners in circulation, it’s no wonder that they often play a role in legal disputes.<br />On July 4, 2010, a Dillard’s department store held a cookout for its employees. A manager instructed that the leftover hot dogs be frozen and saved for Labor Day. The following day, Nolan Koewler ate two of the earmarked hot dogs. The police were summoned, and to avoid arrest, Mr. Koewler admitted to the theft."
