    "body": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell discussed why the central bank increased interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point, its largest rate rise since 1994, during a press conference after the Fed’s monetary policy meeting Wednesday. With Fed officials concerned about inflation, now at a 40-year high, Mr. Powell said they expect more rate increases will be necessary, including, potentially, another 75-basis-point move at their next meeting as they seek to bring inflation down to the central bank’s 2% target.<br />JEROME H. POWELL: Good afternoon. I will begin with one overarching message."
