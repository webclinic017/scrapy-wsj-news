    "body": "Fame and acclaim in America these days are cheap commodities, accorded more for media appearances than achievement. We should spend more time noting the contributions of men like Dr. Douglas Canning, one of the world’s leading pediatric urologists, who died on May 30 in a bicycle accident at age 65.<br />Born in Connecticut, Canning received an Armed Forces Scholarship and trained in urology at the Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. He served in the Navy in San Diego before moving back east to join the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia."
