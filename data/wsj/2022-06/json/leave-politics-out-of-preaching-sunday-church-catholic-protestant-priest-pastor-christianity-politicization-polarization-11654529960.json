    "body": "As one who has also “preached nearly every Sunday of my adult life,” the reason for the absence of advocating one side of the aisle over the other from the pulpit has nothing to do with employment but rather with the purpose of worship (“Why Most Pastors Avoid Politics,” Review, May 28). These topics should be addressed in a forum where there can be discussion with opposing views and in-depth conversation rather than with a pastoral monologue with quips and sound bites, as if one speaks ex officio for God regarding politics.<br />From my Lutheran perspective, the purpose of worship is to preach the Gospel, praise God and administer the sacraments. It would be highly inappropriate and arrogant of me to use that sacred time to espouse my own political agenda. The people of God deserve more than that."
