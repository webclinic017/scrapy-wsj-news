    "body": "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin meets his counterparts in Brussels Wednesday to discuss what Ukraine needs in its war with Russia. Meanwhile, Russia’s grinding, annihilationist offensive in the Donbas is reportedly on the verge of seizing the two major cities not already under its control. The Western arms Ukraine urgently needs to counter the Russian offensive have been slow to arrive on the battlefield.<br />The situation suggests that the U.S. in Ukraine is falling into a persistent pattern: America gets involved in a conflict abroad, has some initial success, then falls short of achieving its objectives. Call it the Midway Measures Trap. On several occasions in the post-World War II world, the U.S. has found itself caught between two contradictory imperatives. One is to take steps, including military ones, to respond to aggression or some other threat. The other is to limit the response to contain the costs and the risks if those initial steps prove inadequate to the task—which they often do."
