    "body": "The leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion to a Politico reporter in May was a historic betrayal of the bench. Investigators reportedly are taking steps to obtain phone records and affidavits from the justices’ law clerks. If the leaker turns out to be a law clerk, he or she will be so ethically compromised that a career in the law will almost certainly be out of reach. Most commentators agree that federal law doesn’t criminalize such court leaks. We see things differently.<br />Working in the chambers of a federal judge—whether on the Supreme Court or elsewhere—is for good reason considered the best first job a law school graduate can land. Thousands of highly qualified law students typically apply for a single slot. The job affords entrance into an elite circle, and promises to open professional doors and provide credibility during the new attorney’s career. But this honor comes with the solemn institutional expectation that what happens in chambers stays in chambers. Justice Antonin Scalia had a reputation for not mincing words on the subject. He warned incoming classes of law clerks that he would do “everything in [his] power” to “ruin” the career of any law clerk who betrayed his confidences."
