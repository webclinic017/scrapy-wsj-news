    "body": "Last Saturday, a founder of a prominent Manhattan architecture firm, responsible for a recent historic renovation—let’s call him Alvin Muffley—alerted me via email that I am “among selfish and foolish boomers who have little regard for the futures of your kids and grandkids.” Apparently I “lack understanding of the real threat of climate change” and stand as an obstacle to changes that must “occur if future generations are to survive.”<br />This weirdly impertinent email came in response to a column guilty only of discussing why a carbon tax would be better than our current climate policies, and why such a tax seemed a heavy political lift only because of the abyss of rancorous tribalism into which the climate discussion has fallen."
