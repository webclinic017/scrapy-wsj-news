    "body": "Solar-power companies were already enjoying a rebound from a nasty selloff when they got a boost from the Biden administration, which said it wouldn’t impose new tariffs on solar imports. Investors in the industry have other things to worry about.<br />Shares of companies that install solar projects such as  Sunrun Inc.  and  Sunnova Energy International Inc.  have risen about 20% in the past month, paring some of this year’s declines. The latest gains, on Monday, were tied to the Biden administration’s statement that a U.S. government probe into whether Chinese solar producers are dodging tariffs by routing panels through Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia won’t result in additional levies."
