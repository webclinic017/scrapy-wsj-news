    "body": "Much of Latin America has been sliding to the authoritarian left in the last two decades, but Colombia has been an exception. That status faces a stern test on Sunday when Colombians go to the polls to elect a new President. The stakes are high for the U.S., too, given the risks that the country could become another Venezuela.<br />The choice in Colombia is between Gustavo Petro, an ideological ally, admirer and close friend of Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez, and Rodolfo Hernández, a businessman and former mayor who vows to defeat corruption. Both are antiestablishment populists, but only Mr. Petro went to the funeral of Chávez and declared the Venezuelan to have been “a great Latin American leader.” In 2003 Colombia’s Dinero magazine described him as “one of the closest advisers of Chávez in the new model being implemented in Venezuela.”"
