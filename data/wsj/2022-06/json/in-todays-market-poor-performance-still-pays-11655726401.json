    "body": "In a perfect world, public companies would compensate their executives commensurate with the creation of long-term shareholder value.<br />Last year, the median compensation for U.S. chief executives reached a record high for the sixth consecutive year, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month. While most pay packages are bolstered by restricted stock units that might never pay off, several handsomely paid executives last year helmed newly public companies that saw their stocks pop and quickly flop. A close examination of their incentives indicates that some packages proved far more shareholder-friendly than others."
