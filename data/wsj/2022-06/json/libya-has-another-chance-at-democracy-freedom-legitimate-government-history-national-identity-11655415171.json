    "body": "Libya was founded as a democracy. It is not too late to be a democracy again.<br />Eleven years ago, Libyans tried to reclaim their freedoms from an autocratic regime and acquire the protections of democratic government. But since then, all efforts to provide Libyans with those freedoms have failed. At best, they fizzled out; at worst, they have ended in terror and war. On June 22, the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum’s road map—the United Nations’ latest attempt to build Libyan democracy—expires. Libyans are now holding their breath for what the next failure will bring."
