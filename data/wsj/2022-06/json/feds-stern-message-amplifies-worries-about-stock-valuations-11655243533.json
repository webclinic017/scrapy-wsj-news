    "body": "The prospect of faster-than-expected monetary tightening has rattled Wall Street, dragging the S&P 500 deeper into bear territory Tuesday and forcing investors to reassess a stock market that doesn’t look cheap even after its dramatic selloff.<br />It has been an ugly spell in markets, reflecting concerns about how the economy will hold up as the Federal Reserve embarks on its sharpest campaign of interest-rate increases in decades.
