    "body": "For a while this column has been urging President Joe Biden to avoid public speaking, at least when the topic is important. Perhaps the president deserves some credit for often following this approach. But it also has to be acknowledged that, risky as it may be, Mr. Biden now has a major media opportunity that could help him serve the country and help himself politically.<br />As for recent Biden habits, it seems the president has been avoiding many interview requests that would typically be accepted by his predecessors."
