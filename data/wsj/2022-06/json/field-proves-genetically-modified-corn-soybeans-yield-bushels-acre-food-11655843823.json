    "body": "Regarding Terry Wanzek’s “A Solution to the Wheat Shortage: Genetically Modified Crops” (Cross Country, June 11).<br />My grandfather was crushed to death in a farm accident in Minnesota during harvest on Oct. 12, 1956, his 64th birthday. A few days later some 25 neighbors arrived to pick the corn. The local paper covered the event and reported a “remarkable” yield of 60 bushels an acre. Last fall his grandson, who now owns the farm, harvested 270 bushels an acre on the same field where the accident occurred. The enormous yield was due to a number of factors, including the use of genetically modified seed."
