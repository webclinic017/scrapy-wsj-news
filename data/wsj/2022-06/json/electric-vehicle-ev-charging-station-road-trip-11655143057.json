    "body": "Rachel Wolfe’s saga of her electric-vehicle road trip is revealing of the missteps of EV infrastructure development (“2,013 Miles. No Gas. Many Hassles,” Exchange, June 4). Many utilities have pushed for ratepayer-funded chargers with a mind to get some out there fast. This artificially hides the costs of charging and stunts the development of a competitive private market. It also has meant the installation of slower chargers with less incentive to maintain and upgrade them.<br />When private-sector companies install chargers with a chance to make money on selling electricity, they are incentivized to keep those chargers working—and to make them as fast as possible so that they can serve more customers. But we have fewer of those private-sector chargers because of the utility installations that undercut the nascent market."
