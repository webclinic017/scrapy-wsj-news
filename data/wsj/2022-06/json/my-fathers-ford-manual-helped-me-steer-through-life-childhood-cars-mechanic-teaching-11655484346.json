    "body": "During my childhood in the 1970s, another time when inflation plagued household budgets, my father pinched pennies by doing his own car repairs—even the hard stuff that usually sent other dads to the local mechanic.<br />There were, alas, no YouTube videos back then to help my dad master the maintenance of our family sedan, always a secondhand model. Another strict rule of domestic economy at our house was that we never bought new cars."
