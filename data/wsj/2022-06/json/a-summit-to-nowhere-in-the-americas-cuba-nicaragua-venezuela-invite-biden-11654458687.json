    "body": "The ninth Summit of the Americas kicks off in Los Angeles on Monday, but as of Sunday the Biden administration couldn’t confirm the heads of state who will attend. The disarray is a metaphor for Biden foreign policy in the region.<br />There hasn’t been an Americas summit on U.S. soil since the original was held in Miami in 1994. The administration seems to have reckoned that a gathering in Southern California after 28 years would be an inevitable success. That was its first summit mistake—but not its last."
