    "body": "There were few U.S. cities in 2020 where activists and politicians embraced lawlessness and condemned police as aggressively as in Seattle. The legacy of that period—including a spike in crime and a wave of officers leaving the force—is still haunting the community and many of its most brutalized victims.<br />In Seattle and elsewhere, thank goodness the political pendulum has swung back a bit toward public safety, but it’s a long hard road to peaceful streets."
