    "body": "The pandemic isn’t solely to blame for the broken supply chain. For America’s refrigeration and air-conditioning businesses, the main culprit is the Environmental Protection Agency.<br />Worthington Industries  is the only U.S. maker of lightweight recyclable cylinders for transporting refrigerants. Chinese manufacturers are our main competitors. In April 2021 the Commerce Department found that China acted illegally in subsidizing this market by selling at less than fair market value. Two weeks later the EPA made a surprise announcement that it would ban making nonrefillable cylinders in the U.S. starting July 1, 2025. This will result in shortages and higher prices."
