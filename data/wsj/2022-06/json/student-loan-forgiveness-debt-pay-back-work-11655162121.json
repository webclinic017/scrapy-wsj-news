    "body": "Regarding Blake Hurst’s op-ed “Student Debt Forgiveness Makes My Grandson a Chump” (June 9): He has company. I, too, am a chump. I didn’t wish for my three children to graduate college burdened with debt. Consequently, for six years I worked two jobs and took all the overtime I could, as did my spouse.<br />No fancy vacations, no high-end restaurants, much less a new car to replace our clunker. We also dug deeply into our retirement savings. My question to Sen. Elizabeth Warren and President Biden is: How will I be made whole? Or am I just another chump? Now my tax dollars will be used to pay down the debt that others have incurred."
