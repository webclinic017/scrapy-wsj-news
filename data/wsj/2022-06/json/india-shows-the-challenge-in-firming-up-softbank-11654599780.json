    "body": "Amid a technology bear market, the industry is racing to position itself as having somehow reformed—what venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital last month dubbed a “crucible moment.” But for  SoftBank ,  there may be little defense.<br />SoftBank’s Vision Funds lost about $27 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31. The investment firm blamed much of those losses on poor performance of its public companies beholden to regulatory developments in the U.S. and China. Chief Executive Masayoshi Son has been clear that he expects the current market uncertainty to stay for the foreseeable future, with geopolitical risks a key compounding factor."
