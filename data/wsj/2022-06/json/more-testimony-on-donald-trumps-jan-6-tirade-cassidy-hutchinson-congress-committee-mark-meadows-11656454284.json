    "body": "Just when it seems as if Donald Trump’s behavior after his 2020 loss couldn’t possibly look worse, a new piece of wild testimony arrives. The House Jan. 6 inquiry on Tuesday called Cassidy Hutchinson, described as the principal aide to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows.<br />The biggest news is that Mr. Trump was advised, according to Ms. Hutchinson, that some of the people who were awaiting his Jan. 6, 2021, speech had come armed. He was angry that the crowd wasn’t filling up the ellipse, apparently because some onlookers preferred not to go through the official security check, which included magnetometers, or “mags” for short."
