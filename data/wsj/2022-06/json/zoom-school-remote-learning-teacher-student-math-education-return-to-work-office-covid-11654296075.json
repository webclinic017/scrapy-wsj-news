    "body": "In “The Weekend Interview With Edward Glaeser” (May 28), Tunku Varadarajan touches on a subject close to my professional domain: “the unmitigated disaster that remote learning has been for American children.” As a math teacher with 28 years in the trenches, I witnessed that unmitigated disaster.<br />It is obvious that all math courses have a prequel and a sequel. Academic year 2020-21 placed nearly all students in a remote-learning setting. That year, I taught—and I use the term loosely—algebra-I, the prerequisite for geometry and algebra-II. Each day I kept track of the number of students who were actively engaged. All students had the option of clicking on the appropriate Zoom link, then tuning in or tuning out."
