    "body": "U.S. natural-gas prices plummeted after an LNG shipping facility in Texas said a fire last week would knock out the facility until late this year, greatly reducing export capacity.<br />Natural-gas futures for July delivery fell more than 16% to end Tuesday at $7.189 per million British thermal units, the latest whipsaw move in the market for the power-generation and heating fuel. Futures prices for deliveries through February shed at least 10% on the day, suggesting greatly diminished fears about shortages this coming winter."
