    "body": "Fashion student Ava Grand started buying extremely cheap fast-fashion pieces from Chinese e-commerce giant Shein during the pandemic. When the clothing arrived from China in individually wrapped plastic packages, she felt guilty about the waste. So she used some of her leftover packaging to stitch a tote bag that she then posted to TikTok. It soon had millions of views and positive comments. Ms. Grand, who recently graduated from Marist College in New York and moved to Los Angeles, ended up making an entire runway collection out of more Shein plastic bags crowdsourced from strangers.<br />Ms. Grand is just one of the young people making statements about the environmental impact of Shein, which was recently valued at $100 billion—more than fellow fast-fashion companies  H&M  and Zara combined. Launched in 2008, Shein has become a favorite of Gen Z in recent years for its responsiveness to the ever-churning trend cycle and shockingly low prices. Thousands of new items are uploaded every day, such as a lime-green stretchy crop-top-and-miniskirt set for $2.90, that will give you the air of Kim Kardashian for less than the price of a gallon of milk. Shein has taken Zara’s model of quickly producing more items that people search for and buy and turbocharged it. There are over a thousand other green crop-top-and-skirt sets currently available."
