    "body": "Walmart  is betting big on Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart’s expansion ahead of a possible U.S. public listing next year. Success would give the U.S. retailer’s global footprint—and e-commerce chops—a big shot in the arm. Failure could see it fall further behind  Amazon .<br />Last week, Walmart International Chief Executive Judith McKenna said Flipkart has lived up to expectations since Walmart invested $16 billion four years ago, and the company remains supportive of its IPO plans. Walmart owns three-quarters of Flipkart, which was valued $37.6 billion after its fundraising round last July. Flipkart, which also counts Tiger Global and SoftBank as investors, is Walmart’s most promising bet against Amazon—in one of the most intensely competitive and largest online markets in the world."
