    "body": "I agree with many points you raise in “The Evidence of the Jan. 6 Committee” (Review & Outlook, June 11). I disagree, however, with the way you start, emphasizing that Democrats want to “besmirch” the GOP.<br />No doubt the Democratic Party leadership wants to take advantage of this moment. But the GOP leadership let it happen by not responding appropriately and by demeaning the few who have done so, such as Rep. Liz Cheney."
