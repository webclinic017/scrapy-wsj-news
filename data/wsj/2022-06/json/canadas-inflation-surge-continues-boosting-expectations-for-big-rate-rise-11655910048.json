    "body": "OTTAWA—Annual inflation in Canada accelerated in May toward 8%, reaching a nearly four-decade high and all but locking in market expectations that the country’s central bank will raise its policy interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point in July.<br />Economists expect inflation in Canada to surpass 8% when June data are released, and possibly stay above 7% for the bulk of 2022. The need for aggressive Bank of Canada rate increases to tame inflation has prompted analysts to predict a sharp slowdown in economic growth starting in the second half of this year, and to warn of heightened risks of a recession."
