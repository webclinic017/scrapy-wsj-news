    "body": "Regarding Allysia Finley’s “Cannabis and the Violent Crime Surge” (op-ed, June 7): Focusing on the inappropriate and medically dangerous underage use of cannabis throws the baby out with the bath water. I constantly see the benefits of cannabis among cancer patients.<br />The solution, as with alcohol, tobacco and narcotics, is education and regulation. But with cannabis, users essentially eliminate risk of death by liver cirrhosis, delirium tremens, lung cancer and respiratory depression. I favor an immediate removal of cannabis’ Schedule 1 status and the establishment of 24 as the legal age for all forms of cannabis use."
