    "body": "Policies that originate in California have a habit of spreading where Democrats also hold power, so it’s worth paying attention to a union-backed bill in Sacramento that would create a new government council to micromanage the fast-food industry. The goal is to kill fast-food franchises while avoiding political accountability for their destruction.<br />Unions have long groused that corporations use the franchise business model to avoid legal liability and collective bargaining. Their real beef is that franchising makes it harder to organize workers and shake down deep-pocketed corporations. But franchising makes it easier for entrepreneurs, including many minorities, to start their own business."
