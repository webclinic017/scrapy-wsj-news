    "body": "Russian soldiers withdrew Thursday from Snake Island, a small but significant outpost in the Black Sea. The Ukrainian victory doesn’t signal a major change in the course of the war, but it does weaken the Kremlin’s Black Sea blockade.<br />Snake Island is located just off the coast near Ukraine’s border with Romania and close to the mouth of the Danube River. Seizing it was a top priority when Russia launched its invasion. It succeeded—but only after the soldiers defending it famously told the Russian warship to you-know-what."
