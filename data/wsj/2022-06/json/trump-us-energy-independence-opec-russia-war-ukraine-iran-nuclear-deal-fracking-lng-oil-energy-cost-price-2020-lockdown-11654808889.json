    "body": "Global oil markets were experiencing unprecedented volatility in March and April 2020, with spot U.S. crude oil trading between $47 and negative $37 a barrel. By May the world was beginning to absorb the economic shutdown. It became clear that the drop in oil demand would endure for more than a few weeks.<br />That month several energy ministers approached Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette with a stunning offer: They wanted the U.S. to start regularly coordinating energy supply with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. It was an offer to join in the Declaration of Cooperationâ€”the pact that created OPEC+, a powerful cartel that includes the original OPEC member countries and 10 other states."
