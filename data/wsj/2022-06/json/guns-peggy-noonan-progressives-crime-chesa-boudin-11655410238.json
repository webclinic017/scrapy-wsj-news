    "body": "In “The Boiling Over of America” (Declarations, June 11), Peggy Noonan calls for a strange solution to the mass shootings in America: a ban on weapons for 18-year-olds. Unlike drinking or smoking, the right to keep and bear arms is protected by the Constitution. It is not a privilege granted by government, but an inalienable right that all adult citizens should be allowed to enjoy. If a person is old enough to die for his country and its Constitution, he should be old enough to enjoy all of the rights.<br />Sean Harrison"
