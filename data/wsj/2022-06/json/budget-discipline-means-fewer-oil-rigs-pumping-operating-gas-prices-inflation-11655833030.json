    "body": "In “How the U.S. Turned the Tables on OPEC” (op-ed, June 10), Paul Dabbar credits the petroleum industry’s innovation, Washington’s pro-supply policies and increased investment for the oil and gas supply boom during the past two decades. But he makes no mention of Wall Street’s turn away from oil and gas investment, which started in 2019.<br />Faced with high expenses and low returns during the shale boom, investors began to insist on budgetary discipline. Petroleum companies eventually complied. The number of rigs drilling for oil and gas peaked in November 2018 at 1,077, slowly fell to 771 in March 2020 and crashed to a low of 250 in August. There were 740 rigs operating on June 17—still below the prepandemic level."
