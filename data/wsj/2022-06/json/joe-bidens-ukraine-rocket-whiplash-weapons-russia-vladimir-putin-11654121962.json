    "body": "The White House on Wednesday announced $700 million more in weapons for Ukraine, and the good news is the U.S. will send some sophisticated firepower to help beat back the Russians in the country’s east.<br />Russia is gaining ground in Ukraine as the war has become a brutal artillery fight. The Russian advance is slow and costly, including “devastating losses amongst mid and junior ranking officers,” the Institute for the Study of War noted this week. But the Russian military has an artillery advantage in range and firepower."
