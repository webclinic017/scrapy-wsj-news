    "body": "After winning Tuesday’s special election in Texas, Mayra Flores will soon become America’s first Mexican-born Congresswoman—and by the way, she’s a Republican who’s married to a Border Patrol agent. What a great American story, plus another piece of evidence that Democrats won’t win the future on demographics alone.<br />The 34th district is in South Texas, the Rio Grande Valley, where the GOP has made many inroads. Some news reports say this swath of the Lone Star State hasn’t been represented in the House by a Republican since 1870. Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela held the seat for years, winning in 2020 by 14 points, before resigning to join a lobbying firm."
