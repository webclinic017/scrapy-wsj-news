    "body": "Peggy Noonan asks some pertinent questions in “Let Not Our Hearts Grow Numb” (Declarations, May 28), but guns are not the problem. Firearms have been widely available for a long time, but the mass-shootings problem is new. The truth is that over the past 50 years we have built a society, brick by brick, that doesn’t work very well, and we are now facing the unintended consequences. Consider the dismantlement of the mental-health system in the 70s, the cult of narcissism and the retreat of religious values.<br />“Get rid of all the guns” is an easy nostrum because it will never happen. Fixing our broken society is so much harder, because it would force us to rethink all the measures we have implemented that just don’t work."
