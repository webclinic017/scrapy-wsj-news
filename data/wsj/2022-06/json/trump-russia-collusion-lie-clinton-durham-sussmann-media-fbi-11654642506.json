    "body": "Kimberley Strassel exposes, with great élan, the cynical insider machinations that let the FBI perpetuate the Russiagate hoax (“Durham vs. the Beltway Swamp,” Potomac Watch, June 3). This even extended into the courtroom, as she writes. The judge in the trial of Michael Sussmann worked with him at the Clinton Justice Department. The U.S. attorney general officiated at the judge’s wedding to a former Obama lawyer—who now defends Russiagate-FBI figure Lisa Page. A juror has a daughter on the same rowing team as the defendant’s kid. This is blind justice?<br />Mercifully, criticism of the Beltway media is confined to less than one paragraph.  The New York Times  and Washington Post won Pulitzer Prizes for their intrepid reporting of the Russiagate allegations—without ever uncovering the deplorable misdeeds and lies therein."
