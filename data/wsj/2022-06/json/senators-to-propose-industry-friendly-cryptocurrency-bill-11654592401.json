Cynthia Lummis (R., Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.) were set to introduce a bill Tuesday dubbed the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, which aims to create a “complete regulatory framework for digital assets.” In a joint press release, they said it would balance the crypto market’s need for guardrails and consumer protections with a desire to promote financial innovation."
