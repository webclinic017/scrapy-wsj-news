    "body": "The prosecution of political opponents is a feature of banana republics that increasingly infects the U.S. A case in point is the prosecution of former GOP Gov. Rick Snyder in the Flint water case, which a unanimous state Supreme Court declared invalid this week.<br />Democrats claimed the former Governor and his staff ignored Flint’s problem with lead-tainted water, never mind that the Obama Environmental Protection Agency knew about it and did nothing. Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel ordered Solicitor General Fadwa Hammoud and Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy to investigate the Flint fiasco."
