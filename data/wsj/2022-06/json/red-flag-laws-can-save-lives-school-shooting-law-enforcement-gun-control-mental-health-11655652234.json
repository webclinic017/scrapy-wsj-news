    "body": "Senate legislation on gun violence is likely to include “support for crisis intervention,” which will mean funding and incentives for states to implement extreme risk protection orders, also known as ERPOs or “red flag” orders. This policy compromise could save lives.<br />We are part of a team from eight universities, funded by the National Collaborative on Gun Violence Research, that is analyzing ERPO petitions across six states. Our preliminary findings show the scale of mass-shooting threats is larger than we could have imagined. We found that 9.5% of orders are for mass-shooting threats—that’s 626 cases from 2013-20 in which there’s a credible threat presented to a judge."
