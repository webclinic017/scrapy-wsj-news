    "body": "It isn’t everywhere that the potential ousting of a head of government is celebrated by investors as a step toward political stability. In the case of Britain, they might have a point.<br />The pound was the best-performing major currency Monday after news broke that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson would that evening face a no-confidence vote by lawmakers of his own ruling Conservative Party. The challenge to his leadership follows widespread anger about parties held at Downing Street during the Covid-19 lockdowns. Mr. Johnson ended up hanging on to his job by 211 votes against 148, which may help explain part of sterling’s overnight dip. It regained some ground later on Tuesday."
