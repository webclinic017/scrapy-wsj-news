    "body": "It’s sensible for Americans to maintain low expectations for presidential leadership given that Joe Biden served as a senator during the Carter and Reagan administrations and then somehow concluded that the better economic policies were Jimmy Carter’s.<br />Americans were so emphatic in reaching the opposite conclusion that they made Ronald Reagan the winner in 44 states when he defeated Mr. Carter in 1980 and in 49 states when he defeated Mr. Carter’s former Vice President Walter Mondale in 1984. As the sting of those defeats has lessened with time, Mr. Carter must now be proud to see Mr. Biden pursuing one of the signature policies of the Carter era: responding to meager supplies of gasoline by launching political attacks on energy companies. Let’s hope that Mr. Biden doesn’t do anything as foolish as the so-called “windfall profits” tax Mr. Carter signed into law in 1980  to try to plunder oil revenues."
