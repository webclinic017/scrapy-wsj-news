    "body": "Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Rep. Jim Jordan justify their refusal to cooperate with the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by asserting that “The Jan. 6 Committee Is Weaponizing Majority Rule” (op-ed, May 27). They claim that the committee is illegitimate and that its subpoenas lack a valid legislative purpose, but they decline to note that federal district and appellate courts have considered and flatly rejected these arguments.<br />On Jan. 6, a mob launched a violent effort to prevent the certification of the 2020 presidential election results, rupturing our nation’s tradition of peacefully transferring power. Extensive reporting has made clear that these lawmakers have relevant information about the attack, as well as the monthslong campaign to overturn the election that preceded it. Investigators have sought their voluntary testimony, which these lawmakers rebuffed."
