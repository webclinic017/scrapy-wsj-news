    "body": "In “The White House Keeps Stoking Covid Fears” (op-ed, June 6), Jay Bhattacharya misconstrues Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data and disease-burden estimates regarding Covid-19 and influenza. This inappropriately plays down the risks that Covid-19 and seasonal influenza pose to children, at the population level. Correctly read, CDC surveillance indicates that Covid-19 has caused substantially higher hospitalizations and deaths in children than seasonal influenza usually does, as the CDC itself has recently said publicly.<br />Both Covid-19 and influenza are vaccine-preventable illnesses that warrant concern and mitigation. Alerting the public that Covid-19, like influenza, is a population-level public-health risk to children is not “scaremongering.” Comparing such diseases to external causes of death—like drug- and alcohol-related deaths, as Dr. Bhattacharya does—is, however, an epidemiologically inappropriate tactic."
