    "body": "The House on Tuesday finally passed a bipartisan bill to step up security for Supreme Court Justices and their families, and the embarrassment is that Speaker Nancy Pelosi sat on the measure for weeks, even after a man with a gun showed up at Brett Kavanaugh’s house in the middle of the night. More than two dozen Democrats apparently don’t think the Justices deserve additional protection.<br />The Supreme Court Police Parity Act passed the Senate unanimously in May. The purpose of the bill is to extend extra security to the families of Justices, consistent with protections offered for senior Members of Congress or executive appointees."
