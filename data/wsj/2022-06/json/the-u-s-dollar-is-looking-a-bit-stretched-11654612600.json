    "body": "The U.S. dollar’s rally has paused. Investors shouldn’t necessarily assume it will resume.<br />The greenback has been an unsurprising beneficiary of the Federal Reserve’s tightening campaign: Higher interest rates drive flows into U.S. bonds and other dollar assets and out of other currencies.
