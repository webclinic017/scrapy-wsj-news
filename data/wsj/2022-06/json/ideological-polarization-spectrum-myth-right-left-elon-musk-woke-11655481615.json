    "body": "A tweet by Elon Musk recently went viral among one of the least viral groups in society: political scientists. In an effort to explain why he no longer identifies as a liberal, Mr. Musk shared a cartoon (created by Colin Wright) that relies on the familiar “left-right” political spectrum. In this image, the centrist protagonist and conservatives remain stationary while liberals sprint to the “woke progressive” left. As a result of what the cartoon called “fellow liberals” stretching the political spectrum leftward, Mr. Musk indicated, he had gone from being center-left in 2008 to center-right in 2021—even though his political beliefs hadn’t changed.<br />Our fellow political scientists, most of whom identify as “liberal” or “progressive,” were incensed at the suggestion that their side had become extreme. They cited a vast academic literature, much of which relies on a statistical application called “DW-NOMINATE,” arguing that the Republican Party has moved to the “extreme right” in recent decades while their own Democratic Party has remained relatively moderate and sensible."
