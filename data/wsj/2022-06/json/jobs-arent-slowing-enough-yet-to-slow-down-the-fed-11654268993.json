    "body": "America’s job market really does look like it is slowing down. It remains way over the Federal Reserve’s speed limit, though.<br />The Labor Department on Friday said that the economy added 390,000 jobs last month, down from April’s 436,000 and the slimmest gain in over a year. Over the past three months there have been 1.2 million jobs added—a marked step down from December when the rolling three-month gain came to 1.9 million."
