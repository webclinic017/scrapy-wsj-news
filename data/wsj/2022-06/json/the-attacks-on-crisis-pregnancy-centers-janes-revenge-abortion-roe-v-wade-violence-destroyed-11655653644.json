    "body": "Luke Cirillo got a call from police in the wee hours of June 10. Someone “threw an incendiary through one of the windows, which lit a significant fire in the back room,” says the CEO of First Image, which runs three crisis-pregnancy centers in the Portland, Ore., area. The room was destroyed, and the center, in Gresham, is temporarily closed.<br />It was the second attack at a First Image facility in as many months. On May 5, vandals shattered windows and spray-painted “F— CPCs”—crisis-pregnancy centers—on the wall in Southeast Portland."
