    "body": "Years of unbridled growth that reaped little profit for Southeast Asia’s Internet champions—and dragged stock prices down—may finally be about to pay dividends. That’s true even amidst a brutal sell-off in tech shares globally.<br />The key reason: local market consolidation and stronger bargaining power with merchants and customers. Shares of Southeast Asian tech companies such as  Sea Ltd. ,  Grab Holdings  and GoTo Group—which have largely been off most Western investors’ radar—were punished earlier this year. But they might bounce back more quickly than better-known names such as Netflix or  Amazon ,  given that the fundamentals of their businesses appear to be improving."
