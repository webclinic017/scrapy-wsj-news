    "body": "Between rising interest rates and input costs, green-minded investors have a lot to worry about these days. Their biggest concern could end up being boring old red tape.<br />Wind and solar, which require heavy upfront investment, grew rapidly over the past decade in the U.S. while certain conditions were just right. Interest rates were closer to zero for nine out of the last 13 years, during which time wind and solar generation increased more than sixfold. Over that same period, the cost of installing solar has declined almost 90%, while for wind it has fallen 72%, according to Lazard. Tax credits helped bring costs down, too."
