The hashtag “Shanghai is back” is lighting up Weibo, China’s  Twitter -like microblogging service.<br />But the scenes of jubilation from Shanghai, and modestly better economic news—factory purchasing managers index readings for May have ticked up—belie a deeply troubled labor market. Unemployment for the 16-to-24-year-old cohort was 18.2% in April according to China’s statistics bureau, well above the previous recorded high of 16.8% in July and August of 2020. Given that youth unemployment typically peaks in the several months after graduation, that number will probably head even higher this summer. Less than half of new college graduates had an offer in hand as of last month according to a survey from online recruitment website Zhaopin, compared with 63% in the spring of 2021, and about 75% in 2018."
