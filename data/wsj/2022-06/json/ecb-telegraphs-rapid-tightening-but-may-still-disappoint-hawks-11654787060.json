    "body": "The sight of the European Central Bank committing itself to raising interest rates twice in the next three months is a rare one. Even after scoring a first victory, though, hawks shouldn’t get too ahead of themselves.<br />The eurozone’s central bank said Thursday it intends to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage point in July and again in September—whether by another 0.25 percentage point or a larger amount will depend on whether inflation shows signs of abating. It is as fast as the ECB was ever likely to act, given its promise not to lift rates before ending its bond-buying programs, which will now happen next month. Delivering a supersize increase in July was ruled out for this reason, ECB President Christine Lagarde said."
