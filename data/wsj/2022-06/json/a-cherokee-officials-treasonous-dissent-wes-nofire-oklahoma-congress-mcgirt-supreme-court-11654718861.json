    "body": "Wes Nofire is a former professionally ranked heavyweight boxer running for Congress in eastern Oklahoma. The June 28 GOP primary for the 2nd district features more than a dozen contenders, including a state Senator and a police chief, but Mr. Nofire has a unique selling point.<br />He’s a sitting lawmaker on the Cherokee Nation’s 17-person Tribal Council. And he thinks the Supreme Court’s McGirt ruling has been disastrous for everyone. “Right now, it’s dangerous to every Oklahoman,” he says, “whether you’re an Indian or you’re non-Indian.”"
