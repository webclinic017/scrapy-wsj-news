    "body": "Greed, dishonor, scandal and murder aren’t normally associated with the sport of golf. But golf, invented 500 years ago in Scotland, finds itself this week engulfed in a battle between its reputation for scandal-free fair play and Saudi Arabia’s oil money. The controversy is a parable for our tense, troubled times.<br />As part of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plan to modernize the oil kingdom, the Saudi Arabia Investment Fund, valued at some $600 billion, has underwritten the new LIV Golf Invitational Series. Golf, a lucrative sport for nearly all players who make the PGA Tour—which was formed by the pro players themselves in the late 1960s—has never seen anything like the Saudis’ money. In fact, money is the only point."
