    "body": "Human smuggling is an ugly business, and sometimes a murderous one. The death of at least 50 migrants trapped in a truck in broiling heat on Monday is a crime, but it’s also another sign that America lacks a humane, sensible immigration policy.<br />Temperatures in San Antonio rose to 103 degrees Monday, when a passerby heard a weak cry for help coming from migrants trapped inside a tractor-trailer and called 911. First responders found “stacks of bodies” and no signs of water inside the trailer, said San Antonio Fire Chief Charles Hood."
