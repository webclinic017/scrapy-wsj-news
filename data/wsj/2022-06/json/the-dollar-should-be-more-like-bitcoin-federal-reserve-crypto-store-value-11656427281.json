    "body": "Max Raskin is correct that “Bitcoin isn’t going away because the ideology underlying it isn’t going away. There has always existed a strand in the American political tradition that is skeptical of the government’s ability to manage the money supply” (“Don’t Believe the Obits for Bitcoin,” op-ed, June 23). Congress should take note of this skepticism and question why people may want alternatives to the U.S. dollar and traditional banking system.<br />Setting aside the rise and fall of prices, the defining characteristics of bitcoin and cryptocurrency may offer some lessons for the dollar. For instance, stronger financial-privacy protections, faster payments and better transparency in monetary-policy governance could be good improvements. The U.S. has long benefited from the dominant position of the dollar, but that is a position that should not be taken for granted."
