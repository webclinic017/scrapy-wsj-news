    "body": "The next few years will mark a turning point for U.S. military operations in space. Starting with President Biden’s fiscal 2023 budget request, we are embarking on a journey to increase dramatically the capability and security of satellites that provide military leaders with crucial early warnings about possible attacks and track missiles after they’ve been launched. This will protect U.S. forces and realize the National Defense Strategy mandate to deter potential adversaries.<br />While the post-World War II rules-based order is under threat from Russia, the U.S. continues to face a formidable challenge from China. The U.S. Space Force is implementing a long-term plan to remain ahead of these strategic competitors by providing essential operational support to the rest of the military, protecting American troops, and preserving access and freedom to operate in space."
