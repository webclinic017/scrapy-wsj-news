    "body": "HONG KONG—China’s car sales began to rebound in May as production gradually resumed in lockdown-hit Shanghai and government cash incentives stimulated purchases in the world’s biggest auto market.<br />Passenger-car sales in May rose 30% to 1.35 million from 1.04 million vehicles in April, the China Passenger Car Association said Thursday. The total was still down 17% from last May, indicating that the industry has a way to go to restore its fortunes even as China’s economy is showing signs of recovery from punishing anti-Covid 19 lockdowns."
