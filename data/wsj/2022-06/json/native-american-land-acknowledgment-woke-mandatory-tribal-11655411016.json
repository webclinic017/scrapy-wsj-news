    "body": "Regarding Eugene Kontorovich’s “‘Native Land Acknowledgements’ Are the Latest Woke Ritual” (op-ed, June 11): I am a Mohican Indian who grew up on our tribal reservation in northern Wisconsin. Our ancestral lands, as anyone who has read James Fennimore Cooper may be aware, are in the Northeast. For many years I have felt that there needs to be some acknowledgment of the friendship our tribe offered European settlers, our bravery in fighting in the Revolutionary War on the side of the Patriots and the land we lost. But I’m not sure what form it should take.<br />I was raised on the reservation to have faith in God, love our country and admire the goals our Founding Fathers identified. Because of their ideas and the leadership of my ancestors, some of our tribe survived and I live in freedom today. I was taught to live my life fully, disregard the prejudice I sometimes encountered and not to wait for life to be perfect."
