    "body": "China’s real-estate sector has endured a constant barrage of bad news over the past couple of years. But investors jumping into property stocks now—after a rare piece of good news—may have gotten ahead of themselves.<br />Shares of Chinese developers soared Monday after data showed property sales jumping week over week. The number of property transactions in 30 selected cities rose 43% from the week before, according to data provider Wind. That shows the recovery from protracted spring lockdowns in Shanghai and other cities is continuing apace: the volume of transactions is now at a similar level around the same time last year. The Hang Seng Mainland Properties stock index rose 6.5% Monday, though it is still more than half off its peak."
