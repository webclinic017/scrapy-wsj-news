    "body": "LONDON—Wheat output in the European Union is expected to fall this year, according to a closely followed survey, threatening to crimp supply from one of the world’s biggest growers at a time when the war in Ukraine has bottled up exports from that country and from Russia.<br />The weak European forecast and war in Ukraine come ahead of what many analysts expect to be a smaller-than-usual harvest in other global bread baskets like India and Australia. A bad harvest in the EU could further pressure grain markets. Sharply higher prices have already roiled many developing countries that rely on imports."
