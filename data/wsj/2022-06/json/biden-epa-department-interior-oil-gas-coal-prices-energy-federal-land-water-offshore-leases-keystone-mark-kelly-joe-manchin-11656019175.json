    "body": "President Biden urged CEOs of the nation’s leading energy producers and refiners to take “immediate action” to increase the supply of gasoline. In a letter last week, he wrote that his administration “is prepared to use all reasonable and appropriate Federal Government tools and emergency authorities to increase refinery capacity and output in the near term.” Yet Mr. Biden’s own policies constrained energy supplies.<br />The U.S. is blessed with an abundance of oil, natural gas and coal that helped us win World War II and gave our citizens the highest living standards in the world. But American families are paying historically high prices at the pump. Mr. Biden can lead the nation out of this self-imposed energy crisis by returning to the policies favored by his predecessors and by many in our party."
