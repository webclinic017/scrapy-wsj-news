    "body": "‘The Bedwetter” surely ranks among the more unpromising titles for a musical. Then again, “Cats”—who knew?<br />And like that musical juggernaut—with which it otherwise has absolutely nothing in common—“The Bedwetter” makes good on the blunt promise of its title. Based on the comedian Sarah Silverman’s memoir of the same name, the show focuses on the plight of a 10-year-old girl, named not coincidentally Sarah Silverman (Zoe Glick), whose bladder is as leaky as her mouth is foul."
