    "body": "U.S. stock futures swung in a choppy trading session, pointing to more volatility ahead for major indexes as June trading kicks off.<br />Futures for the S&P 500 on Wednesday wavered between small gains and losses. Contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.3%, while those for the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 fell 0.2%, erasing gains from earlier in the day. On Tuesday, major U.S. indexes fell, leading the S&P 500 to end May roughly flat after a tumultuous month marked by major moves in both directions."
