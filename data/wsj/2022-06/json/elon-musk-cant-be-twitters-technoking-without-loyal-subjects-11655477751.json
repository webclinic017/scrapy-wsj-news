    "body": "Elon Musk has had his intentions to buy  Twitter  second-guessed by just about everyone in recent weeks, including himself, but Thursday’s question-and-answer session with the company’s thousands of employees showed his interest in the social-media platform remains strong. How willing thousands of Silicon Valley employees will be to work for the world’s richest, least-decisive man is another matter.<br />Just showing up was a good start for Mr. Musk. That admittedly is a low bar but, for someone who often skirts business decorum, and sometimes the rules, participation was hardly a given. He then described Twitter with what, for him, was an unusual amount of warmth. Whereas some people choose hairstyles to express themselves, he said he enjoys Twitter as a particularly effective megaphone for his ideas."
