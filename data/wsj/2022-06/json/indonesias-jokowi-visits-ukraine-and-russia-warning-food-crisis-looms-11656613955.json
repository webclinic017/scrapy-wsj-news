    "body": "SINGAPORE—Indonesian President Joko Widodo met with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Moscow a day after he held talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Wednesday—meetings in which Mr. Widodo said he appealed for peace and sought solutions to the global food-supply disruptions caused by war.<br />The visits to the two countries—the first by an Asian leader since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—symbolized efforts by a large swath of the developing world to avoid overtly criticizing Russia or be seen as picking a side. In remarks alongside Mr. Zelensky on Wednesday, Mr. Widodo, who is popularly known in his country as Jokowi, didn’t mention Russia by name or Moscow’s role in cutting off Ukraine’s Black Sea ports that has prevented Ukrainian grain from reaching global markets."
