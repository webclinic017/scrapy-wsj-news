    "body": "There is finally a way around the supply-and-demand imbalance in ride-share, but it might be cheaper for customers than investors. Car-share platforms Turo and Getaround, which allow customers to drive borrowed vehicles, are approaching the public markets in separate lanes.<br />Both were founded more than a decade ago. Turo filed for a traditional public offering in January while Getaround has chosen to merge with a special-purpose acquisition company,  InterPrivate II Acquisition Corp.  That transaction is expected to close in the second half of this year. Assuming both listings come to fruition, Turo and Getaround will face an uphill battle in the public markets as listed companies in what has become a very tough tape for tech. The ride-share sector itself has been especially out of favor after years of losses and despite glimmers of sustainable profitability."
