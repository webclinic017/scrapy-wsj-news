    "body": "In William Galston’s otherwise excellent column on the U.S. energy future (“Fuel Prices Aren’t Going Down Soon,” Politics & Ideas, June 8), he agrees with President Biden that there’s little the president can do to lower short-run prices. Completing the Keystone pipeline and other projects and opening up federal lands for oil and gas exploration, however, would signal a pause in the war on fossil fuels and have an immediate impact on the market price of crude and natural gas.<br />As everyone knows by now, the wind doesn’t blow all the time and the sun doesn’t always shine. For these to provide a reliable power source, they must either be backed up with traditional power sources—in which case the cost of the renewables is extremely high, as they provide minimal benefit beyond the traditional power-plants themselves—or achieve massive storage capacity for the energy generated during times of wind and sun abundance. This technology doesn’t currently exist at the necessary scale."
