    "body": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell listed holdings largely made up of stock funds and local government debt in his financial disclosure statement for 2021.<br />Mr. Powell’s disclosure doesn’t show any transactions in individual stocks or other securities. His form lists a number of transactions in funds for municipal debt securities as well funds that hold collections of stocks. Some of Mr. Powell’s transactions don’t have trade dates listed, but a Fed spokesperson said those transactions are tied to automatic reinvestments, a practice permitted by the government ethics office."
