    "body": "Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester said she favors continued aggressive interest-rate increases at the central bank’s next two policy meetings.<br />“Given economic conditions, ongoing increases in the fed-funds rate are called for,” Ms. Mester said in a speech text Thursday. “Unless there are some big surprises, I expect it to be appropriate to raise the policy rate another 50 basis points at each of our next two meetings.”"
