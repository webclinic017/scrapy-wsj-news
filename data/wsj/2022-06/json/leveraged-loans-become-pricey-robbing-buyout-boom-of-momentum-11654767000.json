    "body": "The debt-fueled buyout boom is running out of steam, as attractive financing for LBOs gets harder to come by.<br />After enjoying low-cost debt for years, private-equity firms are finding it more expensive to secure funding in the leveraged-loan market, the source of most of the capital they use to fund takeovers. The average yield to maturity on loans backing new leveraged buyouts has increased from roughly 5% last year to 5.7% so far this year, according to Leveraged Commentary & Data. Plans by the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates threaten to make the debt more expensive still."
