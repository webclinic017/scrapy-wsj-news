    "body": "The media and market chatter is that the Federal Reserve finally took out the anti-inflation bazooka with a 75-point rate increase on Wednesday, and there’s no doubt Chairman Jerome Powell sounded hawkish rhetorical notes. But the overall message still looked more like a central bank slouching toward inflation reality, but not yet convinced it has to do all that much to get prices under control.<br />The 75-point increase at a single meeting was supposed to signal shock and awe, and it was the Fed’s first move of that magnitude since 1994. Mr. Powell also said an increase of between 50 and 75 basis points is likely at its next meeting in July."
