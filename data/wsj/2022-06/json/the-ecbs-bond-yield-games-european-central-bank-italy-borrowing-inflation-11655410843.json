    "body": "What the European Central Bank taketh, it giveth back. That’s the message from Wednesday’s emergency meeting of the eurozone’s monetary policy makers, who have decided they’re not so single-mindedly focused on controlling inflation after all. Instead they’ll try to save Italy’s government from itself.<br />Witness a new subsidy the ECB concocted this week for bonds issued by fiscally rickety euro members. The central bank has wound down net bond purchases under its two quantitative-easing programs. But it won’t allow bonds to start running off its balance sheet at least until late 2024. In the meantime, the ECB announced Wednesday, it will divert maturing principal to new bonds issued by governments experiencing a run-up in yields."
