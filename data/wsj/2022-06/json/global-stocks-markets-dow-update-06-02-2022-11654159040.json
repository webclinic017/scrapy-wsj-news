    "body": "Crude prices fell ahead of a meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers led by Russia, at which the countries are expected to agree to boost production.<br />Futures for Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, traded down 2.2% at $113.74 a barrel, with the market expecting supply to rise following a meeting between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ 13 members and 10 non-OPEC producers Thursday. The U.S. and Europe have pressed the group, dubbed OPEC+, to pump more crude, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sent oil prices soaring above $100 a barrel."
