    "body": "In “Thoughts and Prayers Do Help” (op-ed, June 1), David Bashevkin urges us to see “prayer and its attending seriousness” as “part and parcel with taking action.” I agree that prayer may be part and parcel of taking action, but it isn’t always. My discomfort as a person of faith with politicians offering “thoughts and prayers” in the wake of school shootings isn’t because I don’t value the potency of prayer, but rather because these statements are offered as a cheap palliative by those who should be effecting meaningful change.<br />Rabbi Bashevkin quotes Lincoln: “I have been driven many times upon my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go.” Perhaps this is the issue; our leaders pray, overwhelmed by a conviction that there is nothing else to do, when there is so much yet to be done."
