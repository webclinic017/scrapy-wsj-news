    "body": "The Wall Street Journal reported last month that  Walmart ,  the nationâ€™s largest retailer, is struggling to find workers despite increasing salaries to more than $100,000 for truck drivers and more than $200,000 for store managers. Starting pay at Wall Street banks and top law firms has also risen significantly.<br />Small-business owners likewise are having trouble hiring and retaining workers even after boosting compensation. Fast-food restaurants are offering managers six-figure salaries to fill openings, while manufacturers pay signing bonuses and cover relocation costs, even for hourly positions."
