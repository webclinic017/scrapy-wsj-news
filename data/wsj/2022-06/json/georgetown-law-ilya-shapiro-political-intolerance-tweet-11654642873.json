    "body": "Kudos to Ilya Shapiro for his decision to part company with Georgetown Law (“Why I Quit Georgetown,” op-ed, June 7). The hypocritical excesses and unforgivable spinelessness of the progressives running higher education have become so extreme as to have achieved a state of dark comedy—very dark comedy. Why would anyone sensible want anything to do with an organization so lacking in integrity as Georgetown Law?<br />It was wise of Mr. Shapiro to shake the dust off his feet and turn away from Georgetown Law as it sinks ever deeper into its echo chamber."
