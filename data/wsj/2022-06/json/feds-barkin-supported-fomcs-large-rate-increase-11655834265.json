    "body": "Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Thomas Barkin said Tuesday he was on board with last week’s supersize rate rise by the Fed and expects more aggressive moves by the central bank as it seeks to lower high inflation levels.<br />“I was definitely supportive” of the 75-basis-point rate rise the Fed implemented last week, Mr. Barkin said in a virtual appearance. “We are in a situation where inflation is high, it’s broad based, it’s persistent, and rates are still well below normal…I think the spirit is you want to get back to where you want to go as fast as you can without breaking anything.”"
