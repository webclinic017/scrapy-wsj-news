    "body": "Although the luxury industry isn’t an obvious place to look for bargains, Gucci’s owner increasingly looks like a value stock.<br />Paris-listed luxury goods company Kering set new medium-term targets at an investor day Thursday. It wants to double sales at its second-largest label by sales, Saint Laurent, to €5 billion, equivalent to $5.3 billion at current exchange rates, and grow the French brand’s operating margin to 33% from 28% today. The company also plans to increase Gucci’s revenues by a further 50% to €15 billion a year—the current size of privately owned rival Chanel—and make its most important brand less vulnerable to fickle fashion trends by designing more classic products."
