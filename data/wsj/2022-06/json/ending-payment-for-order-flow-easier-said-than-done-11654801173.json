    "body": "Is it possible to ban payment for order flow without banning payment for order flow?<br />That is the question that has been raised by a series of changes to stock-market rules laid out by Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler this week. None of them are a straightforward prohibition of payment for order flow, or PFOF, which is the hotly-debated practice by retail brokerages like  Robinhood Markets  or  Charles Schwab  of sending customer orders to market-making firms such as Citadel Securities or  Virtu Financial  and collecting payments from those firms in return."
