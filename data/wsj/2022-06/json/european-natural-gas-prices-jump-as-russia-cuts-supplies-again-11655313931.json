    "body": "Europe’s options for filling its natural-gas stores to avoid a winter energy crisis are narrowing as flows from Russia decrease and U.S. shipments are poised to stall, sending gas prices higher.<br />Russia’s Gazprom PJSC said Wednesday that flows through the Nord Stream pipeline to Germany would fall further, a day after it cut exports on the route by 40%.
