    "body": "The environment has turned more noxious for European banks, but  Credit Suisse  can’t be considered the canary in the coal mine.<br />The Swiss bank warned Wednesday that it would make a loss in the second quarter in both its investment bank and the overall company. It mostly blamed a worsening macroeconomic backdrop in Europe and Asia, two of its key markets. While external factors won’t have helped, Credit Suisse also is trying to dig itself out of a series of holes of its own making. The bank’s shares were hit much harder than peers, down almost 6% in European morning trading compared with a roughly 1% fall in the European banking average."
