    "body": "Stocks have tumbled this year in the face of rising interest rates. But with inflation showing little sign of cooling, many investors fear corporate earnings could be the marketâ€™s next support to fall.<br />The S&P 500 has dropped 18% in 2022, its worst start to a year since 1962, as the Federal Reserve embarks on an aggressive rate-raising campaign to bring down sky-high inflation. The swift tightening of monetary policy has trampled on the rich valuations stocks carried at the start of the year, leaving earnings growth as a key pillar for the market to regain its footing."
