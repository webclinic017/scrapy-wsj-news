    "body": "T.J. Rodgers, whom I have admired for years as a free-market advocate who practiced what he preached, makes a convincing case against the pending petition to impose tariffs on solar-panel imports—until his last paragraph (“Tariffs Throw Shade on the Solar Industry,” op-ed, May 25). There he concedes that the 26% rooftop-solar tax credit is a hefty subsidy for solar-panel makers.<br />If tariffs on solar panels are so unfair, why am I required to pay my rich neighbors down the street and around the country a kind of domestic tariff, through my taxes, of nearly $5,000 on their $19,000 rooftop solar systems?"
