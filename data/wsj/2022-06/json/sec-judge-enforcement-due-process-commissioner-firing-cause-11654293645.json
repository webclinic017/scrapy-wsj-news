    "body": "In Jarkesy v. SEC, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that trying Securities and Exchange Commission cases before the SEC’s own tribunals violated the defendants’ right to a jury trial (“Constitutional Thunder Out of Louisiana,” Review & Outlook, May 23). Allowing the SEC to determine where to try cases was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.<br />Not seeking monetary damages might fix the jury trial issue. Legislation with specific standards might fix the delegation problem. But neither change would fix the due-process issue identified in the editorial: “that the SEC acted as prosecutor, judge and jury.” The SEC has a substantial interest in conviction and the judges it employs are well aware of that interest."
