    "body": "The bidding war over  Spirit Airlines  shows why “stakeholder capitalism” is a hard sell for investors.<br />On Wednesday, the U.S. carrier postponed a shareholder meeting scheduled for Friday that would have included a vote on the acquisition bid made by its competitor  Frontier Airlines .  Spirit’s board of directors retains a strong preference for this merger, which seems like a perfect cultural fit, over a rival one proposed by  JetBlue  Airways. But the board’s latest move betrays hesitation that shareholders might not put the same value on non-pecuniary factors."
