    "body": "In “King Richard,” the 2021 drama depicting the budding tennis careers of the Williams sisters, Will Smith’s character Richard Williams turns down so many huge opportunities for his daughter Venus that it makes your jaw drop. That worked out pretty well for her and her sister, Serena, in the end.<br />If only social-media platform Reddit—co-founded by Serena Williams’s now husband, Alexis Ohanian—had that kind of nerve and timing. Redditors took the market by storm last year, fueling a retail frenzy in meme stocks such as GameStop that turned investing fundamentals on their head, briefly making the WallStreetBets forum the center of the financial universe. Founded in 2005 in a dorm room, much like Facebook had been a year earlier, Reddit today is one of the most visited websites in the world with more than 50 million daily active unique users as of January."
