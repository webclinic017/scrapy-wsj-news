    "body": "Manny Huizar is remembered as a big-hearted guy by customers and co-workers at the Safeway in San Jose, Calif., where he worked. Last week the 24-year-old was shot and killed by a thief in the liquor aisle. He’s another victim of California’s Prop. 47, which has effectively decriminalized shoplifting.<br />Details about Mr. Huizar’s killing are murky, but some of his co-workers told the San Jose Mercury News that shoplifters would often brazenly walk out with carts of liquor. Managers told workers not to accost shoplifters, but one said he and Mr. Huizar would sometimes tell suspicious characters in the liquor aisle after 2 a.m. that it was “too late for liquor sales” in hopes of deterring them."
