    "body": "It has been 10 months since  Victoria’s Secret  spun off from  L Brands  and revamped its brand to be more women-centric. While the message is starting to resonate with consumers and Wall Street analysts, it is taking longer to reach investors.<br />Victoria’s Secret said on Tuesday that its total revenue declined 4.5% in the quarter ended April 30, at the high end of its own guidance and better than the 5.2% decline analysts polled by Visible Alpha expected. Chief Executive Officer Martin Waters said on a call with analysts on Wednesday that bras and beauty sales gained good momentum, as did international business as countries recovered from Covid-related restrictions."
