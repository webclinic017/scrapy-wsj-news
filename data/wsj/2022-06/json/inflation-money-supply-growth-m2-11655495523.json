    "body": "Regarding Mickey Levy and Charles Plosser’s op-ed “Inflation Demands Bold Fed Action” (June 15): Year-over-year M2 peaked at 27% in February 2021 and is currently up only 7%. Over several decades, inflation changes have lagged money changes by about 12 to 14 months. This indicates that a slowing rate of inflation is baked in the cake about a year out.<br />The Federal Reserve paid almost no attention to the explosion of money growth, which produced inflation. It now risks a recession if it ignores money growth’s slowdown."
