    "body": "With slow but steady Russian advances in the Donbas, the war for Ukraine has entered a new phase. The West must decide how to respond, now and in the long run.<br />After initial defeats, the Russians are waging war the only way they know how—with brute force. They are using their long-range artillery to pulverize key targets and to make it costly for concentrations of Ukrainian troops to hold their positions. Only after relentless shelling has softened their targets do Russian troops move in. Military analysts believe that this strategy has reduced Russian losses to a sustainable pace, and Ukrainian officials are not hiding their own rising casualty rates."
