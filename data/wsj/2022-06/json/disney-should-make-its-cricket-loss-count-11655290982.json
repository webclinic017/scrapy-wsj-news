    "body": "For  Disney ,  losing the streaming rights to India’s most popular cricket league could turn out to be a blessing in disguise—provided the company fully capitalizes on it.<br />The entertainment giant said Tuesday that it will keep the broadcast rights to the Indian Premier League’s cricket seasons from 2023-2027. But Disney lost out on streaming rights to those games, having been outbid by the Viacom18 joint venture partially owned by rival  Paramount Global .  The winning bid for just the streaming portion was $2.6 billion—18% above what the combined streaming and broadcast package fetched during the last auction in 2017. Disney picked up the rights to that deal with its 2019 acquisition of the movie and TV business of 21st Century Fox."
