    "body": "Your editorial “Jared Polis Bucks the Climate Lobby” (June 13) offers plaudits to the Colorado governor for vetoing an electric-vehicle-charging mandate. While that bill was misguided, and its demise is cause for celebration, it was vetoed only because a far worse bill had already made its costly mandates redundant.<br />H.B.1362, which was signed by Gov. Polis five days before his EV-mandate veto, will usurp authority from local governments across Colorado by imposing a statewide minimum standard for residential and commercial building codes, much like the cost-raising mandates the editorial cites in California."
