    "body": "Rudy Boschwitz treats Social Security reform as an administrative matter and offers simple but ineffectual “solutions,” all of which are Band-Aids (“Social Security Needs Saving Again,” op-ed, June 8). Social Security can only be fixed by recognizing that the challenge is an investment matter.<br />For generations, Congress has earned about 1.5% on the trillions of dollars it has confiscated from workers. Had Congress invested the money in government bonds the return would have averaged 3%, and 5% if invested in high-grade corporate bonds. Best of all would have been an investment in equities, where returns would have reached 9% a year. Had any of these returns been realized, Social Security would now be solvent and thousands more Americans could have retired as millionaires."
