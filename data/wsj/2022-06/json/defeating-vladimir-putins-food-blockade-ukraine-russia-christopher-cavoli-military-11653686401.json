    "body": "World leaders are raising alarms about Vladimir Putin’s food blockade in Ukraine that threatens global shortages and political unrest, but so far they’re doing too little about it. Credit U.S. Gen. Christopher Cavoli for addressing the problem more forthrightly than politicians have.<br />“The problem of exporting or not exporting grain from Ukraine right now is an important problem not just for Ukraine but for the world,” Gen. Cavoli said last week during his confirmation hearing to become NATO Supreme Allied Commander. “The way we approach that would have to be a whole-of-government approach, which may or may not include a military component.”"
