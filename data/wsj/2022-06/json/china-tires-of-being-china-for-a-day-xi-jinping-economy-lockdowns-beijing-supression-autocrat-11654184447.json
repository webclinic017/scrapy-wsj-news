    "body": "If Xi Jinping were a democratic leader, he’d be in terrible political trouble. Recent months have exposed the greatest weaknesses with Mr. Xi’s management of China’s economy at precisely the moment he intends to consolidate his political control. What follows is a morality tale concerning the perils of being an autocrat in a confused era.<br />The Chinese economy is on the ropes in a way it hasn’t been for a generation. Beijing won’t achieve its goal of 5.5% growth in gross domestic product this year, and that target already represented a grudging concession to economic gravity when it was announced. Despite a few recent bright spots, such as modestly improving business sentiment, most economic signs are negative."
