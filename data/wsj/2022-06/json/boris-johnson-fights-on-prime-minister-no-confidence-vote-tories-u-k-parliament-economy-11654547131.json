    "body": "That Boris Johnson survived Monday’s snap no-confidence vote within his party is a testament to the British Prime Minister’s charisma and cunning. That he faced the vote at all is a sign that he and his Tory Party remain in grave political danger, and for reasons conservatives in other parts of the world can learn from.<br />The intraparty vote was triggered when at least 54 Conservative members of Parliament—15% of Mr. Johnson’s caucus—expressed dissatisfaction with Mr. Johnson’s leadership. It’s a remarkable development only two-and-a-half years after he won a historic parliamentary majority of 80 seats, including districts that had never voted Tory. Mr. Johnson prevailed Monday 211-148, but the fact that 41% of his own party no longer have confidence in him will prove terminal unless he executes a turnaround."
