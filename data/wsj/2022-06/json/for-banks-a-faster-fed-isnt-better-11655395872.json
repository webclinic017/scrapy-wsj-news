    "body": "The early part of a rising rate cycle tends to be the sweet spot for banks. This time around, it might be brief.<br />Higher rates benefit banks because the rates they charge to lend typically adjust much faster than the rates they pay for funding like deposits. Now that the Federal Reserve appears to be getting more aggressive, the risk is that a faster pace of rate increases could shorten this window."
