    "body": "Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Chairman Richard Glick denied taking orders from the White House when he rushed through regulations mandating climate reviews for new natural gas pipelines and liquefied natural gas terminals. Documents shared with us raise questions about that answer.<br />The Institute for Energy Research obtained Mr. Glick’s meeting calendar  from Nov.  8, 2020, through this past April 19 via a Freedom of Information Act request. Not surprisingly, it includes many meetings with utilities, energy providers and FERC staff. But starting last September, he began holding biweekly meetings with Deputy White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi."
