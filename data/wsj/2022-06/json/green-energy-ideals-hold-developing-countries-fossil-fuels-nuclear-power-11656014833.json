    "body": "Bjorn Lomborg is correct to call out “The Rich World’s Climate Hypocrisy” (op-ed, June 21). But he conflates power production with electricity distribution. In the case study in Dharnai, India, the issues have as much to do with the shortcomings of microgrids as with the power source.<br />Many lower-income countries will be able to avoid continuing to build out a fossil-fuel-based power system. This will have myriad benefits—fuel cost savings, cleaner urban air, increased utility revenue and decreased energy-import costs."
