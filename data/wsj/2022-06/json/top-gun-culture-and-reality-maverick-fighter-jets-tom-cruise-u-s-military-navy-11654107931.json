    "body": "‘Top Gun: Maverick” crushed box-office debut records over Memorial Day weekend, and it’s worth asking why. Could this be an entertainment phenomenon that says something larger about the current moment in American culture?<br />No doubt many are showing up to see Tom Cruise, who plays U.S. Navy fighter pilot Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, as he did in the original “Top Gun” in 1986. But the movie’s opening weekend outperformed the box office for Mr. Cruise’s other hits such as the “Mission: Impossible” franchise. It’s no easy feat to stick the landing of a sequel more than three decades after the first movie."
