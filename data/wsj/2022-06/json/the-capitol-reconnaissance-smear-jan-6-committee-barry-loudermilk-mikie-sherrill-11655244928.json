    "body": "If the Jan. 6 select committee wants to have more bipartisan credibility, how about apologizing to Georgia Rep. Barry Loudermilk? The Republican was vindicated this week after false accusations that he had provided “reconnaissance” tours for Capitol rioters.<br />On Jan. 12, 2021, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill (N.J.) alleged on  Facebook  that she’d seen “members of Congress who had groups coming through the Capitol that I saw on Jan. 5 for reconnaissance for the next day.” The press piled on."
