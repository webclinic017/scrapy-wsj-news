    "body": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has picked another fight with progressive corporate America, this time the Tampa Bay Rays baseball team. When he signed the state budget last week, Mr. DeSantis zeroed out $35 million to help build a new site for the Rays’ spring training. “I don’t support giving taxpayer dollars to professional sports stadiums, period,” he said Friday.<br />This is a good policy that too few states emulate, and Florida taxpayers can be grateful that their Governor has a line-item veto and is willing to use it. He vetoed $3 billion in earmarks and pet legislative projects. But Mr. DeSantis also muddied his message by citing another reason to defund the Rays. “It’s also inappropriate to subsidize political activism of a private corporation,” he said."
