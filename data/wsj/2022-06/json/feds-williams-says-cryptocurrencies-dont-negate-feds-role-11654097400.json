    "body": "Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said Wednesday financial markets have priced in a lot of central bank rate rises and it is up to the U.S. central bank to ratify that situation with continued rate increases.<br />“The fact that market interest rates have moved above their prepandemic benchmarks while the policy rate has not can be read as an illustration of the effect of credible forward guidance,” Mr. Bullard said in materials for a presentation. “The Fed still has to follow through to ratify the forward guidance previously given, but the effects on the economy and on inflation are already taking hold,” he said."
