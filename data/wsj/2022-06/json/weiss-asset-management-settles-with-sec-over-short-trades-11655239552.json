    "body": "Fund manager Weiss Asset Management in Boston has agreed to pay roughly $6.9 million to settle allegations from the Securities and Exchange Commission that it unlawfully bought securities from public offerings too soon after shorting the same stocks, according to a news release.<br />The SEC said Weiss violated a rule that bans short selling stocks during a restricted period surrounding a public offering. Weiss miscalculated the periods, with “ill-gotten gains totaling over $6.5 million,” the SEC said."
