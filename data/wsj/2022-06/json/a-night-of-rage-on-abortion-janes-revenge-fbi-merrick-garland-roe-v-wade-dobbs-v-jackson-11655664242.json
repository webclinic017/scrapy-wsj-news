    "body": "As the nine Justices prepare to issue their final opinions of the current term, barricades are going up around the Supreme Court building.

Demonstrators continue to protest outside the homes of some Justices, and now comes a vow from the shadowy group that calls itself Jane’s Revenge to commit what sounds like what Democrats would call insurrection if it were aimed at another part of government."
