    "body": "The people of Buffalo’s East Side deserve credit for their hard work in recent years to revitalize their neighborhoods (“As Buffalo Redevelops, East Side Is Left Behind,” U.S. News, June 21). As a TV news journalist, I have done over 30 stories about this historic area. East Side Avenues, a private-public partnership, began with $65 million allocated by the state for a well-planned revitalization, and donations keep coming. Implementation began in 2019 and hasn’t stopped.<br />An important initiative that this effort established was the Real Estate Development Training Program. One East Side resident used the knowledge she gained from it to begin transforming her 1800s building into a mixed-use property combining retail and housing. Projects like hers provide much-needed job opportunities."
