    "body": "For over a year, the Biden administration insisted inflation was transitory, played it down as “high-class problems” and implemented policies that made it worse. Now, President Biden finally lays out a plan (“My Plan for Fighting Inflation,” op-ed, May 31).<br />How does he begin? Blame the Federal Reserve: “My plan has three parts. First, the Federal Reserve has a primary responsibility to control inflation,” the president writes. So much for “the buck stops here.”"
