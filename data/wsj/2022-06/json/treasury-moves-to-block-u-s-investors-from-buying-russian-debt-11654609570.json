    "body": "The U.S. Treasury moved to block U.S. investors from making purchases of Russian debt in secondary markets, an apparent expansion from existing policy that only prohibited purchases of newly issued Russian government debt and some Russian corporate debts.<br />In new guidance, the Treasury Department said U.S. persons remain prohibited from new investment in Russia, which now includes “purchasing both new and existing debt and equity securities issued by an entity in the Russian Federation.” Investors would still be allowed to sell or transfer securities as long as they do so to a non-U. S. counterparty, according to the Treasury, and they can also continue to hold the already issued debt."
