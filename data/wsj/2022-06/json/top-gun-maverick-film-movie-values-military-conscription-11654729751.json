    "body": "The plot of the highly successful movie “Top Gun: Maverick” could never happen in real life today (“‘Top Gun’ Culture and Reality,” Review & Outlook, June 2). Rather than destroy a uranium-enrichment plant, U.S. leaders would timidly beg the rogue nation to stop. Then they would send billions of dollars in aid. The rogue nation would redirect the funds toward the plant, to eventually create nuclear bombs and the missiles to deliver them. Does this sound familiar?<br />Perhaps the major attraction of the movie is that a group of patriots recognize the threat of genuine evil. They lay their lives on the line to destroy an enemy facility regardless of personal consequences. The things missing in our leaders today are a recognition of evil, the resolve to confront it, and the courage to act."
