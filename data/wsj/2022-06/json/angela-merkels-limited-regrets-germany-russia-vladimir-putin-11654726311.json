    "body": "Rarely has a foreign policy legacy been discredited as rapidly, and thoroughly, as former German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s. In 16 years at the top of the German government, she thought she could moderate Vladimir Putin’s imperial ambitions, and in the process she made Germany and Europe vulnerable to his energy blackmail.<br />But as for regrets, she hasn’t a few. That was clear from her first major public appearance since she left as Chancellor last year."
