    "body": "Russia failed to meet its obligations to creditors when it didn’t make a small interest payment in April, according to an industry body overseeing the derivatives market, a ruling that triggers some $2.2 billion in credit-default swaps.<br />Wednesday’s decision marks the first formal recognition within financial markets of a Russian debt default after its invasion of Ukraine caused the U.S. and its allies to impose broad financial sanctions, severing Moscow’s access to foreign bank accounts and global payment systems."
