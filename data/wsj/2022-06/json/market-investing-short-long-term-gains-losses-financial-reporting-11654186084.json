    "body": "It is depressing to see how much emphasis the financial press and social media put on tales of extreme gains and losses over short time horizons (“Tech’s Half-Baked Acceptance of Reality,” Heard on the Street, May 26). From high-profile investors such as Cathie Wood, to U.S. teenagers trading leveraged call options from their parents’ basement, monthly, weekly and even daily returns are now a source of headline news.<br />Fetishizing short-term performance is irresponsible. The industry risks perpetuating the cycle of short-termism that destroys the long-term returns of many investors. Sadly, such articles are often most influential on those new to investing, and whose future financial security is least secure. What kind of message does it send if major publications are consistently evaluating performance over insignificant time horizons? It perpetuates the hype cycle, driving flows into already inflated assets and encouraging realization of losses at the depths of the subsequent drawdown."
