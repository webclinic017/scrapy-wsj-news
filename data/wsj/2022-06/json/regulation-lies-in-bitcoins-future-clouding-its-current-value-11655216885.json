    "body": "The long-term case for bitcoin is being hit on all sides right now.<br />With bitcoin trading more than 65% below its peak, the debate sparked by previous down cycles about whether it can be a reliable long-term store of value will continue. Of course, one bitcoin is still worth over $20,000—and traditional reserves such as gold have had their own peaks and plunges. But the value proposition for now still lies in a series of speculative bets: that bitcoin will prove out as a store of value through future cycles; that it is a risk asset that can offer competitive returns compared with assets like stocks; or that it will turn out to be actually useful in important and sustainable ways."
