    "body": "After months of ignoring oil consumers’ calls to turn on the taps, OPEC+ has finally agreed to step up production targets. But the real winner of the deal appears to be Saudi Arabia, not motorists.<br />The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a Russia-led group of producers on Thursday agreed to increase crude production by 648,000 barrels a day in both July and August, compared with 432,000 barrels a day each month according to their earlier pledge. But the stepped-up target follows a decline in Russian oil production since Moscow invaded Ukraine in late February."
