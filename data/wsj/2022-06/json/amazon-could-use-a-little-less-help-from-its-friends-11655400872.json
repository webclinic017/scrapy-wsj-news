    "body": "Sometimes, being nice isn’t being helpful.<br />Wall Street has been awfully nice to  Amazon  even as the e-commerce giant faces its greatest business challenges in years. Those challenges—most notably an overbuild of its fulfillment network just as pandemic-boosted demand started slipping—have resulted in Amazon losing 40% of its market value over the last 12 months. That is by far the worst performance among trillion-dollar market cap tech peers  Apple ,  Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet, the three of which have averaged a loss of about 6% in that time."
