    "body": "At the World Economic Forum in January, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called for a “modern supply-side approach” to maximize America’s economic potential. She said the U.S. must adopt policies that will increase the supply and productivity of workers. She’s right about the goal but wrong about the policies.<br />An accurate diagnosis of what is affecting the labor market requires careful attention to chronic and acute problems. One chronic problem is that the share of adults working or looking for work has been generally falling for the past 20 years. Most of this decline has been driven by baby boomers’ entering retirement, but that doesn’t explain it all. Another significant factor is that men of prime working age, 25 to 54, are less likely to work today than those of previous generations."
