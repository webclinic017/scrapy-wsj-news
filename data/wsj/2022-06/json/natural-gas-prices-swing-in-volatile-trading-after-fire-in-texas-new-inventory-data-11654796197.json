    "body": "Government data showing low natural-gas inventories helped prices rebound Thursday after a sharp decline Wednesday that followed a fire at a Texas fuel-export facility, which will reduce overseas shipments this summer.<br />Prices for the power-generation fuel had notched a 14-year high on Wednesday when news of a fire at one of the country’s largest liquefied-natural-gas export facilities sent them crashing down. They fell more than 16% before the Energy Information Administration’s weekly inventory report Thursday showed little progress in filling up domestic storage facilities ahead of summer air-conditioning season and the losses were pared."
