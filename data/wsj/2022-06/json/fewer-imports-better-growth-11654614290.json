    "body": "With Americans shifting spending away from goods, fewer imports will be hitting U.S. docks. The U.S. economy could end up growing more quickly as a result.<br />The pandemic set off heavy demand for all manner of consumer goods, as people reduced their spending on things like travel and dining out, tried to make the homes they were hunkered down in more livable, and were provided with government relief payments that made it easier to spend. A lot of those goods were made abroad."
