    "body": "The older I get, the more “You’re Gonna Miss This,” country musician Trace Adkins’s beautiful ballad about family life, rings true. Released in 2008 and played consistently in my kitchen since then, the sublime song stresses the importance of appreciating all of life’s moments, even the messy ones. Today’s troubles, the tune teaches, become tomorrow’s treasures.<br />This wise counsel has classical roots. In Book One of Virgil’s “The Aeneid,” Trojan hero Aeneas, after the fall of Troy, rallies his storm-tossed and cityless countrymen with these fateful words: Forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit—“Someday it will be pleasing to recall even these things.” Hard times eventually end and when they do, they’re recollected differently. As a father, I’ve tried very hard to heed this lesson."
