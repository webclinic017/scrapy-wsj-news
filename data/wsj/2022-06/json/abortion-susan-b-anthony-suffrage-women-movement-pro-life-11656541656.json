    "body": "Neither Susan B. Anthony nor Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote any of the antiabortion letters or articles that Colleen Kelly Spellecy and Eric Anthony cite in “Yes, Susan B. Anthony Was Pro-Life” (op-ed, June 14). Neither suffragist left any “extensive” writings on abortion. Neither took a public stand on the issue because they and other suffragists wanted to keep discussions about sex far away from the conversation about suffrage.<br />Some of these articles were written by Parker Pillsbury, Stanton’s co-editor at the Revolution, or by the newspaper’s financier, George Francis Train. Others were merely reprints from other publications to finance the weekly publication of Anthony’s cash-strapped paper."
