    "body": "Regarding your editorial “China’s Great Naval Leap Forward” (June 8): It may be that as the U.S. exaggerated Russian military power, the same is occurring with China. Much of China’s navy consists of small Type 22 patrol boats. In striking power, the U.S. Navy is, and will remain, far superior.<br />Nevertheless, the decline in U.S. naval numbers—and the same is true for the other services—reflects a dilemma that may not be resolved by money alone. Over the past 60 years, the more the U.S. spends on defense, the more the force shrinks."
