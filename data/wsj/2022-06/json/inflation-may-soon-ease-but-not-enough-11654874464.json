    "body": "Friday’s inflation headlines look scary. When it comes to some of the things they buy, Americans are probably about to see some substantial relief. Still, that alone won’t be enough to convince the Federal Reserve it can ease up on the magnitude of rate increases by the fall.<br />The Labor Department on Friday said that consumer prices rose 1% last month from April, putting them 8.6% above their year-earlier level for the largest gain in 40 years. Much of that had to do with the substantial increase in the price of gasoline; prices excluding food and energy items—the so-called core that economists use to try to discern inflation’s trend—rose a smaller 0.6%. That put core prices up 6% from a year earlier, which is somewhat more modest than the gains registered in the prior three months, though still uncomfortably high."
