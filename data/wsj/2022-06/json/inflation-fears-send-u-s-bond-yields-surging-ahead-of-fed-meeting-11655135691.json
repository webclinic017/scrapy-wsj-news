    "body": "U.S. government-bond yields closed at their highest levels in more than a decade on Monday, propelled by fears that persistent inflation could push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates even higher and faster than already expected.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled at 3.371%, according to Tradeweb, its highest close since April 2011 and up from 3.156% on Friday. The yield on the two-year Treasury—which often rises with expectations for Fed rate increases—rose to 3.279%, a new 15-year high, from 3.047% on Friday."
