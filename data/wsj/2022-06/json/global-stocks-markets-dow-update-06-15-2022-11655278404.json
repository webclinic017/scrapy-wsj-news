    "body": "Stock futures rose ahead of the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates, while European markets advanced after the European Central Bank called a meeting to address bond-market disruption.<br />Futures for the S&P 500 added 0.5% Wednesday, pointing to gains for the broad index at the open. The S&P 500 fell into a bear market—a decline of more than 20% from its January peak—this week as mounting expectations that the Fed would raise rates faster than previously signaled sent a shudder through markets."
