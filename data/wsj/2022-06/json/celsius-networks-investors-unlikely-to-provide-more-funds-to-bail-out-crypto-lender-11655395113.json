    "body": "Investors in Celsius Network LLC are unlikely to provide more financing to bail out the struggling cryptocurrency lender, said people with knowledge of the situation.<br />A big Canadian pension fund, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, and WestCap Group, a growth-equity firm founded by technology investor Laurence Tosi, a former chief financial officer of  Airbnb Inc.,  aren’t expected to put in more money to help the crypto lender, these people said. WestCap and Caisse de dépôt last year led a Series B funding round that raised $750 million for Celsius and valued the crypto startup at more than $3 billion."
