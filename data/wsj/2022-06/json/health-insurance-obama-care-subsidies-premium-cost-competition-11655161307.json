    "body": "Your editorial “When ‘Temporary’ Subsidies Are Forever” (May 31) on extending pandemic-driven subsidies for health coverage bought by individuals claims that health-insurance providers would “jack up” premiums. These subsidies reduce consumer premiums, helping individuals and families access affordable coverage, but they don’t affect how premium rates are set.<br />By law, health-insurance providers offering marketplace coverage must spend at least 80 cents of every premium dollar on medical care. That means the cost of services—prescription drugs, doctors’ visits, prevention—directly correlates to premiums."
