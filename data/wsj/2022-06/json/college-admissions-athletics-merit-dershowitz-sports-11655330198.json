    "body": "Alan Dershowitz is correct that “Colleges Need Merit-Based Admissions” (op-ed, June 2). It’s for the sake of the student. Twenty-eight percent of the students who drop out of college do so because of academic disqualification. The biggest disservice a college can do to a young person is admit him knowing that his test score or grade-point average is going to set him up for failure because he simply doesn’t have the academic acumen for that college. Flunking out can be a traumatic event.<br />Richard Eggers"
