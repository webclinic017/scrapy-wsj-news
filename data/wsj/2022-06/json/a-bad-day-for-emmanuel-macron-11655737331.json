    "body": "The French political system is designed to empower the President, and Emmanuel Macron has enjoyed sweeping authority in his first five years in the Elysée Palace. But legislative elections on the weekend ensured his second term will be far more complicated.<br />Mr. Macron easily won a second mandate in April, but on Sunday his allies lost control of the National Assembly. His centrist Ensemble block won 245 seats, well short of the 289 needed for an absolute majority. It’s a significant fall from the 350 Mr. Macron’s group won in 2017."
