    "body": "Metals prices are up, but mining companies aren’t spending. Their restraint could keep supplies tight and magnify shortages of raw materials such as copper and zinc that are critical for the transition away from fossil fuels.<br />Project spending by 10 large mining companies, including  Rio Tinto PLC ,   BHP Group Ltd.  and  Glencore PLC ,  is expected to stay at roughly $40 billion this year and next year, according to figures compiled by  Bank of America Corp .  That would put capital expenditures well below a 2012 peak close to $80 billion, the bank’s figures show."
