    "body": "Democratic Rep. Karen Bass was widely expected to walk away with the race to become the next mayor of Los Angeles. The progressive former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus has endorsements from government unions, Democratic activists and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Then along came Rick Caruso—a onetime Republican, prominent city real-estate developer and philanthropist—and Ms. Bass is no longer a certain bet.<br />The race now is a clash of visions: the progressive ideologue vs. the liberal pragmatist. If no candidate wins a majority of votes in Tuesday’s nonpartisan primary, the top two finishers will face off in November’s general election."
