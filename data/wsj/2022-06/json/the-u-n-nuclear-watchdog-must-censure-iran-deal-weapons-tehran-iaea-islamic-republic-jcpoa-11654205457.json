    "body": "Iranian officials plotted in the early 2000s to deceive the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and defeat its inquiries into Tehran’s covert nuclear weapons program. The Journal reported last week that the Islamic Republic even stole internal IAEA documents, the better to organize its deceptions. Iran has also stonewalled, for nearly four years, a new, little-publicized IAEA investigation into its covert nuclear activities, and the watchdog reported Monday that Tehran has not answered questions about its undeclared nuclear work. These revelations underscore how foolish President Biden has been in negotiations over a new nuclear deal. To enforce transparency, he must push for the IAEA to censure Iran when its members assemble on Monday.<br />The Biden administration has focused its diplomatic efforts on reviving the expired 2015 nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The Biden administration and officials from France, Germany and the U.K. have discussed the prospect of a new deal with the Iranians, but Tehran has shown little interest in compromising. Still, the U.S. and its European allies have withheld IAEA censure—which would insist that Iran comply with the agency’s investigation or else the issue could be referred to the U.N. Security Council—lest it disrupt negotiations."
