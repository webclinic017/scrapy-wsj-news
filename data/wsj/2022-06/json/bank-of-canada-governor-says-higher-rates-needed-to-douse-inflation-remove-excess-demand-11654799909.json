    "body": "OTTAWA—Bank of Canada Gov. Tiff Macklem said the economy needs interest-rate increases to douse historically high inflation and remove excess demand from the economy, especially in the housing sector where sales and price growth were unsustainably elevated during the pandemic.<br />Mr. Macklem reiterated the need for higher rates, and the central bank’s resolve to move quickly and forcefully if necessary, at a press conference in Ottawa on Thursday following the release of the central bank’s annual assessment of risks to the domestic financial system. A good chunk of that report, the Financial System Review, focused on the vulnerabilities posed by more households that are financially stretched after the purchase of a home, and elevated house prices, which the central bank said, for the first time, reached “exuberant” territory in most Canadian cities during in the first quarter."
