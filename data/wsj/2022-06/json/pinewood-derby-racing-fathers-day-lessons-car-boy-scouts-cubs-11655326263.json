    "body": "At the ripe old age of 11, I learned an important lesson from my father: While failure can be bitter, success can be more so.<br />It was May 1968, and I was in sixth grade. I participated in a local Boy Scouts of America pinewood derby, a car-racing competition held by local Cub Scout chapters. Boys, often with a parent’s help, design and carve miniature wooden cars, which race on sloped tracks, since the cars are powered by gravity alone. The fastest cars win trophies and ribbons, and there is often a separate award for best design."
