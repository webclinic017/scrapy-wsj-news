    "body": "As California goes, so goes the progressive movement in America, and on Tuesday it suffered a major political rebuke. The recall of left-wing prosecutor Chesa Boudin in San Francisco and the rise of mayoral candidate Rick Caruso in Los Angeles are apt punishment for progressive policies that have produced rising urban anarchy.<br />With votes still to be counted, voters sent Mr. Boudin packing with some 60% of the vote. The prosecutor had ridden into office as a champion of criminal-justice reform, which in practice turned out to be little or no prosecution for crimes that have made San Francisco streets a showcase for drug abuse, vagrancy, homeless camps, shoplifting and assault on the innocent."
