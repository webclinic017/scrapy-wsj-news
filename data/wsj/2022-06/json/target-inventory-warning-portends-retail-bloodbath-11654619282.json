    "body": "Target ’s  inventory problem is turning out even worse than it expected just a short time ago. Its latest warning could portend a promotional bloodbath among retailers this summer.<br />The retailer on Tuesday lowered its operating-margin guidance for its second quarter to 2%, less than half the margin it telegraphed three weeks ago. The company said it is taking actions to “right-size” its inventory, which will involve more discounts and canceling orders."
