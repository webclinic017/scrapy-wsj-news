    "body": "Bond salesmen working out of strip malls across America pitched  GWG Holdings Inc.  as a good investment. The company would use money raised from bond sales to buy life-insurance policies from people who wanted cash up front, then collect the payouts when those people died. Investors, many of them elderly and retired individuals, put $1.3 billion into the bonds.<br />What many of these retail investors didn’t know was that GWG’s founders and a board director would each use the money to fund and launch their own startup ventures, then move them out of the investors’ reach, according to people familiar with the matter. The roughly 27,000 individuals who bought GWG’s unique debt securities, known as L Bonds, are now facing huge potential losses – for many, their retirement nest eggs."
