    "body": "Regulation is justified when it serves the public interest, but it is frequently motivated by the economic self-interest of powerful groups. Economists call this the “bootleggers and Baptists” phenomenon—those likely to profit from trade in illicit alcohol push for regulation alongside the moralists hoping to protect the vulnerable.<br />The battle over the future of derivatives markets, playing out now at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is a modern-day example. The debate revolves around a proposal from FTX, a licensed derivatives exchange, to permit the offering of futures contracts on margin, which would be subject to a new way of calculating collateral and of handling margin calls."
