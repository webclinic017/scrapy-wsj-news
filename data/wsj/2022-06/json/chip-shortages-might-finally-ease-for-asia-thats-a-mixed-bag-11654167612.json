    "body": "The good news: The chip shortage of the past two years could be easing. That, however, is bad news for Asian economies and companies along the tech supply chain. Headwinds to chip demand are now gathering force in both China and the U.S.<br />The slowdown in China’s economy and shuddering momentum in the American technology sector will dent demand for electronic devices from both consumers and businesses. Shipments of smartphones and personal computers have already begun falling on a year-over-year basis. Smartphone shipments dropped 8.9% on the year in the first quarter while PC shipments were down 5.1%, according to industry tracker IDC."
