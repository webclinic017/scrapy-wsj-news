    "body": "There could soon be as many as two approved Covid-19 shots for the littlest Americans. But investors in vaccine-makers’ shares, which have suffered amid a broader selloff in the biotechnology sector, won’t be able to breathe any easier.<br />Some anxious parents are holding off on a full return-to-normal until their little ones get inoculated. One could therefore be forgiven for thinking there might be a sizable national market for  Pfizer - BioNTech  and rival  Moderna ,  both seeking authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration this month for children under five years old."
