    "body": "They say the superrich are different, and the same goes for their favorite sports-car maker. Ferrari, which launched a new strategic plan Thursday, must keep it that way.<br />When the Italian company announced its last such plan in 2018, its big challenge was to make a sport-utility vehicle that is different from the others. The result—its Purosangue or “thoroughbred” model—finally will be unveiled in September. New Chief Executive Benedetto Vigna’s key message Thursday was that the model, which it has never described as an SUV, will look and drive like a Ferrari sports car."
