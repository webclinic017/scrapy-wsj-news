Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 10:00 ET and 17:00 ET.<br />1546 ET - A Biden administration plan to allow a two-year waiver on some solar import tariffs is expected to mostly benefit the big, utility-scale solar industry, but Evercore says “the US residential solar industry, which has faced a wave of negative macro/regulatory headlines since December 2021, will also likely benefit.” For one thing, it eases panel procurement challenges, and for another it “removes the need to create tariff reserves if the DOC investigation [which created the supply-chain issues leading to the tariff break plan] outcome is unfavorable,” Evercore says in a research note.  Sunrun ,   Sunnova Energy ,   Sunpower  and  Enphase Energy  are some of the home solar firms that should benefit, it says. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)"
