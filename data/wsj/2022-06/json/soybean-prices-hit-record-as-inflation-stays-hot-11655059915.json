    "body": "Soybean prices have soared some 30% this year to a record, a surge that promises further pain for consumers facing the most severe bout of food inflation in a decade.<br />The continuous contract for soybeans on the Chicago Board of Trade ended trading Thursday at $17.69 a bushel, topping the previous high of $17.68, set in September 2012 when drought scorched the U.S. crop. The price fell modestly Friday, as traders pulled back from many markets following another red-hot U.S. inflation reading that intensified fears of sharper Federal Reserve interest-rate increases."
