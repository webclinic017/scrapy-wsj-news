    "body": "As Christians in Owo, Nigeria, gathered to celebrate Pentecost on Sunday, gunmen burst into St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church and began shooting. Eyewitness reports suggest at least 50 parishioners, including young children, were killed.<br />The shock waves of this massacre are still reverberating through Nigeria’s Christian community, a group already reeling from a flood of recent violence. Four weeks ago a mob of Muslim students beat to death Deborah Samuel, a young Christian woman accused of offending Islam after sharing the message “Jesus Christ is the greatest. He helped me pass my exams” on a WhatsApp messaging group."
