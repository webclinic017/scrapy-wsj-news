    "body": "John Cochrane is correct that our inflation is attributable to the excessive government spending in the wake of the pandemic (“The Fed Can’t Cure Inflation by Itself,” op-ed, June 28). He is wrong, however, in suggesting that the inflation reflects a loss of faith that the U.S. will repay its debt.<br />The issue isn’t whether the U.S. will repay its debt, but whether it can service the debt. The interest cost of the debt is currently about 1.5% of U.S. gross domestic product, which is half its postwar peak of 3% of GDP."
