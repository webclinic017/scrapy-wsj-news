    "body": "Filming police officers within 8 feet soon will be considered a misdemeanor offense in some cases in Arizona after Republican Gov. Doug Ducey signed into law a bill prohibiting certain recordings of law-enforcement activity.<br />The law bans people from recording police if those filming are within 8 feet of officers and have received a verbal warning. It defines law enforcement activity as officers questioning suspicious people, conducting an arrest or generally enforcing the law."
