    "body": "Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler has his regulatory eye on cryptocurrency markets, and he’s taking investors hostage in the process. That’s the best way to explain the agency’s blockade of spot bitcoin exchange-traded products, or ETPs.<br />We’re agnostic on crypto, including bitcoin, as long as investors are willing to invest at their own risk. Crypto investors have taken big losses recently, but the market is evolving and financial firms want to serve investors who like the innovation."
