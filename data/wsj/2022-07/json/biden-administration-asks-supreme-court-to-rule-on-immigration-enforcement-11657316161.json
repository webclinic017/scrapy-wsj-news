    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration asked the Supreme Court Friday to reinstate immigration enforcement guidelines that a lower court blocked after Texas and Louisiana filed suit arguing that the policy lets too many noncitizens with criminal records go free while their cases are processed.<br />The guidelines focus detention efforts on noncitizens deemed to threaten national security, public safety and border security. They provide criteria for immigration officers making detention decisions, such as the nature of the crime previously committed and whether a person is of “advanced or tender age,” has served in the U.S. military or has family members who would suffer if a caregiver was removed."
