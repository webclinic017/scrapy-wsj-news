    "body": "Progressives in California have taken ride-share companies hostage to their climate agenda. Now  Lyft  is trying to escape by sticking up high-income taxpayers. Witness the November ballot initiative the company is bank-rolling to soak the affluent to subsidize electric vehicles that the state has mandated for its drivers.<br />The deceptively titled Clean Cars and Clean Air Act last week qualified for the general election ballot after getting an $8 million charge from San Francisco-based Lyft. The initiative would raise the top income-tax rate on earners making more than $2 million by 1.75 percentage points to 15.05%, giving California the highest rate in the country after New York City (14.8%) displaced it last year. Quite the honor."
