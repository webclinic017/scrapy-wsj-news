    "body": "Los Angeles’s Rodeo Drive may be among the toniest stretches of luxury real estate in America, but it features very few American fashion brands. The handful includes timeworn titans like Tom Ford and Ralph Lauren—but also on the block is one 8-year-old label nipping at their heels: Amiri.<br />The Los Angeles brand is one of the fastest-rising businesses in American luxury fashion. According to its 45-year-old founder Mike Amiri, the label will do $250 million in sales this year—a 56% increase from the year before. In 2023, it is projected to do $320 million in sales."
