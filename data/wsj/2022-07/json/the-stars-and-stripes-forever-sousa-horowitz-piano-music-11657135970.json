    "body": "John Edward Hasse’s interesting and informative history of composer John Philip Sousa’s “The Stars and Stripes Forever” (“Patriotism, Energy and Optimism,” Masterpiece, July 2) recognizes classical pianist Vladimir Horowitz’s arrangement for solo piano. When I was a young piano student, my father bought concert tickets to hear Horowitz on April 18, 1951, at Hill Auditorium at the University of Michigan.<br />We arrived in Ann Arbor and heard Horowitz perform an outstanding program of Haydn, Brahms and Chopin, concluding with a brilliant interpretation of Mussorgsky’s “Pictures at an Exhibition.” By that time, the audience of 3,500 (plus standing room only) were pleading loudly for an encore."
