    "body": "Progressives upset with the Supreme Court’s recent rulings are quick to call it partisan. But then how do they explain the Court's decision to uphold a Biden immigration policy despite valid concerns about chaos at the border?<br />In Biden v. Texas on Thursday, the Court voted 5-4 to uphold the President’s decision to cancel the Remain in Mexico policy. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the three liberals. President Trump started the Migrant Protection Protocols program in 2019 to remove migrants from the U.S. while their asylum claims are processed. It led to the expulsion of thousands of border crossers, and likely deterred many more from attempting the journey."
