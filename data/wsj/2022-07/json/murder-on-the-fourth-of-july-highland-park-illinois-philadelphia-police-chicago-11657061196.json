    "body": "The press is understandably focusing on the awful shootings at a Highland Park, Ill., Fourth of July parade that killed seven and wounded more than 30. Police arrested 21-year-old Robert E. Crimo III, and Lake County Sheriffâ€™s Office Deputy Chief Christopher Covelli said Tuesday that authorities believe he had planned the shooting for weeks. The alleged shooter fits the profile of many such culprits: young, male loners who offered hints of their future killing sprees on social media.<br />As it happens, Illinois has some of the toughest gun restrictions in the United States, and a separate Highland Park ordinance also restricts AR-15s, AK-47s and other semiautomatic weapons. Mr. Covelli said Tuesday that authorities believe Mr. Crimo obtained his weapons legally within the state."
