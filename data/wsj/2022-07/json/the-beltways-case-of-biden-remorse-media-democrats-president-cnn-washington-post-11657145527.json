    "body": "For readers who aren’t consumed with politics—and bless you for it—you might want to know that something remarkable is happening in Washington. Democrats and their media allies are having a bout of buyer’s remorse—over President Biden.<br />It seems they’re disappointed that the one-time scrapper from Scranton isn’t the chief executive they thought he’d be—and, after 18 months of a united front, they are finally venting their frustration in public. A pair of notable pieces this week in Democratic Party favorites—CNN.com and the Washington Post—relate how the White House is a mess, and the President isn’t the strong and angry leader the times demand."
