    "body": "Parents haven’t let up in their push for greater school choice, and Virginia reflects the growing momentum. The state’s latest budget includes funding for new flexible public schools meant to meet the demand for alternatives.<br />Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin cited “record investments in education” while signing the two-year budget last month, but the details deserve more attention. The centerpiece is $100 million to open new “lab schools.” These are publicly funded K-12 schools founded by public universities, rather than school districts. That puts them outside the state’s collective-bargaining agreement, meaning each lab school’s administrators control hiring and pay."
