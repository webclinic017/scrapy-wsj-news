    "body": "Even San Francisco has had it with the lawlessness, and last month voters recalled progressive district attorney Chesa Boudin. On Thursday Mayor London Breed appointed as his replacement Brooke Jenkins, who has called for a tougher response to crime. Wish her luck.<br />On Thursday Ms. Jenkins told the local NBC affiliate that she wants to “set a new tone where people understand, no, we are not indifferent to crime, that there is accountability in San Francisco . . . and if you commit crime here, there are consequences.”"
