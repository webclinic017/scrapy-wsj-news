    "body": "My wife and I lost our first child. We had a “missed miscarriage.” Our baby died at 6 weeks, which we learned at our 12-week ultrasound. As we waited for the miscarriage and mourned our baby, we didn’t know what we would do with the remains. But a funeral seemed appropriate.<br />That isn’t necessarily easy. When a woman undergoes a dilation-and-curettage procedure, which removes tissue from the uterus, at a hospital, she needs to insist that staff give her the remains—“products of conception” in the medical lingo. If the remains aren’t given to the parents, they are often treated as medical waste and could be incinerated. Some women who miscarry at home flush the remains."
