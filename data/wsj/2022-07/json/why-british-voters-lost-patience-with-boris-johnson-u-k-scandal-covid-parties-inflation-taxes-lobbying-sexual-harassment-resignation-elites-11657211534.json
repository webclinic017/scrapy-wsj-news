    "body": "To the outsider, the precipitous collapse of Boris Johnson’s political fortunes this week must be utterly baffling. He became the U.K.’s prime minister only in summer 2019 and in December of that year led his Conservative Party to a historic election victory with a majority of 80 seats in Parliament. Two and a half years later, he’s out on his ear.<br />Don’t worry if you’re confused, because plenty of veteran observers of British politics are too. To Mr. Johnson’s many critics, his dishonesty—finding expression in a casual flippancy about policy and politics that matched his careless appearance with that infamous mop of blond hair—was disqualifying from the start. Why do polls suggest voters started noticing only in the last few months?"
