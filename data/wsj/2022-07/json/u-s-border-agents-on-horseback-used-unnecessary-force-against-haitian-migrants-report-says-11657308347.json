    "body": "WASHINGTON—Border Patrol agents on horseback used unnecessary force against Haitian migrants in Del Rio, Texas, last September, as the agents sought to prevent them from joining more than 15,000 Haitians being held under a bridge there for processing, according to an internal review by U.S. Customs and Border Protection released Friday.<br />Agents involved in the widely publicized incident were acting at the request of Texas state police—contradicting Border Patrol objectives, according to the report. It doesn’t say whether the four agents involved will be disciplined, though they were placed on administrative leave. CBP officials, speaking to reporters Friday morning, said a separate review board is still deciding what form of discipline would be appropriate."
