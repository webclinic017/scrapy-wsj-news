    "body": "The shares of several companies that have agreed to be taken private are trading at larger-than-normal discounts to their announced deal prices, which might reflect concerns that transactions could be renegotiated after steep stock-market declines, according to research analysts and merger-arbitrage specialists.<br />“The reason why buyers may try doing this is because the markets are down so much,” said Aaron Glick, a director at investment bank Cowen & Co. and a merger arbitrage specialist, referring to potential buyout renegotiations."
