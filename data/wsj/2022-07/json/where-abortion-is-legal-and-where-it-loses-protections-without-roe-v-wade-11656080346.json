    "body": "The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to an abortion.<br />The majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization upends nearly five decades of precedent and allows stronger state restrictions to take effect—including total abortion bans. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have been preparing for the shift for years, bringing laws forward that further restrict or assert protections for abortion."
