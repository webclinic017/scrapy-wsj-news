    "body": "Military regulations guarantee religious freedom, but the Pentagon is defying them. More than 24,000 members across the branches have submitted religious-accommodation requests following Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s August 2021 vaccination order. Almost all have been rejected. These troops now face punishment and discharge.<br />Many religious personnel are Christians who object to using abortion-derived cell lines to develop or test medical products. That precludes them from taking any of the four Covid-19 vaccines the Food and Drug Administration has authorized so far."
