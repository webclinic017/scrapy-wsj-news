    "body": "Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said he is ready to follow the U.S. central bank’s supersize June rate rise with the same thing at the end of this month.<br />“Our goal has been to move to neutral expeditiously” when it comes to the central bank’s short-term interest-rate target, Mr. Bullard said Thursday. “I think it would make a lot of sense to go with 75 [basis points] at this juncture” when considering rate increases at the Fed’s July 26-27 policy meeting."
