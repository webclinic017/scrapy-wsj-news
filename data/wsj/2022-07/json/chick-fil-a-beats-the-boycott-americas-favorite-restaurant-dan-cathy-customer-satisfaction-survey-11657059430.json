    "body": "Even the Fourth of July was politically polarized this year, as various celebrities and  Twitter  grandees let the world know how much they dislike America. But maybe there’s still hope for political accommodation if we can judge by the latest from the American Customer Satisfaction Index.<br />The survey found that Chick-fil-A remains America’s favorite restaurant for the eighth year in a row. The fast-food chain specializing in chicken fare came in with a score of 83 on a scale of 100, well above other chains that scored 79 or less. Chick-fil-A’s popularity is all the more impressive given that Americans say they prefer full-service restaurants to fast-food joints."
