    "body": "Barton Swaim, in his review of John Mauceri’s book “The War on Music” (June 17), cites the lack of new music that “any normal person would want to hear” as one reason for declining audiences at classical musical performances. Yet many older works now heard and loved by audiences today were initially received with derision. The Milan performance of Rossini’s “Barber of Seville” in 1816 was greeted by an audience that shouted, heckled, hissed and jeered.<br />Historical norms in music have evolved from one period to the next, each time stretching the bounds of the previous. In the 20th century, composers pushed beyond common concepts of melody and harmony. For years, the obsession of musical gatekeepers with being new, bold and cutting edge largely defined what got heard from contemporary composers. The result? Works that were perhaps intellectually stimulating, but also lacking in the emotional content to satisfy many concertgoers—though certainly not all."
