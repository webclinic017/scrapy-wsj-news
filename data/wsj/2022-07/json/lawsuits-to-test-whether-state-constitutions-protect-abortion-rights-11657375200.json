    "body": "The U.S. Supreme Courtâ€™s decision last month ending the federal constitutional right to abortion has prompted advocates for abortion rights to look anew at state constitutions, setting up legal battles over whether the protections found in Roe v. Wade exist at the state level.<br />Providers and legal advocacy groups so far have filed about a dozen lawsuits in state court that seek to head off broad abortion restrictions. The suits cite an array of provisions in state constitutions, including ones that offer privacy guarantees and protections against discrimination based on sex."
