    "body": "Nearly 108,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2021. That figure  is an extraordinary increase in recent years: In 2016, it stood at just over 60,000. It’s been called an epidemic, but its victims weren’t unwitting. They opted into it. Ignoring this distinction has led to drug-addiction therapies that haven’t capitalized on the psychological factors that underlie drug use.<br />Addictions begin when people start using drugs for medical or recreational reasons, then take additional doses of substances they knew are dangerous. In his 1947 book, “Opiate Addictions,” University of Indiana sociologist Alfred Lindesmith found that human users become addicts when they realize that their painful withdrawal symptoms are the consequence of not having the drug in their bodies."
