    "body": "Uncertainty over Sri Lanka’s leadership set in on Sunday as protesters continued to occupy the president’s residence a day after they stormed it, and President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s whereabouts remained unknown.<br />The president hasn’t yet directly addressed an announcement by the speaker of the parliament that Mr. Rajapaksa would resign on Wednesday. His only communication since massive protests overran his official residence was a statement from his office ordering officials to expedite the distribution of a shipment of natural gas due to arrive Sunday."
