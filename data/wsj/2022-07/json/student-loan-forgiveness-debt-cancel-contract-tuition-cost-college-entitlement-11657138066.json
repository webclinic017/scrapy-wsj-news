    "body": "Phil Gramm and Mike Solon speak the truth: “Student Loan Forgiveness Is a Political Bribe” (op-ed, June 30). But their analysis doesn’t go far enough. If loans to today’s students are forgiven, tomorrow’s students will have every reason to expect the same break—and woe betide the politician who says no to them. Student-loan forgiveness will create a colossal new entitlement, without Congress having passed a single line of legislation.<br />The real beneficiaries won’t be the students but the colleges and their administrators. They will be told that, in effect, the sky is the limit with regard to what they charge, because Uncle Sam is footing the bill. This will be a huge transfer of taxpayer money to a Democratic Party constituency."
