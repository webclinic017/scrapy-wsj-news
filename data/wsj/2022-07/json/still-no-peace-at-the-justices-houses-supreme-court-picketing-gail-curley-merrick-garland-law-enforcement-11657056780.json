    "body": "When it comes to shielding Supreme Court Justices from intimidation by a mob, the buck apparently stops nowhere. Marshal of the Court Gail Curley has written to officials in Virginia and Maryland, warning that “protest activity at Justices’ homes, as well as threatening activity, has only increased.”<br />Virginia law bans picketing private residences or assembling to “disrupt any individual’s right to tranquility in his home.” Ms. Curley cites that statute in letters to Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Fairfax County. She says that last week dozens of protesters were outside the Justices’ homes, yelling “no privacy for us, no peace for you!” and chanting expletives. “This is exactly the kind of conduct that Virginia law prohibits,” Ms. Curley adds."
