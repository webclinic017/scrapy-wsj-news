    "body": "Washington is crazytown these days, as protesters harass Supreme Court Justices at home, and this week they pursued Justice Brett Kavanaugh while he was having dinner at a Morton’s steakhouse (see Notable & Quotable nearby). Will this finally be enough to get Congress to act to better protect the Justices and their families?<br />The Senate returns Monday after a two-week recess, and the first order of business should be passing legislation that funds security to protect the Justices’ families. House Democrats waylaid the bill before the break in what seemed to be an act of spite for the decision overturning Roe v. Wade."
