    "body": "“It’s really important for couture to be reflective of the times that we are in,” mused actor Julia Fox, vaping in a barely-there Mugler ensemble while in Paris during the haute couture shows this past week. She said that the collections she’d seen, including Schiaparelli and Iris van Herpen, felt relevant. And, to her, worth it—even if just to borrow: “People think couture is super overpriced, but the feeling that it gives you when you put it on is priceless. And in today’s day and age, you need to go where it feels good.”<br />Is Julia Fox—performative and charming—a modern-day Wallis Simpson, one of the most famous clotheshorses of all time? Ms. Simpson, the Duke of Windsor’s consort known for frequenting 1930s and ’40s couture houses such as Mainbocher and Balenciaga, was an invisible star of the new exhibition at Paris’ Musée des Arts Decoratifs, “Shocking! The Surreal World of Elsa Schiaparelli.” The show displays her most celebrated gown, a collaboration between Ms. Schiaparelli and Salvador Dalí featuring an erotic lobster."
