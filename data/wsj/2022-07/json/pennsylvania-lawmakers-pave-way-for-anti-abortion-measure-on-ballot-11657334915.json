    "body": "Pennsylvania legislators passed a bill Friday that helps pave the way for a referendum on whether to exclude protections for abortion from the state’s constitution, setting up a potentially yearslong fight over abortion rights in the politically divided state.<br />Both chambers of the state’s Republican-led legislature voted to pass a bill that could allow voters to consider a constitutional amendment saying there is no right to an abortion, or a right to taxpayer funding for the procedure. The bill passed the state’s Senate by a vote of 28 to 22, and the House by a vote of 107 to 92."
