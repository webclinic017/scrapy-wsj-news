    "body": "The story of a New York City bodega employee charged with murder for protecting himself from assault is a sorry sign of the Big Apple times. Progressive District Attorney Alvin Bragg routinely offers leniency to criminals, but he threw the book at the bodega clerk.<br />Press reports say the July 1 dispute began when a woman’s payment card was declined as she tried to buy a bag of chips. Video shows her shouting at bodega worker Jose Alba that her boyfriend “is gonna come down here right now and f— you up.” The boyfriend, 35-year-old Austin Simon, entered the bodega, and security-camera footage shows him confronting Mr. Alba and shoving and grabbing him."
