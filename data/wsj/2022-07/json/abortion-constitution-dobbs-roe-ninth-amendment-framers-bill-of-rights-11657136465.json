    "body": "Gerard Baker informs us that “Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the decision overturning Roe, found no right to abortion in the Constitution,” (“The Supreme Court’s War on Life, the Universe and Everything,” Free Expression, July 5). The implication is that if a right isn’t enumerated in the Constitution, it doesn’t exist. The express language of the Ninth Amendment, however, as well as the words of James Madison, James Wilson and others demonstrate that the founders had no such belief.<br />Madison and other framers didn’t want to attach a Bill of Rights to the Constitution. They feared that if it was listed, people and the courts would conclude that only those rights were protected and everything else was fair game for government attack. Attaching the Bill of Rights became necessary when the states, especially New York, insisted that one be included as their price for approval of the new Constitution. Going back to the 1688 Glorious Revolution, Englishmen had become used to the idea of a bill of rights, and many were included in the colonial state constitutions."
