    "body": "Considering all that’s going on in the U.S. now—economic distress, killings, street protests—President Biden’s Fourth of July remarks were remarkably disunifying. “In recent days,” he said, “there’s been reason to think that this country is moving backward, that freedom is being reduced, that rights we assumed were protected are no longer. A reminder that we remain in an ongoing battle for the soul of America.”<br />Mr. Biden is of course referring to one thing—the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade, the decision identifying a constitutional right to abortion."
