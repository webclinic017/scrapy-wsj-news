    "body": "TOKYO—Japan voted Sunday in a parliamentary election that politicians on all sides said would demonstrate the nation’s commitment to democracy after the killing two days earlier of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.<br />The election, which will fill half the seats in Parliament’s upper house, isn’t expected to change the makeup of the current government, led by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of the Liberal Democratic Party in coalition with a smaller party. The LDP has ruled with little challenge since it returned to power in 2012 under Mr. Abe’s leadership."
