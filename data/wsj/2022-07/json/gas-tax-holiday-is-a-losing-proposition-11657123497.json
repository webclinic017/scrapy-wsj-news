    "body": "I don’t like $5 a gallon gasoline any more than any other beleaguered U.S. motorist, but I am disappointed to learn that the president wants to address the situation by suspending the federal gasoline tax of 18.4 cents a gallon (“U.S. Gas-Tax Holiday Faces Resistance,” U.S. News, June 23). This action is gimmickry, pure and simple.<br />There are many reasons a federal gas tax suspension is a bad idea: 18.4 cents a gallon is peanuts in the grand scheme of things; it is robbing the fund that provides for road and bridge maintenance, whose revenue has withered as it hasn’t increased with the cost of living in almost 30 years despite vehicles having become much more fuel-efficient; and there is no assurance that gasoline retailers will drop the price of fuel despite the suspension of the levy."
