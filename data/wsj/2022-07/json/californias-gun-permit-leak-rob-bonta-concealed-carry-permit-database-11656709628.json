    "body": "California gun owners are up in arms, so to speak, after a state Justice Department website this week leaked their personal information. Didn’t Attorney General Rob Bonta assure the Supreme Court last year that his office could be trusted to safeguard the personal information of nonprofit donors?<br />The Fresno County Sheriff’s Office on Tuesday said it had been informed of a massive data breach affecting California concealed-carry permit holders. Mr. Bonta stumbled in a day later and revealed that the names, birth dates, driver’s license numbers, addresses and criminal histories of every Californian who had applied for a permit between 2011 and 2021 had been leaked."
