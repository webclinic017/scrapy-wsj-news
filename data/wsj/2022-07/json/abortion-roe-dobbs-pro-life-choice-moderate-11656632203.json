    "body": "Regarding Rebecca Sugar’s op-ed “My Mind Isn’t Made Up About Abortion” (June 28): I attended college during the full-throated women’s-lib era in the early ’70s. While women today have unfettered access to an array of near-infallible female contraceptive choices for consensual sex, we mostly didn’t. In hindsight, I believe we impressionable ’70s college coeds got far more societal and peer pressure to exercise sexual freedom than was wise or good for us.<br />Yet no matter how enthusiastically we explored that freedom, my friends and I never confused abortion with birth control. We recognized an overriding priority to control our reproductive capability through responsible contraception, not termination. Abortion, although legal until fetal viability, remained the most desperate of last resorts because intentionally aborting our fetus felt like murdering our baby—tragic, traumatic, life-changing and a somber choice grieved regardless of rationale."
