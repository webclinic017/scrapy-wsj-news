    "body": "Four months from the November midterm elections, President Biden is plumbing the depths of unpopularity. Only 39% or so of Americans approve of the job he’s doing.<br />Some Democrats appear to think abortion politics will save them, as suburban women revolt against the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade. They’re renewing their campaign to pack the High Court with two or maybe four more Sonia Sotomayors. A member of President Biden’s commission on Court reform, former federal Judge Nancy Gertner, is saying she’s “deeply frustrated” with Mr. Biden for failing to meet the moment."
