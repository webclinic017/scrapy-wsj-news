    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Fannie Mae’s New Racial Bias” (June 14): Decades of discriminatory housing policies resonate today in racial wealth and homeownership gaps. Throughout the 20th century, government assistance for homeownership elevated working-class white families to the middle class. The Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae, the Federal Home Loan Banks and later Freddie Mac facilitated lenders in originating low-down-payment mortgages. But both government and lenders discriminated against blacks.<br />The Fannie Mae plan to offer down-payment assistance is a direct remedy to the discriminatory practices. The Biden administration should be applauded for working to right this grave wrong."
