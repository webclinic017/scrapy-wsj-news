    "body": "On Boris Johnson, a bad man met a bad end. He was shallow, frivolous, insincere even for a politician, almost purely cynical, believed in little but himself. Because of this the things he got right had the shadow of the merely performative. He led a Tory Party that no longer seems to believe in anything, that doesn’t know what it’s about. It is not certain he was taken down by better men and women. I see nothing sad in his leaving but that he was very entertaining and had one of the best political acts—shambolic upper-class boyo, utterly lost in his personal sphere, just like you and no better than you—in modern British history.<br />But he was unserious. To have a really great act, you have to be a serious man. Almost oddly, that’s not something you can fake. People can see."
