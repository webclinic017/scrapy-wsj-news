    "body": "LONDON—Britain’s next prime minister will have to contend with challenges in governing the country that are arguably unequaled since at least 1979, when Margaret Thatcher took office facing galloping inflation and a battle with powerful trade unions.<br />Whoever succeeds Boris Johnson is confronting the largest drop in real incomes in the U.K. since the 1950s, with inflation forecast to touch 11% before the end of the year.
