    "body": "In “Trump and Biden Both Face Rejection” (Declarations, June 25), Peggy Noonan heaps praise on the Jan. 6 hearings for yielding a “coherent story” of President Trump’s culpability. That is easy to do when only one side gets to present evidence, call witnesses and disregard potentially exculpatory evidence.<br />A striking parallel exists between the Jan. 6 hearings and the Biden administration’s proposed Title IX rule. Both condone procedural unfairness and call it justice."
