    "body": "Protesters demanding the resignation of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa breached police barricades and stormed his official residence as public anger mounts over his government’s handling of a deepening economic crisis.<br />Braving tear gas and water cannons in the capital, Colombo, protesters—many waving the national flag and wearing helmets—also entered the president’s office on Saturday, in one of the largest antigovernment demonstrations in the country this year. Mostly peaceful demonstrations have been held daily outside the office since March."
