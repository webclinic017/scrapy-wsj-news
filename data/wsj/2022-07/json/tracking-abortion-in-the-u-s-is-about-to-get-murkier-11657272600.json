    "body": "The Supreme Court’s ruling eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion is sure to alter the numbers on abortion in the U.S. But we might not know by how much. Statistics on abortion are about to become unreliable at precisely the moment the public is most interested in them.<br />The majority opinion released last month in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a federal right to abortion. As a result new restrictions, including total bans, can go into effect in 22 states. And while that is expected to lead to fewer abortions, it might become hard to distinguish an actual decline from a decline in how many abortions are counted."
