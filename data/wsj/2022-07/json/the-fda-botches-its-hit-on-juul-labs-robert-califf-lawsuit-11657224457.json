    "body": "The Food and Drug Administration last month gave Juul Labs what amounted to a death sentence without a trial. Now after being sued, the agency has stayed its execution while it apparently seeks evidence to support its conviction. Abusive is an understatement for this botched political hit.<br />Democrats have targeted Juul for some time, and its putative original sin was hooking young people on nicotine. It tried to assuage critics by stopping sales of fruity flavors in stores and social-media marketing. Last year two-thirds of the roughly 20% of high-school seniors who reported vaping nicotine used other brands."
