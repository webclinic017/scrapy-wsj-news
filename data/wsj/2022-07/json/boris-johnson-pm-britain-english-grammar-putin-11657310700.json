    "body": "The headline of Walter Russell Mead’s column, “‘If Putin Was a Woman. . .’” (Global View, July 5), grates in my ear, trained for sixth-grade English grammar. Clearly, the headline calls for the subjunctive mood: If Putin Were a Woman. Why? Because it is stating a condition contrary to fact: If Putin were, but in fact, he is not.<br />But then I read further and saw that Mr. Mead and your editors can be held harmless. You were merely quoting British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who in one sentence managed to confuse his English grammatical moods as badly as his coif. “If Putin was a woman,” speculated Mr. Johnson, “which he obviously isn’t, but if he were. . . .”"
