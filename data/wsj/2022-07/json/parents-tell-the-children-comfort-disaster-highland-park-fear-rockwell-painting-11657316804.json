    "body": "The closest I’ve come to what the parents in Norman Rockwell’s 1943 painting “Freedom From Fear” were feeling, as described by Bob Greene (“Highland Park and ‘Freedom From Fear,’” op-ed, July 6), was the evening of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. I clearly recall the dread I felt that the next day would bring even worse news and more tragedy. Living directly outside Washington, I especially regretted bringing my two young girls so close to a potential target area.<br />Yet when my wife and I sat in bed that night with each child, we expressed none of that fear. We told our girls that we had faith in our country, its leaders and its military to stop the “bad men” who had threatened us. And we prayed together, and then again, alone and silently, that what we told them would be true."
