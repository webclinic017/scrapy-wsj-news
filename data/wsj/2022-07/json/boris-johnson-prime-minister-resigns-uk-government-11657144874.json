    "body": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would resign once a successor is chosen, after senior members of his government turned against him and urged him to stand down following a series of scandals. It is a stunning reversal for a politician who has dominated politics since the campaign to pull the U.K. out of the European Union, and leaves the ruling Conservative Party with a difficult choice—who should replace him?<br />Mr. Johnson decided to step down after senior cabinet ministers, including Treasury chief Rishi Sunak, and a long list of junior officials resigned, making it difficult if not impossible for him to run the government. He tried to hold on for a while, but as the departures mounted it became clear he would have to leave if the government was to get back on its feet."
