    "body": "The news leaking from the White House is that President Biden may finally ease tariffs against some Chinese goods—a mere 18 months into his Administration. The extended indecision underscores that Mr. Biden essentially has no trade policy while the rest of the world moves ahead with new trade deals.<br />Mr. Biden’s China policy demonstrates his trade paralysis by political analysis. Asked during the 2020 campaign if he’d keep Donald Trump’s tariffs, Mr. Biden said, “No. Hey look, who said Trump’s idea’s a good one?” He said they harmed U.S. manufacturing and agriculture, but in office he has failed to act."
