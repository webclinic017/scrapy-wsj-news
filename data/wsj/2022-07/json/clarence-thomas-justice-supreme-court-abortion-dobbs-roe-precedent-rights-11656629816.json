    "body": "Justice Clarence Thomas has been predictably but erroneously pilloried for writing in his Dobbs concurrence that other precedents—including the rights to contraceptives, same-sex marriage and consensual gay sex—ought to be reversed. But that’s not quite what he wrote (“Abortion Goes Back to the People,” Review & Outlook, June 25).<br />Instead, Justice Thomas noted that those precedents relied on the doctrine of substantive due process, which he and many legal scholars believe to be incoherent. Alternatively, the justice would inquire whether those same rights might be upheld under the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the 14th Amendment, something that libertarians have been advocating for decades."
