    "body": "Regarding Peggy Noonan’s column “The Courage of Cassidy Hutchinson” (Declarations, July 2): Ms. Hutchinson may be a wonderful person, but her appearance before the Jan. 6 committee was neither courageous nor heroic. It takes no courage to walk into a friendly room and tell the people sitting there exactly what they want to hear. Neither is it heroic to speak to a set of specifics for which she had no firsthand knowledge, as Ms. Hutchinson often did.<br />Little in Ms. Hutchinson’s testimony is admissible anywhere other than the court of public opinion, which is exactly where the Jan. 6 kangaroo court is conducting its trial of Donald Trump."
