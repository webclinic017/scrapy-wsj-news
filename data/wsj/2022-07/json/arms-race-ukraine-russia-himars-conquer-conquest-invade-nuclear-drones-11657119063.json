    "body": "Rich, sedentary civilizations have always been vulnerable. Plato wrote that the gods destroyed Atlantis because it had grown wealthy and debauched. The more a civilization produces, the more alluring a target it becomes: Bronze Age kingdoms fell to the sea peoples; Germanic barbarians took apart the Roman Empire; the Mongols conquered China’s empires. In the Islamic world the succession of Umayyads, Abbasids, Mamluks and Ghaznavids reflected Ibn Khaldun’s cyclical theory of history—bloated sedentary economies get dismantled and consumed by predatory barbarians.<br />This cycle was broken by the development of firearms. Technological advance became an instrument for successful conquest. The Vikings left North America because of the ferocity of the natives, but the next wave of invaders conquered the Indians with ease. The difference? Guns."
