    "body": "The U.S. Treasury market sent out another warning signal about the U.S. economic outlook Tuesday.<br />The difference between the two-year and 10-year Treasury notes turned negative—it was at negative one basis point at 5 p.m. E.T.—and created what’s called an inversion of the yield curve. That is when the normally positive relationship between these two yields flips, and it is a key metric for market participants, as yield curve inversions have a very strong track record of predicting downturns."
