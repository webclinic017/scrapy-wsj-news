    "body": "The children, a boy and a girl, are tucked safely into bed. Their mother leans over them, a soothing yet worried expression on her face. Their father stands beside her, in his hand a newspaper with the banner headline screaming the word HORROR.<br />They are parents trying to comfort their children in a brutal, violent world. They are depicted in a painting done almost 80 years ago, which quickly became talked about from coast to coast. The artist was Norman Rockwell and the title was “Freedom From Fear.”"
