    "body": "Cassidy Hutchinson is a conservative Republican (“More Testimony on Trump’s Jan. 6 Tirade,” Review & Outlook, June 29). More important, she is a proud American. When a 20-something former White House staffer knows more about right and wrong than the likes of Mark Meadows, Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman, Mike Flynn, Peter Navarro, Kevin McCarthy and numerous Republican congressmen, something is horribly wrong.<br />Because Ms. Hutchinson put country before party, I believe America owes her a huge debt of gratitude."
