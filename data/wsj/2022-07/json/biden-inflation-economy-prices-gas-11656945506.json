    "body": "We demonize presidents when the economy flounders and lionize them when it flourishes. It’s understandable Alan Blinder wants to break this habit (“Biden Isn’t to Blame for Inflation,” op-ed, June 29). But extraordinary policies call for unflinching scrutiny.<br />Others have done a fine job showing how President Biden is complicit in stimulating demand and constraining supply (Letters, July 1), the inevitable result of which is price hikes. There are many sins of commission. But let’s not overlook the sins of omission. The president could have embraced a policy agenda to spare us the pain of dollar depreciation."
