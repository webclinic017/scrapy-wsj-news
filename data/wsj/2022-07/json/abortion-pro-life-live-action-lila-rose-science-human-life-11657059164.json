    "body": "In “My Mind Isn’t Made Up About Abortion” (op-ed, June 28), Rebecca Sugar argues that pro-life Americans “confuse moral and ethical arguments with scientific ones.” She quotes me: “The science is conclusive. Human life doesn’t begin at birth. It begins before birth, at the moment of fertilization.” I stand by this statement.<br />Pro-life Americans reference the science of when human life begins because it is essential to resolving the moral and ethical question of abortion: Does it intentionally end an innocent human life? Science shows us that from the moment of fertilization a single-cell human embryo comes into existence. The embryo is alive and growing, and it is an individual of the human species—a unique human life, only younger and less developed than a born child or a toddler."
