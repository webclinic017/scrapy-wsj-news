    "body": "Public outcry over the Biden Education Department’s onerous proposed rules for charter schools seems to have had some effect. The final rules, published Wednesday, mollify some concerns of charter advocates but still put a needless burden on non-union public schools seeking federal funds.<br />The rules concern applications to the $440 million Charter Schools Program, and the proposals released in March read like a union list of impossible obstacles. A charter had to show “unmet demand” for the school, such as over-enrollment in district schools; proof of “collaboration” between the charter and a district school; and “plans to establish and maintain racially and socio-economically diverse student and staff populations.”"
