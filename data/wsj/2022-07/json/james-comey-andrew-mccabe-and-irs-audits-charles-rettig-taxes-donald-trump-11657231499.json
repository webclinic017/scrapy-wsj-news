    "body": "The press corps is aflutter at the  New York Times  report this week that former FBI officials James Comey and Andrew McCabe faced burdensome tax audits under a Trump appointee. We’re glad to see the new attention to the Internal Revenue Service, and welcome to the cause if you mean it.<br />Messrs. Comey and McCabe were rotten public servants, but any abuse of the IRS for political purposes has to be punished and deterred. The pair tangled with President Trump after investigating him for alleged collusion with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign."
