    "body": "New York<br />It’s not just the ghost of a murdered king who hovers at the fringes of Robert Icke’s staging of “Hamlet” at the Park Avenue Armory. Another presiding spirit might be detected by avid theatergoers: the Amsterdam-based director Ivo van Hove. Mr. Icke’s production, with its use of live video and other flashy technology—as well as the Bob Dylan songs somewhat incongruously seasoning the proceedings—recalls Mr. Van Hove’s radical approach to staging the classics and his many productions seen in New York."
