    "body": "SEOUL—North Korea claimed its first Covid-19 outbreak began after two people touched “alien things,” state media said Friday, blaming exposure to what they said were virus-tainted balloons that had been sent over the border from South Korea.<br />An 18-year-old soldier and a five-year-old kindergartner contracted the virus in early April after coming in contact with materials that had traveled by wind or carried by balloons in the border area, state media said. The conclusions were from an investigation carried out by North Korean medical experts. The two people had contracted the virus in the southeastern province of Kangwon, which shares a border with South Korea."
