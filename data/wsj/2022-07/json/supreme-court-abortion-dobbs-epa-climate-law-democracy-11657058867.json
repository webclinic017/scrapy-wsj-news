    "body": "One could say that the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization had little to do with abortion. Likewise, the decision in West Virginia v. EPA arguably had little to do with climate change (“Restoring a Constitutional Climate,” Review & Outlook, July 1). Beyond the headlines, both cases involve a fundamental issue of the utmost importance in a democratic society: Who decides?<br />While the effect of Dobbs, which overturned Roe v. Wade, may well be to reduce the availability of abortion services, the outcome is that the searingly divisive social issue should be determined by legislative bodies rather than by unelected judges. Similarly, while many accuse the justices in West Virginia of closing their eyes to climate change, the court actually decided that unless Congress expressly delegates to administrative agencies the power to adopt policies that would work major economic or social changes, that power must remain with Congress itself."
