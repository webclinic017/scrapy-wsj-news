    "body": "Elon Musk’s decision Friday to call off his purchase of  Twitter  is a loss for the social-media site as well as for political free speech. The only winners will be progressives who support the site’s censorship of views that don’t conform to theirs on politics, climate and many other subjects.<br />Critics say Mr. Musk was never serious about buying Twitter, but he sure went a long way to show he was. He now faces a $1 billion breakup fee, as well as extensive litigation with the company. Mr. Musk offered $54.20 a share, but the stock had fallen to $36.81 before Friday’s announcement. It fell to $35.04 in after-hours trading."
