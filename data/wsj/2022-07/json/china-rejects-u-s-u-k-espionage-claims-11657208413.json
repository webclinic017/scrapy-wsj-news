    "body": "China’s government dismissed a joint U.S.-U.K. warning to businesses that Beijing seeks to steal their corporate secrets, alleging instead that Washington represents the biggest threat to world peace.<br />Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Thursday that the U.S.-U.K. statements have no factual basis and expose an “entrenched Cold War zero-sum mentality and ideological prejudice.” He called the U.S. the most warlike nation in history and “the biggest threat to world peace and development,” while saying the U.K. spy services are trying to “project their own disgraceful acts onto China through these false, sensational reports” to stoke antagonism and confrontation."
