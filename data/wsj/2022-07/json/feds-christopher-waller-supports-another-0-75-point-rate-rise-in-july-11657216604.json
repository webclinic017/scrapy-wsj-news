    "body": "A top Federal Reserve official said he would support raising the benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage point at the central bank’s July 26-27 meeting as part of an effort to raise rates quickly to levels designed to slow the economy in order to combat high inflation.<br />“Inflation is just too high and doesn’t seem to be coming down,” said Fed governor Christopher Waller during a webinar on Thursday. “We need to move to a much more restrictive setting in terms of interest rates and policy, and we need to do that as quickly as possible.”"
