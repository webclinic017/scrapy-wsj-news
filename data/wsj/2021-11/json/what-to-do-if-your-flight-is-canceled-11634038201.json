    "body": "Few parts of the traveling experience are as unnerving as having a flight canceled.<br />Thousands of  American Airlines Group Inc.  customers had plans upended over the weekend after more than 1,900 flights were canceled. More than 300 additional flights were cut Monday, according to FlightAware, a flight-tracking website. The disruptions were sparked by wind gusts late last week that slowed the airline’s arrival times at its Dallas-Fort Worth hub, prompting staffing shortfalls."
