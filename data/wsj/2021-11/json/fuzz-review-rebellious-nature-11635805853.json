    "body": "For the past three years, a gray squirrel has set out to ruin my life, chewing leaves off my beloved exotic hibiscus and geraniums. What squirrel eats leaves? This one. In a steadily escalating campaign, she has checkmated every move I’ve made. She’s climbed a high deck, vaulted into pots on pedestals and hurled herself into baskets hung five feet above ground. Two live traps ignored. My dog, who is no slouch, has done his best. The squirrel watches and waits until my dog is indoors and I have driven off. Each time I come home, there’s another sad pile of bits where once there were blossoms. Still, Mary Roach’s “Fuzz: When Nature Breaks the Law” makes me feel grateful that my nemesis is only a rodent, and that I live in Ohio, not Colorado or India. My refrigerator will not be emptied by a bear; I will not be throttled by a leopard while taking out the compost.<br />Ms. Roach’s books have tackled human pursuits such as sex, digestion, death, war, space travel and even the afterlife, all with a “prove it to me!” attitude that is at turns exhilarating and astonishing. She wonders about the particulars many would prefer to leave a mystery, with a curiosity that is anything but childlike. With “Fuzz,” she focuses on those instances when nature, for a shocking change, wins."
