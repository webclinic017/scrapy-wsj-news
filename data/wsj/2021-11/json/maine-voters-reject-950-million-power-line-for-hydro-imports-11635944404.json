    "body": "Maine residents voted to reject a $950 million power transmission line under construction there to import Canadian hydropower, raising a hurdle for a long-pursued method of adding clean energy in New England.<br />The effect the vote will have on the 145-mile line wasn’t immediately clear.  Avangrid Inc.,  the parent company of the line builder Central Maine Power, indicated it plans a legal challenge. Electricity customers in Massachusetts are paying for the line, and it is a key part of that state’s plan to curb emissions."
