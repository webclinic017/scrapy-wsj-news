    "body": "With respect to “Help Really Wanted: Firms Ease Hiring” (Page One, Nov. 8) and “How Much M.B.A. Debt Should Students Take On?” (Personal Journal, Nov. 8): Is no one connecting the dots? This is the best time in decades for employers to pitch tuition assistance as their secret weapon in the recruitment process and to benefit from improved employee retention.<br />Ambitious employees, including candidates for employment, should negotiate for the flexibility to study part-time while working as many hours as necessary to be eligible for tuition assistance. Anyone planning to “take a career break” and accumulate huge debt getting an M.B.A. is exercising such poor business judgment that university admissions officers should reject the application."
