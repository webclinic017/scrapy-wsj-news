    "body": "It is a small irony that, even as negotiators were returning home from the Glasgow climate summit, data released Monday showed a small bump in China’s industrial growth—largely due to mining and power sector activity.<br />The good news, from a growth perspective at least, is that power curbs probably no longer present much of a threat to Chinese manufacturing writ large. The bad news is that domestic demand still looks very weak. Growth will probably decelerate further for the remainder of 2021 and into early 2022."
