Andrew Cuomo, respond to allegations of sexual misconduct.<br />In a statement released Tuesday, CNN said that the records “raise serious questions” about Chris Cuomo’s conduct. “These documents point to a greater level of involvement in his brother’s efforts than we previously knew,” a CNN spokesman said. “As a result, we have suspended Chris indefinitely, pending further evaluation.”"
