    "body": "Markets climb a wall of worry, and the renomination of Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chairman takes away one important uncertainty.<br />It was possible that President Joe Biden would pick Lael Brainard, who was nominated as Mr. Powellâ€™s deputy instead, and her approval process might have hit trouble in the Senate. By leaving Chairman Powell in charge that worry was removed, meaning policy stays on its previous, exceptionally easy, course."
