    "body": "Most of the time, spam filters work very well, shielding us from scamsters, hackers, old girlfriends or boyfriends and con artists masquerading as relatives being held at gunpoint in Syria. But all too often, legitimate emails go to the spam folder, and we miss important communications. Sometimes, the results are disastrous.<br />Just one example: In recent years, a great deal of criticism has been leveled at the Swedish Academy for its baffling awards of the Nobel Prize for Literature to writers no one has ever heard of. It turns out this is because the emails offering the Nobel keep going to the authors’ spam folders. Because the winners never reply, the prize goes to the next person on the list. But sometimes that person doesn’t get the email either. It might take 19 writers before one does."
