    "body": "Airbus SE ’s  aircraft deliveries dipped again in October as hiccups in its supply chain disrupted the manufacturer’s ambitions to rapidly return to pre-pandemic production levels.<br />The European plane maker said Friday it had delivered 36 commercial aircraft last month, down from 40 in both September and August, and the lowest monthly tally since February. That leaves it needing to hand over another 140 aircraft in the final two months of the year to meet its full-year target of 600 deliveries."
