    "body": "Adam Aron, the chief executive of  AMC  Entertainment Holdings Inc., on Tuesday filed to sell about $53 million worth of his shares in the company.<br />AMC, the world’s largest cinema chain with nearly 1,000 theaters worldwide, has become known for an enthusiastic base of retail investors who often coalesce on social media around their supposed commitment to hold on to shares and never sell them. Mr. Aron has leaned into AMC’s status as a meme stock and regularly engages with his online fan base."
