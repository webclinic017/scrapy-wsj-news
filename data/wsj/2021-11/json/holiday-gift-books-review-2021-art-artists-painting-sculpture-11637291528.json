    "body": "“David Smith” (1906-1965), the poet Frank O’Hara wrote, “was considered by many to be the finest sculptor North America has produced.” The critic Clement Greenberg asserted that Smith was “the best sculptor of his generation,” an artist whose works “could stand in Donatello’s company.” Now, with the arrival of the definitive three-volume “David Smith Sculpture: A Catalogue Raisonné, 1932-1965,” readers can grasp the astonishing breadth of Smith’s inimitable achievement—a wellspring for sculptors and art lovers alike.<br />Edited by Christopher Lyon, with essays by Mr. Lyon, Marc-Christian Roussel, Michael Brenson and Sarah Hamill (and impassioned forewords by Smith’s daughters, Rebecca and Candida Smith), this sumptuous box set boasts nearly 1,850 illustrations (including Smith’s paintings, drawings and his photographs of his sculptures). It handily replaces Rosalind Krauss’s 1977 catalogue raisonné."
