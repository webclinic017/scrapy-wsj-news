    "body": "The reliability of memory is expected to be a big part of the coming criminal trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, which is poised to hinge on testimony of women who say the British socialite helped financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse them decades ago.<br />Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers have said that they plan to cast doubt on the accusers’ accounts, in part by having a memory expert who has testified in many high-profile criminal cases take the stand to explain how people can develop false memories of past events."
