    "body": "Certain movies inspire committed fans to “cosplay”—or dress up like the characters. At any opening night Marvel screening, self-styled Thors, Black Widows and Captain Americas fill the seats. At Comic-Con conventions, attendees navigate the booths dressed as Stormtroopers and Captain Kirk of “Star Trek.” Most films that drive fans to cosplay are sci-fi- or superhero-focused. “House of Gucci” is not such a movie.<br />Opening this week, the nearly three-hour-film—directed by Ridley Scott and based on a 2000 book of the same name by journalist Sara Gay Forden—traces the true story of the decadent rise and tabloidy downfall of the Guccis, Italy’s first family of fashion. Though the rambling movie hasn’t been received warmly by many critics, it unsurprisingly features some standout outfits. Its costume designer, Janty Yates, who has long collaborated with Mr. Scott, won an Oscar for her work on his 2000 movie, “Gladiator.” Despite the at-times-unflattering story, Gucci (now owned by the Kering conglomerate, not the family) supported the movie, granting Ms. Yates access to its archive and letting the production shoot at one of its Milan boutiques."
