    "body": "We’re in a funny place with the Covid pandemic. It feels like it’s ending. Its ability to govern our lives is, certainly. Lockdowns and shutdowns ran out of steam; people have returned to life or are returning. At the same time we know we’re not at the end. We read the headlines—infections flare here, hospitals suddenly overwhelmed there. Covid isn’t leaving, it’s sticking around. The subject of mandates is an ever-changing blur; no one knows exactly what’s officially allowed, and where.<br />Great books will be filled with all we learned and how the pandemic changed us and our society. We’ll grapple with it for decades."
