    "body": "Striking workers at  Deere  & Co. are scheduled to vote Wednesday on a third contract offer from the company that boosts incentive pay for increasing factory output.<br />The farm- and construction-equipment makerâ€™s latest offer to more than 10,000 members of the United Auto Workers union would raise the base productivity pay about 4%, based on a summary of the offer provided to workers. The general wage increases, bonuses and improvements in pension funding in the offer are unchanged from a prior proposal that workers rejected earlier this month, workers said."
