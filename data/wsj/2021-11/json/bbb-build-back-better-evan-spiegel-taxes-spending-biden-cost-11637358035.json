    "body": "“America Will Be Number One—in Taxes” (Review & Outlook, Nov. 16) makes valid points about the statutory top income-tax rate on multimillionaires, but it gives the wrong impression about U.S. taxes in two regards.<br />First, Congress raised the top marginal income-tax rate to above 90% in an effort to finance the military efforts in World War II in an existential battle for our future, not in a “bout of envy politics.” Of course, the average effective rate that people paid at that time was significantly lower."
