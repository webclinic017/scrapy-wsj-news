    "body": "What is the master theme of the 21st century? I’d say it is the vanishing of borders—geographic, political, social, racial, sexual, moral. The age’s obliteration of boundaries and norms has released powerful energies that are sometimes creative, sometimes destructive, and often merely bizarre.<br />I think of Robert Frost’s poem “Mending Wall,” a sly parable that amounts, in effect, to a dialogue between its first line (“Something there is that doesn’t love a wall”) and its parting maxim (“Good fences make good neighbors”). Two principles are in conflict: 1) Walls naturally tumble, let them go; 2) Unless walls are kept in good repair, social order is apt to disintegrate. Entropy is freedom’s evil twin."
