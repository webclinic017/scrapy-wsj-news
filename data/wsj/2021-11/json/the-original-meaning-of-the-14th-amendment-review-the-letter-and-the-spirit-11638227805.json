    "body": "Measured against the sweep of Anglo-American legal history, judicial review—the power of unelected judges to invalidate, as contrary to higher law, an act of the legislature—was a radical development. In 1610 the formidable Edward Coke, then Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, suggested in Dr. Bonham’s Case that an act of Parliament contrary to the common law was “void”; but for nearly two centuries that idea went nowhere.<br />Only the innovation of a written constitution—which Hayek called the “American Contribution” to limited government—brought the matter to a head, in the 1803 case of Marbury v. Madison. There, a minor provision of the 1789 Judiciary Act conflicted with Article III of the Constitution; the Supreme Court could not give effect to both; and thus Chief Justice John Marshall deduced a principle “essential to all written constitutions, that a law repugnant to the constitution is void.” Hence the very premise of judicial review is a conflict between a legislative (or executive) act and the written Constitution."
