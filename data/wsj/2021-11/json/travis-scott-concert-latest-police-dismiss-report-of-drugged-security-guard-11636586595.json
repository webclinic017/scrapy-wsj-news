    "body": "Reports that a security guard was injected with a drug during a Travis Scott concert that turned deadly are false, Houston Police Chief Troy Finner said Wednesday.<br />Police were investigating whether anyone had been maliciously injected with drugs at the show, Mr. Finner said last Saturday, after a report that a security guard had been pricked in the neck. The police chief said at a news conference Wednesday that authorities talked with the guard in question and found the report was inaccurate. The man told officials he’d been struck in the head but wasn’t injected with drugs, Mr. Finner said."
