    "body": "Two blue-chip financial companies are looking to add more square footage at Hudson Yards, the latest sign that high-end office space is still in demand as companies try to lure back remote workers and retain talent.<br />Private-equity firm KKR & Co., which owns the top 10 office floors of the development’s flagship office tower, is looking to expand its footprint, according to people familiar with the matter. Financial-services company Wells Fargo & Co., which already occupies 500,000 square feet in the same building, has also expressed interest in more space, these people said."
