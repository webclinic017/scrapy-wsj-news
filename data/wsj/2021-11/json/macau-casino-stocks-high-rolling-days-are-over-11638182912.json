    "body": "Macau’s losing streak isn’t over yet. High-rollers from China and their financiers—previously a big revenue source for casinos—seem likely to focus on keeping their own heads from rolling rather than resuming their profligate ways next year.<br />Shares of casino operators in the semiautonomous Chinese city plunged Monday after the government said that the chairman of the city’s biggest junket operator was being held for questioning. Wynn Macau fell 8% while MGM China dropped 10%."
