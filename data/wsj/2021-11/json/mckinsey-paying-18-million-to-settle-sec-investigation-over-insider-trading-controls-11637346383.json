    "body": "WASHINGTON—McKinsey & Co. has agreed to pay $18 million to settle allegations that it didn’t adequately guard against the risk of insider trading involving investments in companies for which the firm was also a consultant.<br />McKinsey partners had access to material nonpublic information at companies such as  Alpha Natural Resources Inc.  and SunEdison Inc. through the bankruptcy work the consulting firm did for those companies, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Meanwhile, another unit of McKinsey, MIO Partners Inc., which managed the partners’ retirement funds, invested in outside hedge funds that were investors in those companies, the SEC said."
