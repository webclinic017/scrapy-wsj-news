    "body": "We are a nation of workaholics. Americans work, on average, more hours than our counterparts in any peer nation, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The Covid-19 crisis only deepened our obsession with productivity. In 2020, employee engagement rates hit record highs as workers doubled down on their jobs to fend off layoffs, financial uncertainty and social isolation.<br />Then many of us hit a wall. A March 2021 survey by the job-aggregator site Indeed found more than half of respondents said they felt burned out. A month later, four million people quit. And while millions more remain unemployed after losing their jobs due to Covid, employers are reporting an acute labor shortage: In September the Great Resignation continued with more than 4.4 million workers, or 3% of the workforce, leaving their jobs. Weâ€™re at an inflection point as we re-evaluate how, where and when we want to work. Maybe this is a chance to discover a cure for our workaholism and achieve that ever-elusive work-life balance."
