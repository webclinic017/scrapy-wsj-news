    "body": "When the flagship of the progressive flotilla calls for a retreat, you know something big has happened. In a remarkable editorial last week, the  New York Times  called for “an honest conversation in the Democratic Party about how to return to the moderate policies and values that fueled the blue-wave victories in 2018 and won Joe Biden the presidency in 2020.”<br />The Times editorial board cited economic issues such as inflation and spending and cultural issues such as border security and crime. “The concerns of more centrist Americans about a rush to spend taxpayer money, a rush to grow the government, should not be dismissed,” the editors rightly declared. A recent Gallup survey found that whereas a year ago Americans wanted government to do more, today they prefer government to do less. The share of independents who favor a more active government has dropped nearly 20 points."
