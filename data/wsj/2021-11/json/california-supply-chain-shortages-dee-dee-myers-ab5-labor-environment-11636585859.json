    "body": "In her op-ed about global supply-chain congestion, Allysia Finley speciously blames California’s efforts to protect workers and the environment (“California Is the Supply Chain’s Weakest Link,” op-ed, Nov. 5). She focuses on the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which, she writes, “handle only about 40% of containers entering the U.S.” Only 40%? Together, the Southern California ports are by far the largest in North America.<br />Ms. Finley alleges that California policies are the culprit—in particular, AB5, a state law that extends worker protections to independent contractors. She fails to note that AB5 doesn’t currently apply to the state’s trucking sector or that there is a national shortage of 80,000 truck drivers a decade in the making."
