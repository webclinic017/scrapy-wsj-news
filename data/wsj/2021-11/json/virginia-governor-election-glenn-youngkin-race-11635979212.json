    "body": "One salutary result from Glenn Youngkin’s victory in Virginia Tuesday is the failure of Democratic racial demagoguery. Throughout the campaign Democrats and their media allies assailed Mr. Youngkin and his supporters as closet white supremacists. MSNBC’s Joy Reid said the issue of education and critical race theory is “code for white parents don’t like the idea of teaching about race.”<br />On PBS the Washington Post’s Jonathan Capehart said that if Mr. Youngkin won it would be because Republicans decided that “tap-dancing with white supremacy is their way back into power.” Terry McAuliffe was especially nasty as he closed his campaign this weekend, saying of his rival: “He’s run a racist campaign from start to finish.”"
