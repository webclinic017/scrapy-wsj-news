    "body": "Three is better than one. Splitting into three companies seems to be the trendy thing to do for once-mighty industrial icons.<br />Japanese electronics maker  Toshiba  said Friday it would break itself up into three companies. That follows a similar announcement from General Electric on Tuesday. The two century-old companies used to be manufacturing pioneers in their countries with businesses spanning disparate sectors.

A foreign investor revolt led to the ouster of the company’s chairman in June."
