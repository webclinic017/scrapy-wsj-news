    "body": "A great many detective series are less about the crime than the chemistry— how does the police team fit together? How does the investigative genius deal with his demons? How does the cynical veteran deal with the overly woke rookie? How much sexual history already exists between the principals? Whether or not the formula works, this kind of show is always cobbled together out of pre-existing parts.<br />So is the “victim” in “Ragdoll,” a U.S.-U.K. production that involves a particularly gruesome bit of business: A body has been discovered, suspended on wires and constructed from the bodies of six different corpses—a Black leg, a Caucasian torso, etc. The face is familiar to police detective Nathan Rose (Henry Lloyd-Hughes): Rose punched it repeatedly in a London courtroom after its owner, the accused “Cremation Killer,” was set free due to police misconduct—Rose’s misconduct. This results in the veteran detective being sent to a psychiatric hospital. There, it turns out later, events are set in motion that will lead to what will be dubbed the “Ragdoll” murders, Rose’s collateral involvement being one of the series’ essential elements."
