    "body": "Regarding Kimberley Strassel’s “Durham and the Clinton Dossier” (Potomac Watch, Nov. 5): The Jan. 6 committee in the House is hell-bent on holding former President Trump accountable for the “insurrection” at the Capitol. It is even willing to push the envelope on standards of privacy for White House communications to connect Mr. Trump to the uprising.<br />But what was more threatening to U.S. democracy: years of distraction, disruption and dysfunction in Washington based on phony charges of collusion with Russia or the Jan. 6 riot? Were pro-Trump revolutionaries on the verge of overthrowing the U.S. government on Jan. 6? The riot was disturbing, but it was over in a matter of hours. By contrast, a stealth insurrection against a sitting U.S. president based on knowingly false charges of collusion with a foreign enemy did lasting damage to faith and confidence in government."
