    "body": "Ford ’s  collaboration with  GlobalFoundries  is likely the first of many between the semiconductor industry and car companies intent on tailing  Tesla .  Just don’t expect Detroit to actually make microchips.<br />Ford and GlobalFoundries on Thursday announced an early-stage agreement to work together to address two distinct problems facing car manufacturers. Most visibly, lack of semiconductor supplies has led to a sharp decline in global vehicle production and inventories on dealer lots. Longer term, the growth of electric vehicles and the software required to operate them will take demand for automotive chips into a new league."
