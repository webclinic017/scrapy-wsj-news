    "body": "Challenges are piling up for South Korea’s once highflying shares.<br />Seoul has been one of the world’s best-performing big stock markets, with its value topping $1.6 trillion in August, according to data from the World Federation of Exchanges.

A day-trading boom among individual investors is also fizzling out, reducing a key source of support."
