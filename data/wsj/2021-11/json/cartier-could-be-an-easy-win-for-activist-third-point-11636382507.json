This may be the only point that an activist investor need make to the owner of French jeweler Cartier.<br />Shares in Geneva-based Compagnie Financière Richemont rose 4% in morning trading Monday following a weekend report in fashion journal Miss Tweed that Daniel Loeb’s Third Point hedge fund has built a stake.
