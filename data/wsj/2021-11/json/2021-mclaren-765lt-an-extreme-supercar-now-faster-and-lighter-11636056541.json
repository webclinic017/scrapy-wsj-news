    "body": "DUE TO THE periodic arrival of fantasy automobiles at my house, I am legend with the kids in the neighborhood. But even these veteran trainspotters were unprepared for the arrival of the coral-orange metallic McLaren 765LT Coupe. I watched their impressionable minds and mercenary hearts go kablooey at the sight. I felt like I was contributing to the delinquency of minors.<br />The technical details are fascinating, but take a moment to appreciate the computationally derived beauty of the thing. With the 765LT (“Longtail”), McLaren’s usual biomimetic muscularity is even more explicit, its tendons and sinews even tauter, more exposed. I felt like handing it a robe."
