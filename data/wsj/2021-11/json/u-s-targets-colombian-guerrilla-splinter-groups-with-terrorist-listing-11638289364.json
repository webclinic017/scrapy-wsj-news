    "body": "The Biden administration added two new Colombian drug-trafficking gangs to its list of foreign terrorist organizations, reflecting the U.S.’s determination to support a peace agreement in Colombia threatened by the groups’ mayhem.<br />The U.S. on Tuesday declared that the New Marquetalia group and the FARC-EP would join a blacklist of groups that include al Qaeda, Hamas and Boko Haram. At the same time, the Biden administration said it is removing the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, because the decades-old guerrilla group “formally dissolved and disarmed” upon signing a peace agreement with Colombia’s government in 2016. The Wall Street Journal reported on the removal last week."
