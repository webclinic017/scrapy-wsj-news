    "body": "KENOSHA, Wis.â€”After three and a half days of deliberations, a jury here acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager charged with killing two people during unrest last year, ending a highly watched case that turned on whether the teen had acted in self-defense.<br />Mr. Rittenhouse, now 18 years old, faced charges of intentional, reckless and attempted homicide, and reckless endangerment. The case revolved around his actions the night of Aug. 25, 2020, as he patrolled the city with an AR-15-style rifle and a small medical kit amid unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake. His attorneys argued he acted in self-defense and entered a not guilty plea. He has been free on $2 million in bail, mostly raised by supporters online."
