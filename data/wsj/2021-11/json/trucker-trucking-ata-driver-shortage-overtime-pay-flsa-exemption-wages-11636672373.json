    "body": "The American Trucking Associations (ATA) members who cry about a driver “shortage” are the same ones who asked for the motor-carrier exemption to overtime pay in the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), citing the difficulty in paying drivers for inclement weather, traffic or accident delays, truck breakdowns, delays at shippers and consignees, etc. (“Shortage of Truck Drivers Worsens Supply-Chain Mess,” Page One, Nov. 4) That difficulty no longer holds true with the full implementation in December 2019 of electronic logging devices that track the vehicle and hours of service by the second.<br />Driver retention has become a bigger problem in the past several years. U.S. hours-of-service rules limit over-the-road long-haul truckers to driving 70 hours in eight days. Beyond those hours, the waiting at loading docks, maintenance, fuel-ups and myriad other job-related activities are performed off the clock to preserve their precious hours of service."
