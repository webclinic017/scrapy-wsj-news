    "body": "Survey results of Virginia voters indicate that Republican businessman Glenn Youngkin beat former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe by peeling away key voter groups that a year ago favored President Biden.<br />The economy and jobs were at the top of mind in an electorate where a slight majority disapprove of the president and an even larger group feel the country is headed in the wrong direction. The political newcomer also appeared to strike the right tone by accepting former President Donald Trumpâ€™s endorsement but not campaigning alongside him. Mr. Trump lost the state by 10 percentage points last year."
