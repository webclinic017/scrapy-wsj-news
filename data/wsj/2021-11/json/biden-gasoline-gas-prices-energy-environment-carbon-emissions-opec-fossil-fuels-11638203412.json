    "body": "I don’t understand why President Biden has a problem with higher gasoline prices (“Strategic Political Oil Reserve,” Review & Outlook, Nov. 24). Is it not the environmental movement’s objective to make gasoline prices punitively expensive to encourage Americans to use more fuel-efficient or electric vehicles, so that our nation reduces greenhouse-gas emissions to save the planet from warming?<br />A reader might conclude there is a serious dissonance between this administration’s energy and environmental policies. On the one hand, it makes efforts to cancel oil pipelines and stop energy exploration on federal lands. On the other, Mr. Biden begs OPEC nations to increase oil production to bring down prices by meeting the demand we are unwilling to supply ourselves."
