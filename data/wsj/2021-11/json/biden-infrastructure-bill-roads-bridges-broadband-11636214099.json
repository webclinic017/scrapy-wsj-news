    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden campaigned on rebuilding long-neglected roads, bridges and highways as he sought the presidency last year, pointing to his infrastructure proposal as a way to work with Republicans and deliver on the needs of Americans.<br />Mr. Biden is now on the cusp of signing the roughly $1 trillion legislation into law, giving him a much-needed bipartisan victory as he grapples with sluggish approval ratings and the aftermath of Republicans’ triumph in Virginia’s off-year elections. Going forward, the legislation offers the president a ready-made platform to promote construction jobs, ribbon-cuttings and union-friendly groundbreakings around the nation ahead of next year’s congressional elections."
