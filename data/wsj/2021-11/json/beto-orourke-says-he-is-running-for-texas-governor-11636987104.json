    "body": "AUSTIN, Texas—Beto O’Rourke, the former Democratic U.S. presidential candidate, said he is running for governor of Texas, setting up a face-off next year in the nation’s second-largest state against a historically popular Republican governor many of whose policies have moved right over the course of his tenure.<br />“We’ve got to get past the divisiveness and meanness and smallness of the politics that defines this moment in Texas…and get back to doing the big and important work that most of us agree on,” Mr. O’Rourke said in an interview Monday."
