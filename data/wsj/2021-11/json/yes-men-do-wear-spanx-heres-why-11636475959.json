    "body": "For his May 1 wedding, Josh Schwartz slipped a Spanx T-shirt under his suit and, frankly, he doesn’t see how it differs from the compression gear that countless guys wear to the gym to promote the flow of blood and oxygen to muscles. “It just has a different label on it,” he said. The New York fashion designer, 31, bought the white crew neck before the big day because his suit was a bit snug and he had no time to shed any pounds.

Still, the nomenclature remains fraught. Although Spanx refers to its men’s products as “shapewear,” some guys consider that a loaded term due to its associations with women’s lingerie, said Tommy Patterson, the founder of underwear brand Tommy John. “Compression wear,” with its athletic connotations, more comfortably conforms to societal norms. Consequently, lots of underwear brands have opted for that tag."
