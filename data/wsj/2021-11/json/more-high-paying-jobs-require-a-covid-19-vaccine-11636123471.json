    "body": "People looking for work in a tight job market are increasingly finding employers requiring vaccination against Covid-19, with a small but growing percentage flagging those rules to prospective hires from the outset.<br />Nearly 5% of U.S. and Canadian postings for jobs paying $80,000 a year or more now mention vaccine mandates, double the rate from the previous month, according to research released Wednesday by the Ladders, a job-search site for positions paying north of $100,000 annually. The findings are based on an analysis of millions of high-paying jobs posted between June 2019 and October 2021."
