    "body": "WASHINGTON—Supreme Court justices weighed a condemned inmate’s argument that federal law protecting religious exercise entitles him to his pastor’s touch while Texas puts him to death, an act the state contends risks disruption while it carries out the execution.<br />John H. Ramirez was convicted in 2008 of fatally stabbing Pablo Castro, a convenience-store clerk in Corpus Christi, Texas, during a 2004 robbery in which he got away with $1.25. His minister since 2016, Dana Moore of Second Baptist Church in Corpus Christi, cited biblical passages to assert that “laying on of my hands,” along with vocalizing prayers, was essential in ministering to Mr. Ramirez during his final moments."
