    "body": "A Pentagon review of a U.S. drone strike in Kabul that killed 10 civilians in August concluded that American forces made a series of mistakes and misinterpretations—including failing to spot children nearby minutes before the strike—but said no international laws of war were violated.<br />The general in charge of the investigation said the Aug. 29 strike was an understandable mistake given the “unique” circumstances and conditions involved. The U.S. had initially said it targeted and struck a suspected terrorist bomber, before later saying it killed an aide worker and a group of civilians including children."
