    "body": "The U.S. is at the forefront of the race to vaccinate young children. Many governments elsewhere are treading more cautiously.<br />In Mexico, the president says he won’t be held hostage by vaccine makers and there are no plans to inoculate under-18s except those at risk. In many parts of Africa, rollouts are going so slowly that vaccinating children is a distant ambition. Some governments are waiting to see how the campaign in the U.S. goes before moving ahead."
