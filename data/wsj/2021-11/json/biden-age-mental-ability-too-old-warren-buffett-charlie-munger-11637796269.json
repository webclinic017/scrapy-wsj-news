    "body": "In “As Biden Turns 79, a Panic Over Harris” (Review & Outlook, Nov. 20), the editorial board cites a poll of voters that finds 58% think President Biden is “too old to be President.” I think the pollster is asking the wrong question. It should be: “Is Joe Biden physically and mentally fit to be president?”<br />The president’s age is mostly irrelevant. There are many examples I could use, but here are two: Charlie Munger is 97. His partner, Warren Buffett, is 91. Holders of shares of  Berkshire Hathaway  have been very pleased with the investment decisions these two have made during the 18 years, for Mr. Munger, and 12, for Mr. Buffett, since they turned 79."
