    "body": "In “Topsy-Turvy,” Mike Leigh’s 1999 masterpiece about Gilbert & Sullivan, actress Wendy Nottingham delivers the old line: “The more I see of men, the more I admire dogs.” Dogs also come off relatively well in “The Great,” which returns to Hulu on Friday, visiting a much earlier historical period, with far less music, far more violence and much more sex. But the male behavior is mangy enough that an empire hangs in the balance.<br />What hangs over the second-season debut of the series—an “occasionally true story” about Catherine the Great (Elle Fanning)—is whether the show could maintain its often delicious balance of the elegant and the vulgar, the decorous and the disgusting, the carnal and the carnivorous. Based on the Australian writer Tony McNamara’s play and scripted largely by him, the inaugural “Great” maintained an edge despite hinging largely on one joke, or maybe one surprise: that the lushly costumed people of 18th-century St. Petersburg—inhabiting the Winter Palace as well as a tumultuous era in feudal history—might talk like they were in a David Mamet play and act like rutting beasts. It was like “Bridgerton” on the Volga."
