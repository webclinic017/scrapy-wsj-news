    "body": "Wall Street shouldn’t be thrilled about this week’s agreement among Democrats on a plan to lower the cost of prescription drugs. But it removes the threat of something that would be far more damaging to pharmaceutical investors.<br />The agreement, which is backed by the White House, would empower Medicare to negotiate the price of expensive drugs whose market exclusivity granted by regulators has expired. This puts long-term sales of blockbuster drugs like the blood thinner Eliquis or the cancer drug Keytruda at risk."
