    "body": "Last fall, we profiled two restaurants—high-end Goosefeather in New York state, and breakfast locale Hangar B, in Cape Cod in Massachusetts—to get an inside look at how these businesses were coping during the pandemic.<br />Goosefeather, part of the luxury hotel and event space Tarrytown House Estate, opened in September 2019. Celebrity chef-owner Dale Talde, who rose to fame on the show “Top Chef,” attracted crowds from the outset with his Hong Kong-inspired fare, signature cocktails and eclectic décor. But when Covid hit just a few months after opening, Mr. Talde scrambled to keep the restaurant running. He quickly switched to takeout and delivery only, sometimes delivering meals himself when staff ran low."
