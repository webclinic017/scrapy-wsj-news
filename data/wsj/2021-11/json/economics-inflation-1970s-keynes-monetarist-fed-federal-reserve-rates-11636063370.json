    "body": "Mickey Levy is correct that inflation is a bigger problem than the Federal Reserve realizes (“Fed Complacency Feeds Inflation,” op-ed, Nov. 1). But subduing inflation is likely to be more difficult than he and others suggest.<br />There is still uncertainty about what caused and ended the Great Inflation of the 1970s and early ’80s. Monetarists were disheartened to find the growth rates of the monetary aggregates changed little over the period. The federal-funds rate peaked above 20% in the early 1980s, causing many economists to conclude that high interest rates must have quelled the inflation. The long-held Keynesian view that interest rates were unimportant for spending decisions vanished. Monetary policy became about interest rates; money was irrelevant. The Greenspan Fed used the federal-funds rate as the Fed’s policy instrument. When a rate of zero proved ineffective, the Bernanke Fed introduced several new policies to try to reduce long-term interest rates."
