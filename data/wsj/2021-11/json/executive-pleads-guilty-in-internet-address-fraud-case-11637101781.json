    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”A technology executive pleaded guilty to federal wire-fraud charges on Tuesday, closing an obscure but potentially influential case that could shape future criminal prosecutions involving companies that provide bedrock internet services to customers.<br />Amir Golestan entered a plea on behalf of himself and his company, Micfo, at the end of the second day of a trial in federal court in Charleston, S.C., according to court records. He was accused of using fraudulent means to obtain thousands of internet protocol, or IP, addresses from the American Registry for Internet Numbers, a small Virginia-based nonprofit that allocates the addresses that computers use to communicate online."
