    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 pro-Trump riot issued another round of subpoenas Monday to people reportedly involved in planning or financing rallies that preceded the march and attack on the Capitol, including Infowars host Alex Jones and Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to former President Donald Trump.<br />Chairman Bennie G. Thompson (D., Miss.) said the committee needs to know who organized, planned, paid for and received funds related to Jan. 6 activities, as well as what communications organizers had with people in the White House and Congress. “We believe the witnesses we subpoenaed today have relevant information, and we expect them to cooperate fully with our effort to get answers for the American people about the violence” that day, Mr. Thompson said."
