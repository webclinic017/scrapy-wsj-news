    "body": "LOUISVILLE, Ky.—When General Electric Co. agreed to sell its appliance unit to a Chinese manufacturer in 2016, the future wasn’t clear for the business, its workers or the tens of millions of U.S. households owning  GE  appliances.<br />Nearly six years later, GE Appliances is growing, having increased its U.S. market share every year since 2017. Since being bought by Qingdao, China-based Haier Group, GE Appliances has invested about $1.5 billion in technology and new products, and added about 3,000 jobs for a total U.S. workforce of 15,000. In October, the company announced an additional $450 million investment and 1,000 new jobs at its main Appliance Park campus in Louisville that makes washers, dryers, dishwashers and refrigerators."
