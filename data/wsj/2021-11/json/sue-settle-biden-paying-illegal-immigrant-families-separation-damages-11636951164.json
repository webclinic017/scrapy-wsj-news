    "body": "Regarding Peter Wallison’s op-ed “Will Biden ‘Sue and Settle’ at the Border?” (Nov. 11): “Sue and settle” litigation initiated by the ACLU for families that were separated when they tried to enter the U.S. illegally should be countered by Justice Department lawyers in the Biden administration (as it probably would have been by the Trump administration) with a defense that any first-year law student would recognize from a class in torts: assumption of the risk.<br />Illustrative is a California law (Civil Code Section 3333.3, adopted by ballot initiative) that provides: “In any action for damages based on negligence, a person may not recover any damages if the plaintiff’s injuries were in any way proximately caused by the plaintiff’s commission of any felony.”"
