    "body": "HONG KONG—China Huarong Asset Management Co., the country’s biggest buyer of bad loans from banks, said it would receive a $6.5 billion capital injection from state-owned financial institutions, moving forward with a major step in a complicated restructuring.<br />The Beijing-based company, which is majority owned by China’s Finance Ministry, incurred a huge loss last year and is being bailed out after veering into areas far beyond its core business of managing distressed assets. The Chinese government’s action to rescue Huarong—which prevented the company from defaulting on billions of dollars in international debt—stands in contrast with its reluctance to bail out property giant  China Evergrande Group ,  whose U.S. dollar bonds have plunged to deeply distressed levels in recent months."
