    "body": "Ghislaine Maxwell is a British socialite accused of conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse underage girls. “Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set,” then Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said in a July 2020 indictment accusing Ms. Maxwell of conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse minors. “She pretended to be a woman they could trust.”Ms. Maxwell has pleaded not guilty. Her lawyers have argued she is a scapegoat for Epstein, who died in his jail cell in August 2019, about a month after his indictment on sex-trafficking charges. The medical examiner ruled his death a suicide.<br />Ms. Maxwell is the daughter of a former member of Parliament in the United Kingdom and billionaire publisher, Robert Maxwell. Her father died in 1991 after falling off his yacht, which was named the “Lady Ghislaine.” A few years later, the first public reports of Ms. Maxwell’s romantic relationship with Epstein surfaced in tabloids."
