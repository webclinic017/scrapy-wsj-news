    "body": "<br />‘Bruised,” the directorial debut of Oscar-winning actress Halle Berry, is both a sports movie and a redemption tale—which is redundant, because sports movies are always redemption tales. The heroes—winners turned losers turned winners—discover some eternal truth lying beyond the end zone, home plate or whatever they’re running toward. The stories often suggest, quite strongly, that victory isn’t everything."
