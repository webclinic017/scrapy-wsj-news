    "body": "German regulators Tuesday suspended certification proceedings for a controversial natural-gas pipeline from Russia, adding to concerns Europe will run low on fuel this winter.<br />Construction of Nord Stream 2 was completed in September, but gas has yet to flow through the pipeline. The conduit links Russia and Germany and is awaiting approval from German and European authorities. Washington opposes the pipeline, which circumvents U.S. allies including Ukraine and Poland and could deepen Europeâ€™s dependency on Russian gas. However, the U.S. waived sanctions on the project earlier this year, clearing a path for its completion."
