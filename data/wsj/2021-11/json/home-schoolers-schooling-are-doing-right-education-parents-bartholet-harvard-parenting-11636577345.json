    "body": "Elizabeth Bartholet, a Harvard Law School professor, sparked debate in May 2020 by calling for a presumptive ban on home schooling. Home-schooled children, Ms. Bartholet asserted, are less likely than their school-attending peers to receive a “meaningful education” and more likely to be subject to physical abuse or indoctrination by “extreme religious ideologues.”<br />Eighteen months later, the debate still rages. Parents opted to try home schooling in unprecedented numbers during the pandemic. While home-schoolers accounted for 5.4% of all school-age children during the 2019-20 school year, that figure had more than doubled to 11.1% by the start of 2020-21. Many of those students will eventually return to public or private schools, but it seems certain that a sharp increase in home schooling will be one lasting consequence of the pandemic."
