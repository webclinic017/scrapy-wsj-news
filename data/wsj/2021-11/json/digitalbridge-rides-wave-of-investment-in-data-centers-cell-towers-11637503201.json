    "body": "Marc Ganzi, chief executive officer of  DigitalBridge Group Inc.,  is a big fan of digital infrastructure—and these days he’s not alone.<br />In July 2019,  Colony Capital Inc.  bought Mr. Ganzi’s private-equity firm and unveiled a plan to shift from being a real-estate generalist to focusing on digital assets such as data centers, cell towers and fiber networks. It fell to Mr. Ganzi, who took over from Colony founder Thomas Barrack last year as the combined companies’ CEO, to make that vision a reality."
