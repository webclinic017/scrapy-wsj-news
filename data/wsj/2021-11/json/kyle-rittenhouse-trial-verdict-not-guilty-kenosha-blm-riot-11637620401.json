    "body": "The Rittenhouse verdict is no victory for conservatism, law and order or the Second Amendment (“Kyle Rittenhouse Is Not Guilty,” Review & Outlook, Nov. 20). Nor is it a loss for progressives, who have shamelessly made martyrs of a child molester, a domestic abuser and an armed communist revolutionary, all emboldened by the powers that be to attack a Wisconsin town. They met one guy holding a rifle, instead of the hundreds with badges who should have been there to stop them.<br />That charges were even filed demonstrates that fear of the mob prevails. The mob says “jump” and everyone scurries to ask “how high?” If video evidence of marauders pursuing and attacking Mr. Rittenhouse didn’t exist, or had the African-American assailant he shot at and missed been hit, Mr. Rittenhouse would probably now be in prison."
