But traumatic brain injuries, including concussions, aren’t a problem only for athletes who play contact sports. Each year at least 69 million people world-wide suffer a traumatic brain injury.<br />Considering how precious our brains are to our health and well-being, we should be monitoring them as conscientiously as we do our hearts or joints.
