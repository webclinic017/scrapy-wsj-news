Chief Executive David Solomon said mainland China and Hong Kong’s strict border controls are creating staffing challenges, as the region’s tight quarantine regime wears on foreign workers and businesses.<br />“Certainly, being restricted in terms of leaving or coming back, the family pressure, etc., that’s not a great dynamic for talent,” Mr. Solomon said Wednesday. “That’s certainly a headwind for global talent in that part of the world, right at this moment.”"
