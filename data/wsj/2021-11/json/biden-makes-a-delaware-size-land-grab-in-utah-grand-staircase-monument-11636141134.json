    "body": "President Clinton took a drastic step in 1996 that changed Utah forever. Using the Antiquities Act of 1906, he unilaterally designated 1.7 million acres—a landmass larger than the state of Delaware—as a national monument. Done against the wishes of local leaders, Mr. Clinton’s designation of the Grand Staircase National Monument had immediate negative effects, as it closed off the region to energy and resource development, including land that had previously produced funds for Utah’s schools.<br />In December 2016, weeks before leaving office, President Obama designated a second Delaware-size national monument in southern Utah: a 1.3 million-acre region encompassing the Bears Ears Buttes in San Juan County. While the area has countless sacred and special sites worthy of protection, the monument designation went too far. “By significantly restricting access to a large portion of public lands in Utah, the president weakens land management capabilities and fails to protect those the Antiquities Act intended to benefit,” said Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes at the time."
