    "body": "U.S. stock futures wavered, pointing to muted opening moves for indexes that stand at record highs.<br />Futures for the S&P 500 traded flat Tuesday, a day after the benchmark index closed at an all-time high for the eighth consecutive session—the longest streak of records since 1997. If the broad stocks gauge climbs for a ninth straight trading day it would mark the longest winning streak since 2004, according to  Deutsche Bank  strategist Jim Reid."
