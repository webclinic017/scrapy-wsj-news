    "body": "Every 30 seconds, someone somewhere in the world buys a bottle of Chanel No. 5, the French government declared in 2006, a claim that has often been repeated. Whether it’s still true, or if it ever was, is a company secret, as Chanel’s sales figures were private until 2017. What is certain is that “le monstre,” as Chanel No. 5 is known in the industry, has been a sensation from the moment it appeared in 1921. Coco Chanel created it with the expert “nose” Ernest Beaux as a complement to her radical new fashion. She wanted a fresh, abstract scent that, like her little black dresses, epitomized modern allure.<br />Yet as several books published to coincide with the perfume’s centennial affirm, Chanel No. 5’s enduring success owes as much to ambitious marketing as enticing scent. The history of this promotional juggernaut is laid bare in “Chanel No. 5: Story of a Perfume,” an oversized, lavishly illustrated two-volume boxed set by the French writer Pauline Dreyfus. It completely dwarfs “Chanel No. 5: The Perfume of a Century” (White Star, 64 pages, $16.95) by Italian journalist Chiara Pasqualetti Johnson, a slight, thin book that includes a small selection of some of the same photographs."
