    "body": "The Richard King Mellon Foundation announced a $100 million grant to fund a center for biomedical manufacturing, the latest piece in a plan to redevelop a stretch of riverfront outside Pittsburgh nearly half the size of the city’s downtown.<br />The 178-acre property known as Hazelwood Green is the site of a former LTV Steel mill that shut in the 1990s. The $100 million grant will fund a bio-manufacturing facility called the Pitt BioForge to be run by the University of Pittsburgh, with the aim of attracting companies that produce cell and gene therapies to treat cancer and other health conditions."
