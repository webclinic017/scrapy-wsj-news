    "body": "Americans are paying higher prices for groceries, gas and holiday gifts, yet many are living and spending as if it isn’t happening.<br />The U.S. consumer-price index hit a 31-year high in October, as the price paid for goods and services rose 6.2% from a year ago, according to the Labor Department.
