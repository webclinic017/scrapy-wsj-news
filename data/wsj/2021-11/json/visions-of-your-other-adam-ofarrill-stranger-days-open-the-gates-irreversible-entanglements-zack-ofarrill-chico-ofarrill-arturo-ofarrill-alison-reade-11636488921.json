    "body": "<br />Two recordings out this Friday—“Visions of Your Other” (Biophilia), by trumpeter and composer Adam O’Farrill and his quartet Stranger Days, and “Open the Gates” (International Anthem), by the quintet Irreversible Entanglements—are emblematic of the current trends in jazz. Mr. O’Farrill’s music is refined and discreet; it integrates aspects of art rock and contemporary classical music and boasts a cinematic influence. The Entanglements’ music is bold, uncompromising and flamboyant; it adds elements of spoken word and hip-hop. Both bands have emerged in the past seven years and are among the most engaging in jazz."
