    "body": "Home prices are soaring thanks to inflation and other government policies, so what to do? The Biden Administration’s answer is apparently to make homes more affordable for the paupers in Nantucket and Palo Alto by guaranteeing mortgages up to $1 million.<br />The Journal reported Tuesday that government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are expected to raise their conforming loan limits to about $650,000 from $548,250 and nearly $1 million in “high-cost” markets from $822,375. That’s to keep pace with the inflation in housing prices, which were up 23% in the second quarter year-over-year."
