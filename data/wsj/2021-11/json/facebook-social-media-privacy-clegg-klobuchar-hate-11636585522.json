    "body": "In “No More Blind Trust in Big Tech” by Sen. Amy Klobuchar and “Facebook Can’t Do It Alone” by Nick Clegg of  Facebook ’s  parent Meta (Review, Oct. 30), the positions are taken that the U.S. needs a national privacy law but for very different reasons. While Ms. Klobuchar advocates protection for the public, Mr. Clegg advocates cover for Meta.<br />The Privacy Act of 1974 was passed to balance the federal government’s need to maintain information about people with their individual rights. The four stated goals of the act were to restrict disclosure, increase individual access, increase the capacity for individuals to amend records and design a fair information practice. Since then, in almost every Congress, regulations have been proposed to modernize, enhance and apply these basic tenets to the private sector."
