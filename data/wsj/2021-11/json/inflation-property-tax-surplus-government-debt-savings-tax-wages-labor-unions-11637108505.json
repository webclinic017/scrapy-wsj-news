    "body": "Are city and county budget surpluses piling up in your area? (“The Inflation Revenue Dividend,” Review & Outlook, Nov. 13) Ask your local leadership to consider instituting a variable surplus property-tax credit to be applied toward the annual property-tax bill.<br />In the case of a large surplus (as in Manatee County, Fla., which has generated $100 million surpluses over the last several years), the tax credit will return some percent of it to the citizens, who will reinject it into the local economy. This will result in a much better return on the money (think: sales tax) than if it had sat stagnant in a governmental-controlled money-market fund, making one-tenth of 1%."
