    "body": "‘It is the test of a good religion whether you can joke about it,” G.K. Chesterton observed more than 100 years ago. The Laughing Prophet, as he was known, pointed out that people who are secure in their beliefs need not fear mockery. It’s those with shaky doctrines who can’t tolerate laughter. Today’s political radicals hold their views with the fervor of a religion, and by Chesterton’s measure they’re rather weak creeds.<br />As Dave Chappelle recently found out, mocking the left’s dearly held dogma will provoke outrage and uproar the likes of which would make the religious right of Satanic Panic fame look grounded and sane. You are allowed to make jokes, the left declares, as long as they target the right people—or rather, the people the left thinks are wrong. Anyone in their congregation is off limits."
