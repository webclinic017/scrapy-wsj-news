    "body": "Regarding Lawrence Goodman’s op-ed “How the Fed Rigs the Bond Market” (Nov. 18): The political independence of the Federal Reserve was a farce during the Johnson and Nixon years. During that time, we moved to fiat money and gargantuan deficit spending, resulting in years of high unemployment and inflation with low growth. The only brakes on Washington’s spending car eventually came from the bond vigilantes at Treasury auctions.<br />Now the Fed itself is the only auction participant that matters. It expands its bloated balance sheet with cheap Treasurys that no one in his right mind would otherwise buy. Unless a new Congress intervenes aggressively—a very unlikely scenario—we’re in for a rough ride. No wonder bitcoin is skyrocketing and gold-buying commercials crowd the airwaves."
