    "body": "WASHINGTON—While House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) is hoping for a vote as early as next week on a roughly $2 trillion social-spending and climate bill, the legislation is likely to be altered to have a chance at passing the Senate.<br />Democrats hold slim control of both chambers: Mrs. Pelosi can lose just three votes in the House, while Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) must keep his entire caucus together in the evenly divided Senate. In addition to demands from the different factions of the party, only certain provisions may qualify under Senate rules, because Democrats are using a budget maneuver to pass the bill with just a simple majority rather than the usual 60-vote threshold for legislation."
