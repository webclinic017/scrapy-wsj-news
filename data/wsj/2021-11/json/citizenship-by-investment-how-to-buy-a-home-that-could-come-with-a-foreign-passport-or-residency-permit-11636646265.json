    "body": "Marjorie Garrett loves the 3,500-square-foot custom home she and her husband built. The couple designed it for indoor-outdoor living, allowing them to slide open their window-walls in the morning and enjoy the breezes all day.<br />Of course, Mrs. Garrett, 67, occasionally has to relocate a scorpion. That’s because she and her husband, Jim Garrett, 70, live in Ojochal, Costa Rica, where they moved after retiring from the air-conditioner manufacturing business they owned in Frederick, Md. The two obtained temporary residency status in Costa Rica through the country’s residency-by-investment program by purchasing their home there, and they’re on the path to becoming permanent residents."
