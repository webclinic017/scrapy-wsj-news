    "body": "Looming in the background of President Bidenâ€™s choice for Federal Reserve chair is a political question: How much of a fight would Chairman Jerome Powell or governor Lael Brainard face to garner 50 votes in the U.S. Senate.<br />Mr. Biden hinted Tuesday that he could reveal his choice around the end of the week, though a White House official suggested the decision could slip into early next week. Advisers are making sure they have enough support for either candidate, according to people familiar with the matter."
