    "body": "Midland, Mich.<br />Winter is coming, and President Biden may soon make Michiganâ€™s hardest season even more painful. The White House is reportedly studying the consequences of shutting down Line 5, an oil and natural-gas liquids pipeline that carries heating and transportation fuels from Wisconsin through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario. A shutdown would be a replay of the Keystone XL cancellation, except this pipeline is already operating, so the damage would be much worse."
