    "body": "David Letterman, the former late-night TV host, had a popular segment he called “stupid pet tricks.” We thought of that recently as politicians invent news ways to blame inflation on everything except their own policies.<br />President Biden has blamed the OPEC cartel for producing too little oil and accused U.S. oil and gas producers of market manipulation. But our favorite stupid inflation trick has to be Elizabeth Warren’s attempt last week to blame a poultry cartel for the higher cost of your Thanksgiving dinner."
