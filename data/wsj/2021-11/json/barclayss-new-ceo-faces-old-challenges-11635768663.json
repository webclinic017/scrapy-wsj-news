    "body": "The circumstances surrounding Jes Staley’s departure from  Barclays  are certainly not the ones he or his employer would have chosen, but he has finished the job he was hired to do.<br />On Monday, the British bank said its chief executive would step down to contest preliminary findings by U.K. regulators about how he characterized his relationship with convicted sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein. C.S. Venkatakrishnan will now lead the lender. The JPMorgan Chase veteran joined Barclays in 2016 and was earmarked as the board’s “preferred candidate” over a year ago, the bank said. Shares in the bank fell nearly 2% in morning trading."
