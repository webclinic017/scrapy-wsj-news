    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Wednesday will consider a challenge to New York state’s century-old system for issuing concealed-weapons permits, potentially paving the way for a new expansion of the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.<br />After gun violence spiked in the early 20th century, New York enacted legislation limiting concealed-weapons licenses to individuals of “good moral character” with “proper cause” for a license. In Wednesday’s case, two gun owners from upstate Rensselaer County and a New York affiliate of the National Rifle Association argue the law is unconstitutional because it requires them to provide specific reasons for carrying concealed weapons in public beyond their general fear of crime."
