    "body": "Former Las Vegas Raiders coach Jon Gruden sued the National Football League and commissioner Roger Goodell, alleging that the league leaked emails containing racist and antigay comments by Gruden that led to his resignation last month.<br />The lawsuit, filed Thursday in Clark County District Court in Nevada, seeks damages for Grudenâ€™s financial losses as a result of his departure from the Raiders. In the complaint, Gruden accuses the league of deliberately releasing the emails, which the league had gathered as part of an investigation into the workplace culture at the Washington Football Team, in order to hurt his reputation."
