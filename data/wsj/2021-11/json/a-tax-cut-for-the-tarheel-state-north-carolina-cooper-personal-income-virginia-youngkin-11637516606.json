    "body": "Democrats in Washington are ignoring the partyâ€™s November election defeats, but the impact has been more salutary in the states. The latest example is North Carolina, where last week Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper signed a significant tax cut for individuals and business.<br />The tax cut is part of a two-year state budget that trades Republican priorities for pay increases for public workers. The GOP controls the Legislature and is aiming for a supermajority next year. Mr. Cooper went along with a bipartisan deal rather than veto and give the GOP the tax issue."
