    "body": "A few decades before the great cultural migration that drove creative artists to the New World in flight from the Russian Revolution and Hitler, the U.S. hosted two of Europe’s most important composers. Antonín Dvořák directed New York City’s National Conservatory of Music from 1892 to 1895. Gustav Mahler conducted the Metropolitan Opera and New York Philharmonic from 1908 to 1911. Dvořák was a fit for New York; Mahler was not. Dvořák, one learns, was a man at all times marvelously responsive to his environs. Mahler lived profoundly inside his own head.<br />Paul Griffiths has now added a third historic visitor: Ludwig van Beethoven. He arrived in Boston in 1833 at the invitation of the Handel and Haydn Society and composed an English-language oratorio titled “Job,” which received its premiere under the composer’s supervision. Of course, Beethoven died in 1827 and never visited Boston. But he did receive an 1823 invitation from the Handel and Haydn Society to write an oratorio—the catalyst for Mr. Griffiths’s quixotic and original work of historical fiction."
