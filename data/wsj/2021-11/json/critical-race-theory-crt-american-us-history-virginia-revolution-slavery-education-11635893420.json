    "body": "I agree with F.H. Buckley’s analysis of the corrosive effects of critical race theory on education (“History Is On the Ballot in Virginia,” op-ed, Oct. 22). Yet Mr. Buckley also offers a claim typical of critical race theory: “The Revolution would likely have failed had Virginia not joined in, and its slave-owning planters had been angered by Lord Dunmore’s emancipation proclamation.”<br />Lord Dunmore warned in April of 1775 that he would issue such a proclamation—an opportunistic one applying only to slaves willing to fight for the British—and did so that November. By that point, Virginia patriots had already protested against British taxes and sent delegates to two Continental Congresses. Virginia did not support the Revolution to protect slavery. To claim that it did, one must omit, embellish, play down and overemphasize, shaping the narrative to fit the agenda. This behavior plagues critical race theory and other overtly politicized frameworks for teaching history."
