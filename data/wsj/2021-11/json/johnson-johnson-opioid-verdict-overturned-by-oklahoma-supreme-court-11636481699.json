    "body": "The Oklahoma Supreme Court overturned a ruling that held  Johnson & Johnson  liable for contributing to the state’s opioid-addiction crisis, the second court decision this month to favor drugmakers in opioid lawsuits.<br />In its ruling Tuesday, the state Supreme Court took issue with the lower court’s application of the state’s public-nuisance law, arguing it doesn’t cover the “manufacturing, marketing and the selling of prescription opioids.”"
