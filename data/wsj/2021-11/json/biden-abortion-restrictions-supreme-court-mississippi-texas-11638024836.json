    "body": "As the Supreme Court prepares to consider a big test to abortion rights, President Biden is leading Democratic efforts to block new restrictions on the procedure, following a campaign shift toward the views of a liberal Democratic Party.<br />The court will hear arguments on Dec. 1 over a Mississippi law that seeks to ban most abortions after 15 weeks, giving the justices an opening to revisit the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision and later rulings that upheld a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion before fetal viability. Mr. Biden’s administration is challenging a Texas law that effectively bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy."
