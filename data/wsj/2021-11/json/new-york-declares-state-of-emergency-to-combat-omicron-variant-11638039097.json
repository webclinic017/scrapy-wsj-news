    "body": "New Yorkâ€™s governor declared a state of emergency to prepare for a possible Covid-19 surge from the new Omicron variant that is spreading around the globe.<br />The precautionary measure announced Friday is intended to help hospitals in the state prepare for a potential winter wave caused by the new variant, which the World Health Organization has said might be more transmissible and pose a greater risk of illness than existing strains of the coronavirus. New York is the first state to declare a state of emergency in response to the Omicron variant."
