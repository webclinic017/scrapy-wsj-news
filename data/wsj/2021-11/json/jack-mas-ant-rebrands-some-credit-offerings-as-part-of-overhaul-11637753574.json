    "body": "Ant Group Co. has started making it clear to customers if they are borrowing from outside lenders or from the company itself, as Jack Ma’s financial-technology giant continues to fall in line with Chinese regulations.<br />Before its wings were clipped by Beijing, Ant, via its payment and lifestyle app Alipay, offered consumer-credit services that were widely popular among Chinese consumers and small businesses. The products later became one of the key reasons for Chinese regulators to scuttle its blockbuster initial public offering, just two days before the scheduled listing in November last year."
