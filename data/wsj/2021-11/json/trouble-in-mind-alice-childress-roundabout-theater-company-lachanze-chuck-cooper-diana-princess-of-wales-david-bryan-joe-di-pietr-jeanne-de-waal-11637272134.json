    "body": "New York<br />The story of how Alice Childress’s “Trouble in Mind” finally got to Broadway would make a play all by itself. A sword-sharp satire of the demeaning things that Black actors once had to do to get work on stage and in films, it was first performed off Broadway in 1955. A group of producers (white, naturally) thought it had commercial potential and wanted to bring it to Broadway, but insisted that Childress give the play a reassuringly happy ending. She said no, the producers abandoned the production, and “Trouble in Mind,” though it was published intact and has since been widely staged elsewhere, never made it to Broadway—until now. The Roundabout Theatre Company is putting on “Trouble in Mind” in its 740-seat American Airlines Theatre with a deluxe cast led by LaChanze and Chuck Cooper, and the results are glorious to behold. George S. Kaufman is said to have quipped that “satire is what closes on Saturday night,” but if this one doesn’t draw crowds all the way to the end of its limited run, I’ll be shocked."
