    "body": "PayPal  is still feeling some of the effects of its breakup with  eBay  several years ago. But now it has a new relationship with  Amazon.com .<br />After huge growth through the pandemic, like most payments players, PayPal is facing tougher comparisons going forward as it seeks further expansion. But in addition to having to show it can keep up the momentum with e-commerce and other digital payments and services, it also has to make up for declining volumes from eBay. PayPal shares were down more than 10% Tuesday after posting earnings."
