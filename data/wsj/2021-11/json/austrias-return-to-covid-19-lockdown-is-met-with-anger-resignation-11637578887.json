    "body": "Austria on Monday became the first Western country to put its economy under partial lockdown, the toughest in an array of restrictions that are spreading across Europe, sometimes meeting violent protests, as governments seek to fend off a steep rise in Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations despite widespread vaccinations.<br />For the next 10 to 20 days, residents will have to stay home and all nonessential shops will close. While the rules include numerous exceptions—strolls, exercising and dog walking are allowed, as are traveling to offices and shopping for groceries and even Christmas trees—police said they would enforce the lockdown, especially in the evening."
