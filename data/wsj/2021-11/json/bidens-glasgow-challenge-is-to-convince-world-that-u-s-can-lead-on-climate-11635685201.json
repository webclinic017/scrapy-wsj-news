    "body": "President Biden heads to the climate summit in Glasgow aiming to show that the U.S. is ready to take a leadership role on global warming, but with few concrete options for rallying international support for the tough measures scientists say are needed.<br />The summit, which is sponsored by the United Nations and begins Sunday, provides a stage for world leaders to pledge their national commitments to stem global warming. They are also expected to wrangle over an array of thornier issues, including who should bear the biggest burden for cutting emissions."
