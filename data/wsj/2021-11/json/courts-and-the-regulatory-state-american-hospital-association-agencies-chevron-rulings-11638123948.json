    "body": "The Biden Administration is ramping up its rule by regulation. So it’s good timing that the Supreme Court will hear a case on Tuesday that provides an opportunity to revisit its Chevron precedent that has empowered and emboldened the administrative state.<br />American Hospital Association v. Becerra involves a technical issue over Medicare reimbursement rates for outpatient drugs. But the fundamental question is whether the government’s interpretation of its own regulatory authority merits judicial deference under Chevron (1984)."
