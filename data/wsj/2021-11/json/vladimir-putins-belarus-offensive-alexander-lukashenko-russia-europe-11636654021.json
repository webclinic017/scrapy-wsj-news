    "body": "Russia’s Vladimir Putin is causing trouble in Europe again, first by massing troops on the border with Ukraine and now with a refugee crisis and energy threats through his ally in Belarus. Western Europe is upset but has itself to blame for being so vulnerable.<br />Belarus dictator Alexander Lukashenko stole last year’s presidential election and arrested opposition leaders. His increasingly violent crackdown prompted several rounds of European Union sanctions. He has retaliated by facilitating the movement of mostly Middle Eastern migrants to Europe’s borders."
