    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Monday declined to review a federal foreign-intelligence court’s decision to keep secret its opinions authorizing the expansion of surveillance following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.<br />As is usual in such matters, the majority didn’t comment on its grounds for declining to consider the case. Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, dissented, arguing that the growing role of surveillance technology and its implications for democracy called for the Supreme Court’s review."
