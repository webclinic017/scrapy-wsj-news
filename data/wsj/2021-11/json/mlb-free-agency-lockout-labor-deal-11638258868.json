    "body": "Baseball front offices have finally shown what it takes for them to start signing players before Valentine’s Day: The threat of the entire sport shutting down for an indeterminate amount of time.<br />The current collective bargaining agreement between the franchise owners and the players’ union expires Wednesday at 11:59 p.m. ET, and the odds of them reaching a new deal by that time appear slim. Management would likely then initiate a lockout, freezing all transactions for as long as it takes for the two parties to settle the dispute, a process that could stretch for months."
