    "body": "WASHINGTON—Congress is moving closer to requiring women to register for the draft for the first time in American history.<br />A bipartisan provision included in both the House and Senate versions of a $777.9 billion annual defense policy bill would expand registration for the Selective Service to include young women alongside young men. The House passed its bill in September by a large bipartisan margin, and the Senate is expected to pass its version in the coming days. Lawmakers will then meet in closed-door negotiations to reconcile both chambers’ bills."
