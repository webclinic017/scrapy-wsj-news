    "body": "Christopher DeMuth’s op-ed “Why America Needs National Conservatism” (Nov. 13) is less than compelling.﻿First, he admonishes the conservative movement for being too reformist—“Burkean”—in the face of woke radicalism, without offering a coherent, more aggressive alternative strategy. This from a man who for more than two decades was president of the American Enterprise Institute, the definition of a Burkean think tank.<br />Then he informs us “I have been a libertarian since I was a little boy,” albeit taken aback by some of the more extreme conclusions of the philosophy. He is now an “empirical libertarian.”"
