    "body": "Regarding “Censoring the Pilgrims” (Review & Outlook, Nov. 23): As the author of a book on the Pilgrims, I had to research their relationship with the surrounding Wampanoag confederacy. The Pilgrims did build on land cleared and settled by the Patuxet tribe, which was wiped out by plague in the great dying of 1616-19; this was an unintentional gift. But their relationship with the Wampanoags was firm and peaceful for 50 years until King Philip’s War. This relationship was based on a treaty of mutual protection, signed on March 22, 1621, by Gov. John Carver and the sachem Ousamequin, better known as Massasoit. This was the first treaty between Native Americans and those coming to the New World.<br />The Wampanoags were important to the Pilgrims’ survival, assisting them in growing crops, hunting and fishing and understanding native edible plants. Their contribution is incalculable. The Pilgrims in return cared for their sick during an ensuing smallpox epidemic."
