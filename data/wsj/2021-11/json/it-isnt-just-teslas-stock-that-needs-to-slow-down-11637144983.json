    "body": "Whatever your view on Tesla, pulling money out of the car industry right now makes sense.<br />Two years ago, the world’s top 10 auto makers by market value outside China were together worth about $680 billion. Now they are valued at more than $2 trillion. Tesla has jumped from third place to an enormous lead, and this month electric-vehicle makers Rivian and Lucid replaced  Honda  and Ferrari in the ranking. Rivian’s stock has more than doubled since its initial public offering last Wednesday."
