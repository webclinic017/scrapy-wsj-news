    "body": "Prada ’s  first 10 years as a public company have been patchy. But the family-controlled luxury brand has a sharper new look and leader-in-waiting.<br />On Thursday, Prada set profitability, revenue and e-commerce targets at its first investor day since 2014. The fashion label wants to grow sales to €4.5 billion, or $5.1 billion, within a few years, up from the €3.2 billion it made in pre-Covid 2019. Prada is aiming for a 20% operating margin, compared with 11% currently, and wants to roughly double the size of its e-commerce business as a percentage of overall sales."
