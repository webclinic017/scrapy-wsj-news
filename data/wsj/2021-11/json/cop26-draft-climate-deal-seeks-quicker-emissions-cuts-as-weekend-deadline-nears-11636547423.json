    "body": "GLASGOW—The U.S. and China jointly pledged at the United Nations climate summit to step up actions to fight climate change in the coming decade, injecting talks here with a surprise show of cooperation between the two rivals and the world’s two biggest greenhouse-gas emitters.<br />But the two didn’t endorse a proposal by the U.K., the host of the summit, for countries to update their emissions-cutting plans by the end of next year. That proposal, which was floated earlier in the day, was seen as a way of bridging the divide between what governments have committed to cutting and what scientists think is needed to avoid the worst effects of climate change."
