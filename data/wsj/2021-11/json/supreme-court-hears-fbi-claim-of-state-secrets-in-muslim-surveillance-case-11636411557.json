    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court appeared divided at arguments on Monday over whether Muslim Americans who allege the FBI targeted them in 2006 because of their religion can proceed with a lawsuit that the government argues must be dismissed to protect state secrets.<br />The investigation itself, where the government sent a bodybuilder to infiltrate an Irvine, Calif., mosque in search of potential terrorists, isn’t a secret. Code-named Operation Flex, the investigation was disclosed in litigation years ago and became the subject of a 2012 public-radio documentary."
