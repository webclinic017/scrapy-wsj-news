    "body": "GLASGOW—President Biden returned home from the United Nations climate summit Wednesday, having used the opening days of the conference here to try to paint China and Russia as isolated holdouts to a global consensus over fighting climate change.<br />The president has staked his legacy at home and abroad in part on his ability to rally the international community to address climate change.
