    "body": "The roughly $1 trillion infrastructure package just passed by Congress will modestly help the economy in the short run while priming the country for slightly stronger growth in coming decades, economists say.<br />The law includes roughly $550 billion in additional spending on top of what the government already planned to spend over the next decade on infrastructure. About a fifth of the new spending is earmarked for building and repairing roads. Smaller components will be used to improve broadband networks, subway systems, passenger railways, airports, ports and power facilities."
