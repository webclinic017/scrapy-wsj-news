    "body": "IT’S -4 DEGREES Fahrenheit high in the mountains near Revelstoke, British Columbia, and ski filmmaker Katie Burrell has been standing in the snow for eight hours to capture the shot she seeks. For her, staying warm doesn’t merely stave off discomfort, it lets her get the job done. “If…your feet go numb, you can’t do anything,” the 33-year-old said. In addition to a Gore-Tex jacket, hat and gloves, the filmmaker relies on her “secret weapon”—a pair of battery-operated Therm-ic knee-high socks whose discreet control allows her to toggle between low, medium and high heat.<br />Futuristic warming gear like Ms. Burrell’s has become increasingly popular over the past few years—and not only among those who spend extended periods on mountain tops. The Warming Store in Philadelphia—which sells heated gear including battery-powered jackets, gloves and even camping chairs—experienced a surge in sales last winter, and is on track to sell 50% more such items this year than last, according to co-founder Justin Silverman. He attributes the boom to the prevalence of outdoor dining, exercising and socializing during the pandemic, but also to recent improvements in heat tech itself."
