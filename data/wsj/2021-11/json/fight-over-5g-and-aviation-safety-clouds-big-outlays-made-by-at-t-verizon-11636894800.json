    "body": "An unusual public dispute among federal agencies is playing out in Washington, delaying the rollout of 5G cellphone services and revealing government infighting that has plagued two U.S. administrations.<br />AT&T Inc.  and  Verizon Communications Inc.  earlier this month said they would delay the launch of some fifth-generation wireless services after the Federal Aviation Administration warned it could restrict U.S. airspace in bad weather if the networks were turned on as planned in December. The FAA warning came in the thick of cellphone carriersâ€™ network upgrade projects."
