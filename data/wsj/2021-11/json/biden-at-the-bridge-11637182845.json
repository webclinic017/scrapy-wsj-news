    "body": "When it comes to motivational speaking, President Joe Biden is no Kirby Smart. But this week Mr. Biden is gamely trying to sell his latest 13-figure spending law at a series of events in various states.<br />The first stop on the tour was a New Hampshire bridge that crosses the Pemigewasset River in the Woodstock area.
