    "body": "As Elizabeth Holmes takes the stand in the criminal case against her, her testimony faces a challenge: persuading jurors that whatever her missteps, she didn’t intend to defraud.<br />Over 11 weeks of testimony, prosecutors in the Theranos Inc. founder’s trial presented a narrative of a CEO who repeatedly fabricated the successes of her technology as she built a blood-testing startup that ultimately failed. They now have to hope they convinced jurors her behavior rose to the level of criminal fraud."
