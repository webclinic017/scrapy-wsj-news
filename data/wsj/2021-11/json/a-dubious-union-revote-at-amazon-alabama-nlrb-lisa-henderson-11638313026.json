    "body": "Organizing Amazon workers is the holy grail of today’s union movement, and labor chiefs and their allies in government won’t stop until they do. A ruling this week by a National Labor Relations Board official skirts labor law to give Big Labor a second chance to organize an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Ala.<br />Lisa Henderson, head of the NLRB’s southeast region, ruled Monday that employees must vote again on whether to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, after they rejected the union in April by 71% to 29%. Union organizers had to justify their embarrassing defeat, so they claim Amazon intimidated employees."
