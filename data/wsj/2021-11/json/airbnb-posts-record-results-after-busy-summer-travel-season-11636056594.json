    "body": "Airbnb Inc.  posted record revenue in the third quarter, punctuating the home-sharing company’s rebound from the collapse in bookings during the early days of the pandemic.<br />The three months covering much of the busy summer vacation period is typically the most lucrative for Airbnb. People resuming more normal travel patterns and other factors helped the company fill the rentals available on its platform. Airbnb said it is preparing for bumper Thanksgiving business, with bookings at the end of September up roughly 40% from the 2019 level."
