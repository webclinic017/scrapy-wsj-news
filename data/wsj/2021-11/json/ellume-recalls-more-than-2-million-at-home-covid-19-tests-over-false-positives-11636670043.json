    "body": "The Food and Drug Administration said more than 2 million at-home Covid-19 tests from Australia-based Ellume USA LLC have been recalled because of a number of false-positive results.<br />The federal agency categorized the recall as a Class I, its most serious classification. It said false-positive test results could lead to serious health issues including unnecessary treatments and isolation, delayed treatments of the actual illness and spread of Covid-19 if those who received false-positive results are clustered with those who accurately tested positive."
