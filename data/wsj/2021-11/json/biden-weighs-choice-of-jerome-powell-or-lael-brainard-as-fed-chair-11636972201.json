    "body": "President Biden is expected to decide as soon as this week whether to appoint Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell or governor Lael Brainard to a four-year term leading the central bank beginning next February.<br />Because Ms. Brainard’s views on inflation and interest rates have been similar this year to Mr. Powell’s, policy continuity seems likely no matter who is chosen."
