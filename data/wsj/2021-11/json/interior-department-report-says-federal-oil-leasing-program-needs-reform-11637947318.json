    "body": "Interior Department officials recommended that the Biden administration consider raising the royalty rate for oil-and-gas leasing on federal lands, as President Biden seeks to deliver on promises to address climate change amid high inflation.<br />In a report released on Friday, Interior officials urged President Biden to raise the government’s royalty rate—now a minimum of 12.5% for onshore production—for competitive leases, saying that the federal oil-and-gas leasing program “shortchanges taxpayers,” and that such rates haven’t been increased for 100 years. It also said the department should avoid leasing in areas where that activity could conflict with wildlife and cultural resources."
