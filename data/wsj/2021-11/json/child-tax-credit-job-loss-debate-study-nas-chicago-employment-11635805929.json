    "body": "Your editorial “The Child Allowance Welfare Trap” (Oct. 8) and Robert Doar’s online op-ed, “The Bad Science Behind the Child Tax Credit Expansion” (Oct. 29) question the evidence behind a 2019 consensus report from a nonpartisan committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), on which we served. Rejecting the report’s conclusions, you and Mr. Doar cite estimates reported in a working paper released recently by Bruce Meyer and other University of Chicago researchers.<br />The bedrock of all good science is peer review. Prof. Meyer’s working paper has not undergone rigorous peer review. By contrast, the NASEM report was reviewed by 13 experts, with the response to review overseen by two eminent economists with expertise relevant to the report."
