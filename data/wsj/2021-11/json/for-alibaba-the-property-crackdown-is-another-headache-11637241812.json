    "body": "China’s e-commerce giant  Alibaba ’s  annus horribilis may not be over yet. Its latest challenge is the slowing Chinese economy.<br />Alibaba on Thursday announced revenue and operating profit for the quarter ending in September that was lower than analysts’ estimates on S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue last quarter increased 29% year on year, but growth would have been only 16% excluding the contribution of supermarket chain Sun Art, in which Alibaba acquired a controlling stake last year."
