    "body": "Regarding “Lessons of the Progressive Fall” (Review & Outlook, Nov. 4): Glenn Youngkin’s victory in Virginia should be attributed in large part to the presence of video cameras in the classrooms. It was the video of remote learning that stimulated parents to object to school abuses.<br />For many years our schools have worked to keep parents out of the classroom. Seventy years ago it was accepted practice for parents to come into a classroom to observe. Using the mantra of security, it is now virtually impossible for a parent to see what is being taught in the schools. This must change. School boards grew out of the culture of the one-room schoolhouse. Local citizens erected a school, hired a teacher and then supervised the school. The teacher was brought in as an employee. A return to traditional school-board management is a must."
