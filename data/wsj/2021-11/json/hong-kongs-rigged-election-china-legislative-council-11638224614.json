    "body": "We bring you this message from Hong Kong because China’s Communist Party wants the world to forget how it crushed the autonomy it promised to the territory. On Monday authorities issued arrest warrants for two pro-democracy exiles who used social media to recommend that Hong Kongers boycott sham legislative elections scheduled for December.<br />Former pro-democracy lawmaker Ted Hui urged Hong Kongers to protest by casting blank ballots, and former district councillor Yau Man-chun encouraged a boycott. Both now face multiple charges for “engaging [in] illegal conduct of inciting another person not to vote, or to cast invalid vote, by activity in public during election period,” authorities said Monday. The penalty is up to three years in prison."
