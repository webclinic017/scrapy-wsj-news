    "body": "ON THE FOURTH floor of the Hermès men’s store on New York’s Madison Avenue lies a cozy atelier where choosy shoppers can sip champagne, leaf through fabric books and order custom clothes. Many clients stop in for traditional bespoke suits and dress shirts, but some covet a more modern, and perhaps superfluous, personalized piece: a made-to-order hoodie. For a princely $1,925, you can pick from 27 color options, have a tailor take your shoulder and torso measurements and, approximately 12 weeks later, walk away in a one-of-a-kind, fit-to-you, zip-up cashmere hoodie.<br />Hermès’s premium hoodie represents the latest move in custom clothing, one keenly attuned to the relaxed way men dress now. Today’s titans of industry eschew suits, custom or otherwise. Elon Musk wears black T-shirts, Mark Zuckerberg plans for the metaverse in forgettable sweaters and media moguls favor outdoorsy fleece vests. You, too, might have spent the past 22 months swaddled in sweats—or at least have swapped your blazers for forgiving knits."
