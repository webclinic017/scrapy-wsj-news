    "body": "Austin, Texas<br />Nothing makes me feel more Texan than rocketing down a 75-mile-an-hour highway in a gas guzzler while blasting classic country radio. Stations that play country music are ubiquitous—it’s the most popular radio genre—but in Texas, the deep tracks are a little deeper and George Strait plays every hour. KVET Austin is my station of choice, and tuning in has helped me connect to the city since I moved here from New York over the summer."
