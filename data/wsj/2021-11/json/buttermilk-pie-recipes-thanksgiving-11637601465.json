    "body": "IN THE HANDS OF Gabrielle E.W. Carter, a slice of buttermilk pie is more than dessert.<br />On her family’s Eastern North Carolina homestead, Ms. Carter sees cooking as cultural preservation—of her family’s traditions and those of the Black diaspora. “It was really about honoring and preserving ingredients from my grandfather’s backyard garden,” she said, via email, of her coral-hued smoked-cantaloupe buttermilk pie. “He grows cantaloupe every year, and this year I gifted him a plant I started and didn’t have room for. He didn’t love how small they turned out, but he shared some with me.” She smoked the melons over applewood and roasted them until they were candied. Finally she blended them into a buttermilk base with some smoked salt and nutmeg, and she baked that in a cornmeal crust. “Buttermilk pie is love,” she explained, “so I figured I’d start there.”"
