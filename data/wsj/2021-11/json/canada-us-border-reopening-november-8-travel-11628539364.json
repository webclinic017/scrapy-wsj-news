    "body": "For more than 16 months, the U.S. and Canada turned away tourists at entry points across the 5,500-mile land border in an effort to contain further spread of Covid-19. On Monday, Aug. 9, Canada began allowing fully vaccinated Americans to enter the country again, and on Sept. 7, Canada expanded that reopening to include fully vaccinated visitors from other countries.<br />The U.S. said it would begin allowing fully vaccinated foreign nationals to cross the land borders from Canada and Mexico for non-essential purposes beginning Nov. 8. U.S. border officials warn of possible delays at land-entry points, as they anticipate high levels of traffic while officers try to verify compliance with public-health measures."
