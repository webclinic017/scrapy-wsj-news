    "body": "Bigger Thanksgiving gatherings mean bigger meals—and fuller shopping carts are putting supermarkets to the test, as many of them are still struggling to fill shelves and staff stores.<br />Grocery chains said they have been overstocking holiday-meal staples like spices and pumpkin-pie mixes, and preparing more cooked dishes.
