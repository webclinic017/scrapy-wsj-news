    "body": "In business it’s called a kitchen-sink write-off, acknowledging a bunch of blunders and embarrassments in a single earnings revision, then quickly moving on.<br />That’s what you got from a long piece by CNN acknowledging the phoniness of the Steele dossier, though even CNN’s accounting of what CNN got wrong gets things wrong. The Justice Department inspector general, “after a lengthy probe,” did not say the FBI’s Trump investigation “was free of political bias.” His plain words said he found no “documentary or testimonial evidence” of political bias to explain actions for which “no satisfactory explanations” had been offered."
