    "body": "In a recent column about financial advisers, you noted that their fees are increasing. My planner’s fee, as is common, is based on the size of my nest egg. My questions: What’s your opinion about calculating fees in this way? Is this a good method? Is there a better one? I’ve done well with my adviser through the years.<br />I’m glad to hear you’re happy with your adviser. But I worry that many retirees who are billed as you describe are paying too much for the help they’re receiving. That’s because they don’t understand how these particular fees actually work—and/or because they fall victim to inertia."
