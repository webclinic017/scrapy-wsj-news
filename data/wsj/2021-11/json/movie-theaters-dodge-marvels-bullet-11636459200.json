    "body": "Movies might no longer be critic-proof in a post-pandemic world. The question is whether critic-resistant is good enough.<br />“Eternals,” the latest release from  Disney ’s  Marvel universe, made its box-office debut over the weekend. It has garnered the weakest reviews of the franchise, with a Rotten Tomatoes score of 48 as of Monday. That is far below the 86 score that Marvel movies made under the Disney banner have averaged since the release of the first Avengers film in 2012. And it is well under the 91 that the last Marvel outing—“Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings”—managed with its release just two months prior."
