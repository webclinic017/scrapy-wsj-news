    "body": "‘Eternals” answers a question of cosmic proportions, as befits a Marvel release with a whole new cast of supercharacters. The question is how well Chloé Zhao, a singularly gifted filmmaker (“Nomadland”) accustomed to working on a modest scale, was able to do as the director and co-writer of a superexpensive, supercomplicated and superlong action adventure.<br />The answer is more than well enough, even though the story, stretched out over 157 minutes, is rambling and repetitive. (There’s also the question of whether the Eternals, a race of immortal beings who arrived on Earth over 7,000 years ago, can save humanity from the predations of the Deviants, their monstrously evil counterparts, but first things first.) The production’s graphics are striking, with shimmering gold filigrees as a motif. The physical locations are spectacular, a surprise because most examples of the genre are shot in the augmented reality of high-tech soundstages. The spirit of Ms. Zhao’s film—and it is Ms. Zhao’s film—ranges from buoyant to playful during the downtime between generic battles to the almost death. Some of the Eternals we get to meet have grown fond of the human race, despite its endless foibles, and they express their affection with a warmth that’s rare in comic-book epics. What is there to say? Speaking as an earthling, one likes to be liked."
