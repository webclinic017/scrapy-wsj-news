    "body": "There were many news reports during the Obama administration that the Justice Department and other agencies were engaging in a fraud on taxpayers through a process called “sue and settle.” In these cases, an organization or group would sue the government for some alleged wrong. The suit would wind on for a while, and then the Justice Department would announce that it had been settled, with a generous payment to the allegedly aggrieved party. Sometimes companies and groups would get portions of the settlement, even though they had not actually suffered any injury or were not even parties to the original suit.<br />In 2013, for example, the  New York Times  reported that over the objections of career Justice Department lawyers, “the Obama administration’s political appointees at the Justice and Agriculture Departments . . . committed $1.33 billion to compensate not just the 91 plaintiffs but thousands of Hispanic and female farmers who had never claimed bias in court.”"
