    "body": "Walt Disney Co.  is marking the two-year anniversary of its flagship streaming service with a blitz of programming and promotions that it hopes will help turn the tide on a slowdown in new subscribers.<br />The company is trying to woo subscribers with perks at its theme parks and by premiering recent hit films like “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” on Disney+ to mark the streaming service’s anniversary, which comes days after Disney’s fourth-quarter earnings showed a disappointing two million new sign-ups in the quarter."
