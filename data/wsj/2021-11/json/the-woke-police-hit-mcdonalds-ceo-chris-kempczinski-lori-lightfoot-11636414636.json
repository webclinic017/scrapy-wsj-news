    "body": "Democratic pundits have been full of warnings since last Tuesday that the party should drop its woke cancel culture, but that message apparently hasn’t made it to Chicago. That’s where Chris Kempczinski, the CEO of  McDonald’s ,  has been pounded into making an apology for a text he sent to Mayor Lori Lightfoot about shootings in the murder-wracked city.<br />Mr. Kempczinski sent the text in April, shortly after the mayor visited McDonald’s headquarters after 7-year-old Jaslyn Adams was killed in her father’s car outside a McDonald’s restaurant. Thirteen-year-old Adam Toledo was fatally shot by police a month earlier."
