    "body": "I disagree with Prof. Jacob Borden that “Drilling in Yellowstone Could Save America,” (op-ed, Oct. 29). Yellowstone’s geysers and hot springs result from relatively shallow magma. Energy extraction from similar deposits has failed repeatedly because rock-fracture leakage cools the local region. Both the Los Alamos Hot Dry Rock geothermal energy program and a similar British project in Cornwall were terminated. An attempt to extract energy from the magma under Kilauea Iki within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park also failed. Drilling technologies have improved, but geothermal-energy recovery still depends on hydrology and net energy gain, not loss. Prof. Borden’s argument doesn’t hold water.<br />James Bresee"
