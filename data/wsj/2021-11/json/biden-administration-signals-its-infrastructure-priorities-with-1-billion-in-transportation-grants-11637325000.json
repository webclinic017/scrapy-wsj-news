    "body": "The Biden administration on Friday announced some $1 billion in transportation grants for local projects, offering clues about its spending priorities as it gets ready to allocate funds from the roughly $1 trillion infrastructure package signed into law this week.<br />The grants, known as Rebuilding American Infrastructure With Sustainability and Equity, or Raise, have been awarded for more than a decade. The latest round of applications is separate from the new infrastructure legislation but it points to the types of projects the administration is likely to favor."
