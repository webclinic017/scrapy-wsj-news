    "body": "Nothing will do more to slow the rate of near-term global warming than cutting an odorless, colorless greenhouse gas—not carbon dioxide but methane. In many cases, reductions are virtually cost-free, and will make it cheaper to deal with the expensive impacts of an unstable climate.<br />Even though 99 times as much CO2 as methane is released each day, methane causes more near-term climate change than all the CO2 from burning fossil fuels. CO2 is still the biggest long-term climate problem, because it lingers in the atmosphere for centuries, while methane degrades in about a decade. But that also means if we stop replenishing the methane, we reap a substantial and continuing benefit. Less methane means less “radiative forcing,” which drives bigger rainfall events, droughts and stronger hurricanes."
