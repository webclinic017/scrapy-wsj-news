    "body": "Government reports released last week have put inflation on top of the economic-policy agenda. During the past year, consumer prices rose by 6.2%, the fastest rate in more than three decades, and wholesale prices rose by 8.6%. The core price index, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, rose 4.6%.<br />Many of the specifics are eye-popping. The price of fuel oil has risen by 59% in the past 12 months, gasoline by 50%, and home-delivered natural gas by 28%. The cost of new cars and trucks is up 10%, used cars and trucks 26%, car and truck rentals 39%. Furniture costs 12% more; rents and housing prices are moving up fast. Grade A eggs are up to $1.82 a dozen from $1.41 a year ago; a pound of chuck roast rose to $7.40 from $5.75."
