    "body": "Regarding your editorial “About Those Terrorist Parents” (Oct. 27): Thank God for the parents speaking up in defense of their children. For the attorney general to label them terrorists is not only partisan politics at its finest but also hypocritical. Black Lives Matter rioters could burn buildings, loot, harass normal citizens, jump on cars and worse. That was called “peaceful protest.”<br />Erin Rouse"
