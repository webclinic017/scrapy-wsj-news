    "body": "In his otherwise trenchant op-ed on leadership issues in federal law enforcement (“The FBI Needs a Wray of Courage,” Oct. 18), my friend Thomas J. Baker, a distinguished former FBI special agent, mangled the history of the Watergate era with this assertion about the director of the FBI in the first Nixon term: “[J. Edgar] Hoover pushed back against the demands of President Nixon and Attorney General John Mitchell for ‘black-bag operations’ against political enemies.”<br />Mr. Baker was wrong to attribute such demands to John Mitchell. The scholarly literature on the Nixon presidency has long recorded, and my own research confirmed, that it was to Attorney General Mitchell that Director Hoover appealed for assistance when President Nixon ordered the bureau, in July 1970, to implement the illegal measures outlined in the so-called Huston Plan. This included a broad-ranging program of counter-measures, including black-bag jobs, aimed at domestic terror groups, antiwar radicals and others who posed a threat to national security at the time. Testimony at the 1973 Senate Watergate hearings established that it was after Mitchell’s intervention that Nixon swiftly rescinded his approval of the Huston Plan."
