    "body": "New York<br />Polychromed sculpture from Spain and the Spanish New World has long been largely overlooked, even by the Hispanic Society Museum & Library, a little-visited jewel in New York’s Washington Heights. Established in 1904 by the collector and philanthropist Archer M. Huntington (1870-1955), it has been shuttered for almost five years for renovation. “Gilded Figures: Wood and Clay Made Flesh,” a compelling show of 22 painted sculptures from 1500 to 1800 that inaugurates the museum’s gradual reopening, highlights art from its larger, storied collection that often goes unnoticed. Organized by Patrick Lenaghan, curator of prints, photographs and sculpture, and Hélène Fontoira Marzin, head of conservation, it reflects a sea change in critical thinking, and, as many of the works on view are newly acquired, a burgeoning taste for the medium. In a single gallery of these richly decorated and elaborately illusionistic works, so different from unpainted European sculpture, historic polychromed sculpture is enshrined at the very heart of Spanish culture."
