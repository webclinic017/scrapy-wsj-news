    "sub_head": "Prices for the biofuel have surged, rekindling a debate about whether itâ€™s contributing to pain at the pump",
    "category_1": "U.S.",
    "time": "2021-11-24 10:59:00",
    "body": "Ethanol prices have skyrocketed to their highest level in a decade, contributing to surging U.S. gasoline prices as oil refiners pay more for the biofuel they are required to blend with their products.<br />The price spike is adding grist to a yearslong political debate over the federal ethanol blending mandate, known as the Renewable Fuel Standard. Politicians from oil-and-gas states have sought to repeal the requirement, calling it ineffective and expensive, while corn-state politicians have defended it, arguing it has added to U.S. fuel supplies and decreased consumer costs."
