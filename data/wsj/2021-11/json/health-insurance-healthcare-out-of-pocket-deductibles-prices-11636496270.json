    "body": "The article “$100,000 in Debt: Arbitrary Hospital Prices Hit Some Hard” (Page One, Oct. 29) illustrates the most important problem in healthcare today, but it isn’t the price. The hospital pricing mechanism is certainly out of whack, but the family in the article faced an insurance policy with an unaffordable out-of-pocket maximum and an unregulated insurance carrier’s determination of medical necessity.<br />Many who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid have health insurance that doesn’t adequately cover the expense of a health catastrophe. We need programs that offer assistance so that everyone has adequate insurance. In such a system the government would pitch in to support the premiums necessary for a family to have a deductible, coinsurance and out-of-pocket maximum that it can afford. State departments of insurance also should wake up and rein in insurance carriers’ determination of medical necessity, which often doesn’t keep pace with innovations in healthcare."
