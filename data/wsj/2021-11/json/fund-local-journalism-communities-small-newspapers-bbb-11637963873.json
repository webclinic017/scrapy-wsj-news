    "body": "In “The Kamikaze Democrats” (Review & Outlook, Nov. 22), the editorial board describes the Local Journalism Sustainability Act, a portion of which was included in the House’s Build Back Better bill, as a “$1.7 billion subsidy for local journalists, most of whom are left of center.” Maybe that’s how national news organizations think, but most journalists that I know are more interested in covering the news of their communities without a slant in either direction.<br />The Local Journalism Sustainability Act would help local journalists, not the big national operations. Local news is created and consumed differently than national news, and according to a 2019 Knight-Gallup study, more people believe their local news organizations are accomplishing most of the key tasks of informing their communities. Without a local news organization, where can a community get information about its school board or mayor’s race? How about in rural communities without other viable news sources?"
