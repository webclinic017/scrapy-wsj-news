    "body": "Rather than a staid gold wedding band, some grooms-to-be are choosing bands made from unorthodox materials like a used Jack Daniel’s cask or a dinosaur bone. Such curiosites come from Manly Bands, a five-year-old Utah-based outfit that specializes in men’s wedding rings that, as its advertising attests, are “not your ordinary bands.” Its top-sellers include $275 coal-black tungsten rings and a $325 rose-gold bauble inlaid with deer antler, turquoise and wood. Manly indeed. The company has apparently found an audience among unconventional fiancés: It said it sells about 20,000 rings per month.<br />The fallback ring style for many grooms remains a solid gold band, like their fathers wore and their grandfathers before that. But in recent years, companies like Manly Bands, Ring Bear and Brilliant Earth have broken from the tradition. These startups (most of which only sell online) create bands that range from slightly spruced up to absolutely extravagant. Ring Bear, a year-old Washington outfit, offers a tasteful $699 platinum ring with barely perceptible ribbing on the edges. Far higher up the financial scale, even gemstone stalwart Tiffany & Co. is deviating from convention, selling a $6,200 rose-gold ring encrusted with a royal ribbon of pavé diamonds."
