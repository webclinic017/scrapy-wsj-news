    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House Judiciary Committee passed bipartisan legislation on Wednesday to require federal judges to report more promptly their financial holdings and stock trades, sending the bill to the U.S. House floor less than a month after it was introduced.<br />Introduced in response to articles in The Wall Street Journal, the legislation is meant to address a longstanding problem: that judges’ financial disclosures aren’t online, are cumbersome to request and sometimes take years to access."
