    "body": "A HIGH-TECH Polaroid camera might have seemed out of place on last year’s gift list—when none of us was doing anything particularly worth photographing. Now that we can finally reunite with friends and parents and even cousins (and make sincerely funny faces for the group’s photographer), the gifting calculus is a bit different. When seeking presents for fans of gear, gadgets and all things geeky, our editors focused on gizmos, accessories and indulgences that promise to dispel some of the uneasiness that’s permeated much of the past 20 months. Please find below ideas to cheer up your spouse’s tool cabinet, distract your kids on the flights we can finally take, and, yes, photograph it all in instant style.<br />Lunii’s My Fabulous Storyteller lets three-to-10-year-olds build their own story-time adventures. With the spin of a knob on this screen-free device, kids can choose one of two characters (Ben or Suzanne), a setting (a castle perhaps), a ghost or pirate as a source of conflict and an important object like a key. Each of the included 48 stories lasts a few minutes. Others are available from about $13 each. Add a personal touch by recording stories in your voice (or grandma’s). $80, lunii.com"
