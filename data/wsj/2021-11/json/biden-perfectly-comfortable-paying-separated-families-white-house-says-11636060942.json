    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden is “perfectly comfortable” with his administration paying immigrant families to resolve lawsuits alleging they suffered trauma from being separated after illegally crossing the Mexico border, a White House spokeswoman said Thursday, in a bid to clarify Mr. Biden’s comment a day earlier that such payouts weren’t going to happen.<br />“If it saves taxpayer dollars and puts the disastrous history of the previous administration’s use of zero tolerance and family separation behind us, the president is perfectly comfortable with the Department of Justice settling with the individuals and families who are currently in litigation with the U.S. government,” spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said."
