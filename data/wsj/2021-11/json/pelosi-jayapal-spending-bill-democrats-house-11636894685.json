    "body": "WASHINGTON—House Democrats will return this week with the goal of passing a roughly $2 trillion social spending and climate package. To be successful, members must remain united amid intraparty friction that some lawmakers say is the worst they have seen in their time in Congress.<br />The tensions ramped up this month as Democrats worked to pass their  separate $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, which has been linked for months with the larger spending package. Party leaders emerged victorious on the infrastructure bill, but only because 13 Republicans brought it over the finish line after six Democrats voted no, protesting a decision to delay the social spending bill."
