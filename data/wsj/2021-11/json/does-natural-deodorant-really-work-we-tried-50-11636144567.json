    "body": "ON A PARTICULARLY sweltering day this summer, I found myself applying—and reapplying—deodorant. As I swiped and swiped again, it struck me that I had no idea what was in the chalky, drugstore-bought formulas I’ve been diligently smearing on my underarms for over a decade. Yes, the ingredients are usually listed on the applicators—cyclopentasiloxane, dimethicone were printed on the back of a recent stick. But what layperson knows what those are? Or whether they’re good for your delicate sweat glands?<br />So this fall, after being bombarded by Instagram ads and influencer posts touting natural deodorant, I decided to give it a try. I assumed “natural” indicated simple ingredients that were easy to pronounce. But determining what I should put in my armpits was harder than I thought, and I was skeptical about whether this stuff could keep my underarms dry and odor-free."
