    "body": "When New York’s teams play someday at the soon-to-be named Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, their fans and players who live in the Empire State will be able enjoy all the stadium has to offer, except for one thing: its sponsor’s services.<br />Like a number of popular cryptocurrency brokers and wallets, digital-currency company Crypto.com doesn’t offer services to residents of the state of New York. The state’s financial-services regulator in 2015 adopted rules for a special license for “virtual currency” firms, known as a BitLicense, and Crypto.com isn’t listed as having one."
