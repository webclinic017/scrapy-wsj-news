    "body": "T-Mobile US Inc.  faces a dilemma of its own making: sky-high expectations.<br />The cellular operator plans to report third-quarter results Tuesday to an investor base spoiled by years of superlative growth. It follows  AT&T Inc.  and  Verizon Communications Inc.,  both of which last month reported their strongest wireless customer gains in years. The surge was unusual for two companies more used to defending their market share than taking it."
