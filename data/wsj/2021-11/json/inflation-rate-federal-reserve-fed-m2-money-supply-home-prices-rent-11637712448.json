    "body": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s inflation record is much worse than official statistics show (“Biden Signs Up for Powell’s Inflation,” Review & Outlook, Nov. 23). As reported, consumer price inflation is the highest in 30 years. Based on actual prices, it is one of the highest inflation rates of the postwar period, matching the double-digit increases of the 1970s and early ’80s.<br />In the 1970s, the change in house prices counted as inflation, whereas today it’s what people can hypothetically be charged for rent that counts. The 6% increase in inflation in the past year would be 10%-plus using 1970s methods, since house prices are up nearly 20%, while owner rents are up 3%."
