    "body": "In a deeply conservative Utah county, a Republican prosecutor has announced that he will no longer seek the death penalty in any of his cases, joining a growing movement of conservatives across the country pushing for an end to capital punishment.<br />The move by Utah County Attorney David Leavitt, which was prompted, he said, by growing concern over the morality and cost of capital punishment, has caused anguish for two families who have waited four years hoping to see the man accused of killing two teenagers sentenced to death. Mr. Leavitt sat down with the victimsâ€™ families in September, just before he announced he would no longer seek the death penalty in cases."
