    "body": "WOODSTOCK, N. H.—President Biden visited an aging New Hampshire bridge to begin a new phase of the sales pitch for the bipartisan infrastructure law, as Democrats debate the heathcare, education and climate-change plan that represents another central piece of his agenda.<br />Following a White House bill-signing event Monday attended by Democrats and Republicans, Mr. Biden traveled Tuesday to Woodstock, N.H., to the NH 175 bridge over the Pemigewasset River. The White House said the span was rated as structurally deficient and has been on the state’s red list of bridges in poor condition since 2013."
