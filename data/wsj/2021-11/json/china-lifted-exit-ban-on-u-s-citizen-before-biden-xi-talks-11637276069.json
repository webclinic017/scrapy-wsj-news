    "body": "Days before the leaders of the U.S. and China convened a virtual summit this week, China quietly withdrew an American citizen’s ban on leaving the country and the U.S. sent back to China seven of its nationals who had served prison sentences in the U.S., American officials say.<br />Chinese authorities permitted a Seattle-area man, Daniel Hsu, to leave the country for the first time since 2017, according to one of the U.S. officials. While Chinese authorities hadn’t said Mr. Hsu had done anything wrong in China, he told the Associated Press last year that local authorities barred him from leaving in an apparent effort to pressure his father, who is in the U.S., to return to face charges in China. The family couldn’t be reached."
