    "body": "The Biden administration will remove a former Colombian rebel group from a list of foreign terrorist organizations, a measure intended to demonstrate American support for a fragile peace agreement with the guerrillas in Colombia, said U.S. and congressional officials with knowledge of the coming announcement.<br />The officials said the move could come this week, coinciding with the five-year anniversary of the historic peace accord between then-President Juan Manuel Santos and rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. Negotiated with U.S. support, the agreement ended a 52-year-conflict and resulted in Mr. Santos winning the Nobel Peace Prize."
