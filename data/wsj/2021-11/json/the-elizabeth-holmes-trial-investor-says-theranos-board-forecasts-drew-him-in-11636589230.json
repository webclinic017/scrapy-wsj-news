    "body": "SAN JOSE, Calif.â€”A Texas money manager who invested more than $1 million in Theranos Inc. when it was still an early-stage healthcare startup took the stand Wednesday in the criminal-fraud trial of founder Elizabeth Holmes to detail the promises she made that helped convince him to back the company.<br />The testimony of Alan Eisenman underpins one of the wire fraud charges Ms. Holmes faces in a 12-count indictment, and builds on similar stories jurors have heard from other investors at trial."
