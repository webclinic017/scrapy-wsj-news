    "body": "My 6-year-old son was watching basketball in our kitchen when he grinned at me, pointed at a player’s head and said, “Hey, they are wearing kippahs, that’s so cool.” The players ran down the court passing the basketball to one another, confidently anticipating their teammates’ moves. Then guard Ryan Turell made a shot. The Yeshiva University Maccabees celebrated, and we cheered loudly.<br />The team has won 43 straight games—the longest active winning streak in the National College Athletic Association. The Division III team is filled with hardworking athletes fueled by grit, determination and faith. Several players wear kippoth, the traditional Jewish skullcaps my son noticed."
