    "body": "Negotiations over the $4 trillion spending bill are consuming Washington, but President Biden’s effort to supercharge the regulatory state is also steadily advancing. The latest example is his nomination of progressive partisan Gigi Sohn to the Federal Communications Commission.<br />The White House last month hailed Ms. Sohn as “one of the nation’s leading public advocates for open, affordable, and democratic communications networks.” Translation: She favors deploying the agency’s regulatory power to shackle broadband providers and silence conservative voices."
