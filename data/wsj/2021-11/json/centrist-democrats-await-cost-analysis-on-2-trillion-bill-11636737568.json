    "body": "WASHINGTON—House Democrats’ hopes of passing their $2 trillion social-spending and climate package next week will hinge in part on how much a nonpartisan scorekeeper estimates the bill will cost and how much revenue it raises.<br />Five centrist House Democrats who want to ensure the bill is fully paid for blocked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) from moving forward with a vote on the legislation last week, insisting that the Congressional Budget Office first analyze the bill. The group’s members committed to supporting the bill next week as long as the CBO’s view on spending and revenue was consistent with the Biden administration’s estimates."
