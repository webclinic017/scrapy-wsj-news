    "body": "The Biden administration is moving to close gaps between House and Senate Democrats on its roughly $2 trillion education, healthcare and climate package, so it can finalize the bill that serves as the centerpiece of the president’s agenda.<br />“We will work with every member of the Senate on this bill,” said Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council, which advises the president on U.S. and global economic policy. “But I think that because of that work over several months, we really do now have a good understanding of where the consensus lies.”"
