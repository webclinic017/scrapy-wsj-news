    "body": "The Chinese Communist Party recently adopted a landmark resolution hailing the country’s accomplishments under President Xi Jinping. The communiqué, published after last week’s Sixth Plenum meeting, made clear that Mr. Xi’s already expansive power will grow. The effects of this will be felt around the world, but few groups stand to suffer as much as Tibetans.<br />The party’s communiqué mentions “national rejuvenation” eight times. The phrase may sound harmless, if a bit nationalistic. Yet a key component of national rejuvenation is unification, which in Beijing’s view requires the destruction of minority cultures. Tibetans—who have been struggling against the party’s attempts to erase their identity for more than 60 years—understand the danger of “national rejuvenation” all too well."
