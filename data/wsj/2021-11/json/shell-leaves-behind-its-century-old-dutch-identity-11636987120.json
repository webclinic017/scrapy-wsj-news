    "body": "Royal Dutch Shell  PLC’s plan to consolidate its share structure, move its headquarters to London and drop Royal Dutch from its name would end its identity as an Anglo-Dutch company after more than a century.<br />Started by London antique dealer Marcus Samuel in 1833 to import exotic shells from Asia, the Shell Trading & Transport Co., as it was renamed in 1897, became one of the world’s early major oil companies and helped pioneer the use of the oil tanker to transport fuel over long distances. It opened its first refinery in Borneo in modern Indonesia—then a Dutch colony—that same year."
