    "body": "WASHINGTON—Immigrants caught in yearslong green-card backlogs could become permanent residents in the U.S. much faster because of a little-noticed immigration provision tucked into Democrats’ $1.85 trillion social-spending and climate package.<br />While Democrats haggle over the size and scope of legal protections for so-called Dreamers and other immigrants in the country illegally, they have also included a measure in the House bill that would recover hundreds of thousands of unused green cards over the last several decades and make them available to applicants waiting in line. Under the proposal, the unused green cards, which confer permanent U.S. residency, would be “recaptured” or put back in circulation and remain available until they are issued."
