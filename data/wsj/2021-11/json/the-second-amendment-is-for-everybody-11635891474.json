    "body": "Thirteen years after the Supreme Court recognized the true meaning of the Second Amendment in D.C. v. Heller (2008), it’s still a “disfavored” right, as Justice Clarence Thomas once put it. Case in point: The question Wednesday at the Court is whether ordinary New Yorkers lose the right to “bear Arms” in self-defense whenever they walk out their front doors.<br />New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen could close a gap in the High Court’s jurisprudence that has persisted too long. Regular citizens in New York face an almost insuperable bar if they want to bear a firearm for personal defense. Openly carrying a handgun is banned. And with certain exceptions, such as for judges and prison workers, getting a concealed-carry license requires demonstrating “proper cause.”"
