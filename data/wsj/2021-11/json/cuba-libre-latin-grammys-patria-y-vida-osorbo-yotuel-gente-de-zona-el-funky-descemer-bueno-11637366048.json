    "body": "The Latin Grammy award for song of the year last week went to “Patria y Vida”—Homeland and Life—and Hollywood may be having a case of the vapors. But the music industry’s sudden solidarity with repressed Cuban artists is progress.<br />The title of “Patria y Vida” is a rejection of the Cuban revolutionary slogan “Homeland or Death.” Written and recorded by musicians on the island and in the U.S., the song rebukes an illegitimate dictatorship that has lasted for 62 years. “Who told you that Cuba is yours,” the song dares to ask. “If my Cuba belongs to all my people your time is up, the silence is broken.”"
