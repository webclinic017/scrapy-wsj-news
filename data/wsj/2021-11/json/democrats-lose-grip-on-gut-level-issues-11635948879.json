    "body": "There will be a lot of sophisticated analysis of Tuesday’s election results, but the most important takeaway may be the simplest.<br />In their totality, Tuesday’s election results suggest Democrats are suffering because they’ve lost control of two issues of gut-level importance to voters: education and public safety. That lesson blares out from the results not just in the key gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey, but also in places as disparate as Minneapolis, Buffalo, N.Y., Seattle and New York City."
