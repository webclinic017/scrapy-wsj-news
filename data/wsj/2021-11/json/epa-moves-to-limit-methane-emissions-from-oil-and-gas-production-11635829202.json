    "body": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday will propose a broad expansion and strengthening of rules to limit methane emissions from oil and natural gas production, in what President Biden has deemed a critical initiative to limit one of the most potent greenhouse gases.<br />The EPA said it would for the first time propose controlling methane at existing wells nationwide, a move smaller producers have fought for years. It would put roughly one million new and existing wells under EPA methane regulation, with more stringent requirements for new wells in addition to the first-time regulations for old ones."
