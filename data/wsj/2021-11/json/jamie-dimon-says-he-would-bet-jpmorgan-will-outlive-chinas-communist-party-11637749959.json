    "body": "JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon made an offhand remark Tuesday about the American banking giant’s ability to outlast China’s Communist Party, days after he made a whirlwind trip to the Chinese financial hub of Hong Kong on a government travel exemption.<br />“I was just in Hong Kong and I made a joke that the Communist Party is celebrating its hundredth year. So is JPMorgan. I’d make you a bet we last longer,” Mr. Dimon said, according to a video recording viewed by The Wall Street Journal."
