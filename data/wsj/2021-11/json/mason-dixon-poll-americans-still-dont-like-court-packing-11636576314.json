    "body": "A large majority of Americans opposes adding justices to the Supreme Court to shift its ideological balance. A similarly large majority opposes constitutional amendments to restructure the court. That’s according to a new Mason-Dixon poll commissioned by the First Liberty Institute.<br />As if “progressives” in Washington aren’t expanding government quickly enough via the legislative process, leftist Democrats have also been seeking to restructure the federal judiciary to achieve their political ends. They even bullied President Joe Biden into naming a commission to study ways to change the Supreme Court."
