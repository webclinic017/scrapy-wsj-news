    "body": "“Voters Decide to Make America Sane Again,” writes Gerard Baker (Free Expression, Nov. 9). Usually, you win some and you lose some. But that’s not how it panned out for the reimagined, radical Democrats. The only “win some” they got was a Republican ex-Marine named Winsome Sears who became the first female, first naturalized and first woman of color to capture Virginia’s lieutenant governor position. In her victory speech, Ms. Sears socked it to the deep-blue media and the purveyors of critical race theory by reminding them that this is not 1963.<br />In Minneapolis and Seattle, the defund-the-police brigades got their comeuppance from the common folk. In New Jersey, Covid authoritarianism and Gov. Phil Murphy’s gaffe—“If you’re a one-issue voter and tax rate is your issue, we’re probably not your state” (on par with Terry McAuliffe’s “I don’t think parents should be telling schools what to teach” doozy)—nearly sent Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman who doesn’t drink from the tax-and-spend fountain, to Drumthwacket. Steve Sweeney, the Garden State’s powerful Senate president, wasn’t so lucky. He appears to have been defeated by Ed Durr, a truck driver who campaigned on a shoestring budget."
