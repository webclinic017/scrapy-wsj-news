    "body": "Now that the U.S. has left Afghanistan, it needs all the help it can get to manage the region. Meanwhile, Uzbekistan, Central Asia’s pivotal country, has dramatically changed its approach to the Taliban. That places Tashkent in a unique position to assist Washington, especially given the dearth of reliable partners.<br />The Uzbeks are able to play a key role in the efforts to deal with a post-American Afghanistan and secure broader Central Asian security. The Biden administration should find ways to enhance cooperation with President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who was elected to a second term Oct. 25."
