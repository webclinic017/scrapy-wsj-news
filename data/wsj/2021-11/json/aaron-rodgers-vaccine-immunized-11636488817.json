    "body": "The NFL assessed modest fines to the Green Bay Packers and Aaron Rodgers for violations of the league’s Covid-19 protocols in the wake of a firestorm over how the team and the league’s reigning Most Valuable Player handled his vaccination status.<br />The Packers were fined $300,000 for a handful of protocol violations while Rodgers was docked $14,650, the league said. Rodgers, facing a controversy about his comments on Covid-19 vaccinations, had returned to the radio earlier on Tuesday to partially backtrack on his stance that he hadn’t lied about being vaccinated."
