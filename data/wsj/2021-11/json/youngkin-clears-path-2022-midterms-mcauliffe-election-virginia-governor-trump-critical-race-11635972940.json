    "body": "Yes, Republican Glenn Youngkin’s victory in the Virginia governor’s race Tuesday was made possible in part by President Biden’s lousy poll numbers. Mr. Biden is at 43% approval, 51% disapproval in the RealClearPolitics average—the worst standing of any modern president at this point except Donald Trump.<br />Still, in a state Mr. Biden carried by 10 points, Gov.-elect Youngkin needed more than bad national presidential numbers. He mounted a superb campaign that Republicans running in purple or light-blue areas next year should study closely."
