    "body": "Regarding Matthew Continetti’s and Rafael Hoffman’s letters (Nov. 17) about my op-ed “Why America Needs National Conservatism” (Nov. 13): I devoted half the article to the challenge of sustaining American nationhood in the face of a concerted political assault. How can it be said, as Mr. Continetti does, that the term “national” is surplusage in “national conservatism,” with no role in my arguments?<br />The National Conservatism Conference included my talk and a few that Mr. Continetti refers to disapprovingly among around 80 others, including several by liberals and thinkers who cannot be pigeonholed. The conference organizers (I was one) aimed for a diversity of views on issues central to national conservatism. Our discussions produced important convergence on some contentious matters, such as the desirable role of religion in the public square and of tariffs in politics among nations. On other important matters, disagreements remain and are likely to continue. We regard this as a sign of health in our movement, not disarray or crisis."
