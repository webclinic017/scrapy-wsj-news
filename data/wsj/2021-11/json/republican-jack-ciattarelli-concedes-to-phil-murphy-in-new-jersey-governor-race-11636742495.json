    "body": "Republican Jack Ciattarelli conceded his electoral loss to New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday and said his campaign wouldn’t pursue a recount in the closer-than-expected contest.<br />“I hate to lose,” Mr. Ciattarelli said at a news conference. “But I’m also someone who believes strongly in our republic and our democratic processes. Enough votes have been counted. There does not appear to be a path to victory or the basis for a recount.”"
