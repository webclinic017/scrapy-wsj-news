    "body": "States are poised to get billions of dollars to provide prekindergarten classes for all 3- and 4-year-old children under a massive spending bill that would result in the largest one-time expansion of American public education in decades.<br />House Democrats are pushing to pass the roughly $2 trillion education, healthcare and climate package that is the centerpiece of President Biden’s economic agenda. The legislation is currently stalled and would likely undergo changes if it made it to the Senate. But the prekindergarten proposal has faced relatively little pushback compared with other provisions of the spending bill."
