    "body": "Your editor “The Real Biden Bill: At Least $4.6 Trillion” (Nov. 19) provides a valuable service in explaining how Congress is defrauding the public about the true cost of the Build Back Better spend-a-thon.<br />A proposal to eliminate the worst aspects of the current process: First, any entitlement programs must be included for the entire period of the analysis (in this case, 10 years). History shows that entitlements are stubborn things; once passed, they rarely go away. Include them for the entire analysis—regardless of when they are “scheduled to expire.” Second, limit any tax revenue used to “pay for” the spending to the amount that is actually imposed in the first year. Let’s use real tax increases instead of pretend ones coming in the future."
