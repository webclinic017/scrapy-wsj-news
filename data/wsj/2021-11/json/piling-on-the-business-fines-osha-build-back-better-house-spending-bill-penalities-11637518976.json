    "body": "Employers may have dodged one bullet when the Occupational Safety and Health Administration vaccine mandate was stayed by a federal appeals court. But in case they didn’t notice, the bill that passed the House on Friday is loaded with damaging fines for common and inadvertent labor violations.<br />Start with beefed-up OSHA penalties on employers for violating the agency’s workplace safety rules. Employers are subject to thousands of pages of OSHA regulations that prescribe everything from the spacing between ladder rungs to whether employees may wear wedding rings. It’s easy to get tripped up."
