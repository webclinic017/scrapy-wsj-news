    "body": "Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, the son of Libya’s slain dictator, launched a presidential campaign on Sunday in an attempt to retake control of the country more than a decade after the fall of his father’s regime in an armed rebellion.<br />Appearing for the first time in public in at least six years, Mr. Gadhafi signed the paperwork to register his candidacy in the city of Sebha in Libya’s remote southern region, television footage showed. Libya’s High National Election commission confirmed on its website that its office in Sebha had received Mr. Gadhafi’s candidacy papers."
