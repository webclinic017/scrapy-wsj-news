    "body": "As votes were being tallied in a hotly contested governor’s race, Venezuela’s Supreme Court on Monday stepped in to abruptly prohibit opposition candidate Freddy Superlano from holding office, leading to accusations that the election was being stolen.<br />The governor’s race in Barinas holds great symbolic value for the leftist regime, because it is the birthplace of the late Hugo Chávez, the populist strongman whose 1998 election as president set Venezuela on a road to Socialism. His brother Argenis Chávez has held the governorship since 2017 and has sought reelection."
