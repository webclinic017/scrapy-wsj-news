    "body": "A federal official has tossed out results from an  Amazon.com Inc.  unionization vote earlier this year for warehouse workers in Alabama, saying that the company has violated labor law in its campaign against organizing, according to the National Labor Relations Board.<br />The ruling sets the stage for a new vote in a contest that drew national attention to working conditions of warehouse employees at Amazon, the nation’s second-largest private employer. President Biden voiced his support for the workers and a number of Democratic politicians and celebrities also joined their cause."
