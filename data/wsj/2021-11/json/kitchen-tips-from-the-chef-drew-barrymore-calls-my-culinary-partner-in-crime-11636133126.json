    "body": "Three years ago, actress Drew Barrymore found herself at a crossroads. Newly divorced, at the end of her  Netflix  series “Santa Clarita Diet,” she was a Californian newly transplanted to New York, trying to get her daughter into kindergarten. As it happened, chef Pilar Valdes was at a similar transition point. After working in nonprofits for almost a decade, she had started Kickshaw Cookery, initially a membership lunch-delivery service, with a friend. When her business partner moved out of state, Ms. Valdes started thinking about the future of Kickshaw—by then also a catering company—and began working with Ms. Barrymore, first as a chef and later as a regular guest on CBS’s “The Drew Barrymore Show.”<br />"
