    "body": "WASHINGTON—Workers will be able to set aside up to $20,500 in their 401(k) accounts in 2022, up $1,000 from this year, the Internal Revenue Service said Thursday.<br />The change is part of the tax code’s annual inflation adjustments and doesn’t require Congress to act. The benefits will go to the small fraction of higher-income people who are able to max out their 401(k) contributions, setting aside more than $20,000 from their current incomes."
