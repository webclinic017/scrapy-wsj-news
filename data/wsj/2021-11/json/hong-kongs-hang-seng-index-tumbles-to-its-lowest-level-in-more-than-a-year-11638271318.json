    "body": "Hong Kong’s stock-market benchmark slid to its lowest level in nearly 14 months, as China’s regulatory crackdowns combined with investor worries about the new Omicron Covid-19 variant to push down many stocks listed in the city.<br />The Hang Seng Index dropped 1.6% on Tuesday to close at its lowest level since Oct. 2 last year, according to FactSet. The index, which is undergoing a major overhaul that will give more sway to technology stocks, fell 7.5% in November alone and has lost close to a fifth of its value over the past six months."
