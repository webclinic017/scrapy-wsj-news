    "body": "The Green Bay Packers aren’t the only 8-2 team in the National Football League, but their unique ownership structure gives them an advantage over the competition. Green Bay Packers Inc. is organized as a publicly held nonprofit corporation owned by the public, and this week it announced its sixth “stock offering” in the franchise’s history. For a league that prides itself on leveling the playing field through salary caps and reverse-order drafts, the NFL made a glaring error when it adopted a rule allowing only one team to raise capital this way.<br />This mechanism of funding has a long history. The first Packers stock sale occurred in 1923; the most recent, in 2011, helped finance development of a shopping and restaurant complex called Titletown adjacent to Lambeau Field."
