    "body": "When hundreds of lawmakers, diplomats and experts attend the annual Halifax International Security Forum this weekend, they will do so in a different—and far more dangerous—world from the one we lived in a year ago. The top challenge: China’s global ambitions and increasing belligerence toward Taiwan.<br />China is amassing military power at an alarming pace. It is increasingly obvious that the longstanding U.S. policy of “strategic ambiguity”—refusing to commit to helping Taiwan in the event of a Chinese military invasion—no longer serves our national interests. China’s strident behavior evinces a level of seriousness and a narrowing time horizon for action. If there is any hope of deterring war with China and protecting our Taiwanese friends, it is imperative that the Biden administration and Congress make American strategy clear."
