    "body": "Using electronic medical records and artificial intelligence to create algorithms for healthcare applications would be great if our electronic records were correct (“The Weekend Interview with Hassan Tetteh: How AI Will Make Your Doctor Smarter” by Allan Ripp, Nov. 6). Sadly, when carefully reviewed by patients, many records are discovered to be full of erroneous information and incorrect diagnoses.<br />Case in point: My 100-pound cousin, who has never been heavy and never had alcohol, has a medical record citing a lifelong struggle with alcoholism and obesity. My medical record contains drugs I do not take and incorrect family history. Physicians also complain about errors and problems with electronic records and efforts to get them corrected. If false information is the basis for future healthcare algorithms, we are merely compounding an already serious problem."
