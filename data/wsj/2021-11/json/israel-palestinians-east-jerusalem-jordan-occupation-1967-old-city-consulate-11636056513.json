    "body": "It is common knowledge that the Biden administration is intent on reversing President Trump’s accomplishments. Yet one must wonder what the Palestinian Authority has done to deserve so much consideration (“Blinken Seems Intent on Sparking a Crisis Over Jerusalem” by Eugene Kontorovich, op-ed, Oct. 26).<br />That Palestinian leaders demand a state of their own with its capital in Jerusalem does not create an entitlement for them to receive it. At its founding in 1964, the forerunner of the PA, the Palestine Liberation Organization, specified that it made no claims on land controlled by Egypt and Jordan. That included eastern Jerusalem. The PLO changed its charter only after Israel liberated the area in 1967, following a Jordanian attack."
