    "body": "There’s a new effort by people on the political left to explain why people keep fleeing jurisdictions dominated by the political left. An amusing series of recent media reports acknowledges that residents are leaving blue states in search of affordability, opportunity and safety. But it’s impolite in progressive media circles to acknowledge the damage wrought by heavy taxes, regulation, dysfunction and anti-police radicalism. So readers of such reports are often left to wonder why the grass is so much greener outside of places like California.<br />Now along comes a piece entitled, “Everyone’s Moving to Texas. Here’s Why.” To his credit, author Farhad Manjoo accurately describes himself as “a lefty New York Times columnist.” Readers will decide whether this disclosure gives him license to suggest repeatedly that a big part of the appeal of Texas is that it allegedly has lower climate risks than California."
