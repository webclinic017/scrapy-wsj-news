    "body": "Companies are rethinking their advertising strategies this holiday season as multiple problems, from supply-chain constraints to continued worries about Covid-19, make it harder for brands to rely on traditional festive pitches.<br />The holiday-season campaign of Cadillac, a unit of  General Motors Co. , is usually centered on its “Season’s Best Sales Event.” This year, the car maker went with “Season’s Best” instead, because it had to skip its sales events due to a shortage of cars."
