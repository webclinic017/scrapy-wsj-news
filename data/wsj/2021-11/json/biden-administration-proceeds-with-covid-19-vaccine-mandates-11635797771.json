    "body": "The Biden administration is moving ahead with mandates that workers at private-sector businesses be vaccinated against Covid-19, giving companies more details on implementation and setting the issue up for further legal challenges.<br />President Biden’s vaccine mandate for private-sector businesses with 100 or more workers—and details on how the requirement will work—will likely be released later this week, according to people familiar with the matter. The government separately on Monday released guidance on the mandate for federal contractors, which has been a factor for many large companies imposing vaccination requirements."
