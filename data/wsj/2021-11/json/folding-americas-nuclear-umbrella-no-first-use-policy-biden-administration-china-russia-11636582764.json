    "body": "The botched Afghanistan withdrawal is President Biden’s biggest foreign-policy blunder so far, but at least he can say he was following his predecessor and trends in public opinion. If Mr. Biden scales back America’s nuclear deterrent by adopting a “no first use” policy or its equivalent, the strategic damage to the U.S. may be worse and the White House will have no one else to blame.<br />The Trump Administration’s 2018 “declaratory policy” said the U.S. reserved the right to use nuclear weapons not just in response to a nuclear attack, but also in “extreme circumstances” involving “significant non-nuclear strategic attacks,” including with chemical or biological weapons. That’s consistent with U.S. policy as long as it has been a nuclear power."
