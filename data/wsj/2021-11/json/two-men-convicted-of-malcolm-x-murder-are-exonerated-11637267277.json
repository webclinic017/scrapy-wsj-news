    "body": "Two men were exonerated in the 1965 murder of Black civil rights leader Malcolm X after a judge vacated their convictions at the request of the Manhattan district attorney.<br />New York State Supreme Court Judge Ellen Biben tossed the convictions of Muhammad A. Aziz and Khalil Islam during a hearing Thursday after District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said a new investigation had unearthed evidence of the menâ€™s innocence. The probe found that the New York Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation had suppressed exculpatory evidence, Mr. Vance said."
