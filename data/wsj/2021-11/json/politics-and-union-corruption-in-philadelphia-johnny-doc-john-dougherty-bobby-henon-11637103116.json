    "body": "Unions and politicians enjoy a symbiotic relationship in America’s big cities. And in Philadelphia on Monday a jury found that a powerful labor boss and city councilman crossed over into public corruption.<br />John Dougherty, known as Johnny Doc, has long run the powerful International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 98, and in recent years he also headed Philadelphia’s Building and Construction Trades Council. Prosecutors found that he kept City Councilman Bobby Henon on the Local 98 payroll for a no-show job and paid him health and pension benefits. In exchange Mr. Henon did Johnny Doc’s bidding, political or personal."
