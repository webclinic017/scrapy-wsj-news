    "body": "The newly passed infrastructure bill is a rare feat of bipartisan cooperation that President Biden and Congress should celebrate. From roads to waterways to power lines and more, the plan is poised to rebuild a nation in need of huge repairs. Once Mr. Biden signs the bill into law, the true work of fixing our infrastructure will begin.<br />But there is a danger. The bill could easily lead to out-of-control costs, blown deadlines, and both real and metaphorical bridges to nowhere. The Biden administration needs to coordinate efforts among federal, state and local agencies to deliver on the promise of this bill."
