    "body": "MOSCOW—Russian authorities opened a criminal investigation into a suspected methane-gas explosion at a Siberian coal mine that killed more than 50 people and left dozens hospitalized, casting a spotlight on a key industry for the country that in recent years has been plagued with accidents.<br />The exact circumstances of Thursday’s explosion at the Listvyazhnaya mine, in the Kemerovo region of southwestern Siberia, are still being investigated. But preliminary assessments found that toxic fumes began to fill the ventilation point in the mine some 820 feet underground and the workers were suffocated, investigators said."
