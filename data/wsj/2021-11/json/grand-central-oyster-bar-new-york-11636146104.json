    "body": "For the Time Capsule series, we spotlight a cherished restaurant, hotel or landmark that’s changed remarkably little over the years. This week, we visit Grand Central Oyster Bar in New York.<br />WHEN IT opened in 1913, as the main dining room for the city’s new Beaux-Arts transportation hub, what we know today as the Grand Central Oyster Bar was baldly dubbed the Grand Central Terminal Restaurant. Its name was the only prosaic thing about it. Persian carpets covered the floors, cane-backed chairs stood at tables draped in white linen, and a ceiling of vaulted canopies inlaid with sand-hued tiles glistened above electric chandeliers. The sprawling subterranean space dazzled diners arriving or leaving on the Wolverine, the 20th Century Limited and hundreds of other trains that chugged in and out of Grand Central every day. Over the decades the Persian rugs were tossed, the white linen gave way to red-and-white checks and diners sat elbow-to-elbow at counters that displaced many of the tables. Well into the 1960s, deals were sealed in the clubby (and quieter) adjoining Saloon, over lunches of dry martinis and silken oyster pan roasts. But by the early 70s, rail travel was in rapid decline, and the Oyster Bar along with it: The ceiling tiles were darkened from time and neglect, aqua contact paper covered the marble pillar bases, and plastic fish festooned fishing nets that hung from the ceiling. On the last day of July 1974, the Oyster Bar closed. Later that year, restaurateur Jerome Brody takes the helm and the restaurant reopens."
