    "body": "Barbados officially became a republic on Tuesday, ending almost four centuries of ties to the British monarchy in a midnight ceremony attended by Prince Charles.<br />The small Caribbean island, sometimes called “Little England,” became the first nation in nearly 30 years to sever its ties to the monarchy, after Mauritius became a republic in 1992. Queen Elizabeth II is still the sovereign over 15 independent nations, among them Canada, Australia and Jamaica."
