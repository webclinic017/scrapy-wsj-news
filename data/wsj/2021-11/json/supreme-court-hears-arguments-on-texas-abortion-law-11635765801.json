    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Monday will take up a Texas ban on most abortions, hearing oral arguments on a novel law that has survived legal challenges so far despite being at odds with constitutional protections for abortion rights.<br />The litigation is moving at a speed hardly ever reached at the high court, which prefers to move at a slow and steady pace. Just 10 days ago the justices said they would step in to address thorny legal questions raised by the law, which has tested the normal mechanisms of judicial review and sent Texas women seeking abortions beyond six weeks of pregnancy scrambling for procedures in nearby states."
