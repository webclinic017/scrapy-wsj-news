    "body": "The Boy Scouts of America’s push to settle sex-abuse claims from 82,200 men has touched off lobbying campaigns by plaintiffs’ lawyers who disagree on whether victims should back a compensation plan that could be the organization’s ticket out of bankruptcy.<br />Abuse victims across the country are debating whether the $1.9 billion settlement offer is fair compensation for lives affected by childhood trauma, as lawyers on different sides of the issue have given conflicting information on what they can expect to receive. One group of lawyers told victims they could receive as much as $2.7 million for the worst abuses, while another estimated the highest payout would be no more than $58,000."
