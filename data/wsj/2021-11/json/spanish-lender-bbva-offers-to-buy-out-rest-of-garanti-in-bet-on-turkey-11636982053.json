    "body": "International lender  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA   plans to double down on its presence in Turkey, in a rare boost for the country’s beleaguered financial system.<br />BBVA, Spain’s second-largest lender by assets, offered Monday to buy out the 50.2% of a Turkish bank,  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S. ,  that it doesn’t already own. The $2.6 billion bid comes as Turkey faces punishing inflation, a sliding currency and diminished confidence in President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s unorthodox economic management."
