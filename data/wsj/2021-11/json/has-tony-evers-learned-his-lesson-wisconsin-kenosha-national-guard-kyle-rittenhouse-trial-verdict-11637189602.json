    "body": "Prosecutors say Kyle Rittenhouse’s conduct at a riot in Kenosha, Wis., on Aug. 25, 2020 was “criminally reckless,” and we’ll soon find out whether jurors agree. But no jury is needed to decide whether it was morally and politically reckless for public officials and the press to condone vicious rioting in Kenosha and other cities last summer. That created the vacuum in which the Rittenhouse shootings took place.<br />Perhaps the state’s Democratic Governor, Tony Evers, has learned from that debacle. To forestall another round of violence in the city after the Rittenhouse verdict, Mr. Evers has put 500 National Guard troops on active duty. He tweeted that “regardless of the outcome of this case, I urge peace in Kenosha and across our state.” In his statement deploying the National Guard, he reiterated that protesters should exercise their First Amendment rights “safely and peacefully.”"
