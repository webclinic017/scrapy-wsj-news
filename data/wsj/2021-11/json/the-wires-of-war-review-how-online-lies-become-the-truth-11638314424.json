    "body": "The scam runs something like this: You start with what’s known as “placement.” “Some untruth is cooked up,” Jacob Helberg tells us. “The disinformation can be completely fabricated” or “it may originate with hacked or compromising information.” Next comes “amplification,” using shells or false online identities to disseminate that cooked-up untruth. From there one proceeds to “layering,” in which intermediaries “obscure the original source of disinformation and spread propaganda far and wide.” The coup de grâce arrives with “integration,” the point at which the lie has been so widely propagated that it becomes accepted as truth.<br />Mr. Helberg here isn’t describing the process by which theSteele dossier, concerning Donald Trump’s alleged Russia collusion, deranged American politics for five years. Instead, the author’s purpose in “The Wires of War: Technology and the Global Struggle for Power” is to explain how Russia and China, among others, seek to wage digital war on America and its allies."
