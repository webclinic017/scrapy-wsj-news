    "body": "China began selling euro-denominated government bonds, weeks after it raised $4 billion in dollar debt at cheap rates despite slowing economic growth.<br />The sale is likely to total about €4 billion, the equivalent of $4.6 billion, a term sheet showed on Wednesday—the same size as a similar bond deal last November, in which China capitalized on Europe’s superlow interest rates to sell its first negative-yielding debt."
