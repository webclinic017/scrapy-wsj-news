    "body": "WASHINGTON—Former President Donald Trump’s last White House chief of staff agreed to speak to a Democratic-led House committee investigating the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol Tuesday as a federal appeals court grappled with the novel legal question of whether Mr. Trump could stop disclosure of some of his presidential papers to the committee.<br />Mark Meadows, who had initially resisted cooperating with the investigation, has produced records to the select committee and will soon appear for an initial deposition, according to a statement by its chairman, Bennie Thompson (D., Miss.). “The committee will continue to assess his degree of compliance with our subpoena after the deposition,” Mr. Thompson said."
