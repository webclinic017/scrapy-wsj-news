    "body": "Lawyers for Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager who shot and killed two people during unrest in Kenosha, Wis., last year, have made a new motion for a mistrial over a video they say was transferred to them by the prosecution at a lower resolution than what was available to the state.<br />The motion for a mistrial without prejudice—which if granted would allow for a retrial of the teenager—came during the jury’s second day of deliberations."
