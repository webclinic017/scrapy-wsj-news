    "body": "Four years ago, at a choral festival in Utrecht in the Netherlands, I listened to all 150 of the Psalms sung by a series of great choirs. The words were displayed in Dutch and English over the stage, and the music that the Psalms were set to went from early medieval times to the modern day. The experience was cathartic for everyone. You could see it in the tears in people’s eyes, in their recognition that something vital was being communicated to them.<br />The impact of the Psalms raised the question why religious texts, so full of faith in God’s righteousness and mercy, should touch a person like me, who’s not much of a believer. Here were people obviously feeling the deep impact of words crafted to celebrate the glory of a God that many of them did not believe in."
