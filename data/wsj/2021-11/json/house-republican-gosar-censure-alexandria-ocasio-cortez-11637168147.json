    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The Democrat-controlled House voted 223-207 Wednesday to censure GOP Rep. Paul Gosar and remove him from his committee assignments over an animated video he posted last week that showed him killing Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and poised to attack President Biden.<br />The move is a formal repudiation of the Arizona lawmaker and marks the first successful censure since former Rep. Charlie Rangel (D., N.Y.) was censured in 2010. Mr. Gosar had to listen to the pronouncement from the well of the House after the vote."
