    "body": "At the beginning of the 1921 school year, Pearl Pugsley of Knobel, Ark., was sent home from high school for wearing lipstick and powder. Not only were her parents understanding about her adolescent infraction, they retained a lawyer on her behalf, arguing that their daughter’s civil rights had been violated. The case received nationwide press coverage, and at the height of Pearl’s fame, her mother said, she was offered $1,000 a week by a “Los Angeles motion picture concern [that] wants ‘the heroine of the lipstick war.’”<br />America’s lipstick war is little remembered today, but a century ago, the debate over whether respectable women could wear lipstick had important political and social implications. For Pearl herself, wearing lipstick was about more than vanity—there was a principle at stake. “It wasn’t a desire to create trouble when the suit was filed,” she explained at the time. “I’m going to fight the case to a finish in an effort to uphold women’s rights to use all reasonable means to look their best at all times.”"
