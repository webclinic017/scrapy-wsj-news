    "body": "HONG KONG—A former food deliveryman who chanted protest slogans in this city’s shopping malls after China imposed a national security law was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison after being found guilty of promoting independence, a sentence that establishes tough penalties for public dissent.<br />Ma Chun-man, a 30-year-old who often appeared at flash protests carrying a Captain America shield, is the second person to be sentenced under the city’s national security law which took effect in June 2020. He is also the first to be sentenced solely for nonviolent acts. He was found guilty of inciting secession by a judge who was handpicked by Carrie Lam, the city’s leader."
