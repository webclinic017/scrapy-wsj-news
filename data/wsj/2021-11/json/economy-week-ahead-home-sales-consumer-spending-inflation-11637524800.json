    "body": "Reports on U.S. consumer spending and inflation highlight this holiday-shortened week. Outside of regular data, markets are also waiting for President Biden to announce his nomination for Federal Reserve chairmanâ€”a decision is expected this week.<br />U.S. existing-home sales are estimated to have fallen slightly to an annual pace of 6.2 million in October. The drop-off, if realized, would likely be some payback after a big gain in September, as well as a reflection of high and rising prices that have locked many first-time buyers out of the market."
