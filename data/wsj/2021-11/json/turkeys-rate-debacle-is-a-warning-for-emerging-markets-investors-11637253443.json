    "body": "When central banks in the West behave chaotically, those in developing countries have even less room to mess around. Turkey doesn’t seem to have gotten the memo.<br />On Thursday, the Turkish lira fell 2% against the U.S. dollar after Turkey’s central bank lowered interest rates for a third time in a row. The lira has plummeted 30% since the start of the year, losing all the stability gained under the tenure of the previous central-bank governor, who was succeeded in March."
