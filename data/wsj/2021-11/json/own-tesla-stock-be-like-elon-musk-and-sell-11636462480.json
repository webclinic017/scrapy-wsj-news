    "body": "Did Elon Musk outsource the decision of whether to sell Tesla stock to his  Twitter  followers because he’s a wacky billionaire who is angry about Democratic tax plans? Or is it because he knows more about Tesla’s true value than anyone else, and thinks now’s the time to get out?<br />Either way, it’s a good time to sell as the three trends that helped Tesla shares soar are fickle and might reverse at any time."
