    "body": "El Salvador is planning to issue next year $1 billion in bonds backed by bitcoin, the latest effort by the economically stressed Central American nation to attract crypto capital.<br />The country this year became the first to adopt bitcoin as a national currency. It plans to sell $1 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated 10-year bonds with a coupon of 6.5%. Half of that money would be used to buy bitcoin to hold for five years and the rest would fund construction projects related to bitcoin."
