    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court rejected Mississippi’s claim that the city of Memphis, Tenn., was stealing its water, ruling unanimously Monday that the massive aquifer at issue was subject to distribution among several states the same way aboveground resources such as rivers, groundwater and migratory fish are divided.<br />Mississippi v. Tennessee was the first case argued in the court’s current term, which began Oct. 4, and the first opinion delivered in an argued case. The court gave no immediate indication when it might act on other outstanding matters. Those include the fate of the nation’s most restrictive abortion law currently in effect—a Texas measure outlawing the procedure for women more than about six weeks pregnant—which the court took up on an expedited schedule."
