    "body": "GLASGOW—Leaders from more than 100 nations kicked off COP26 climate talks here, confronting still-large gaps over how to slash emissions quickly enough to avoid the most destructive effects of global warming.<br />The United Nations summit opened Monday, a day after leaders of the Group of 20 major economies made little progress over the weekend hammering out specific climate goals many had hoped would ease discussions in Scotland. Leaders reached a deal to end financing of coal-burning power plants overseas that aren’t equipped with technology to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions. But they didn’t agree on targets for phasing out fossil fuel subsidies or their dependence on coal, one of the biggest sources of carbon-dioxide emissions."
