    "body": "As video coach Brad Aldrich negotiated his exit from the Chicago Blackhawks in 2010, he made a request of the team’s human-resources department: Could he take the team’s newly won Stanley Cup to his hometown for a day?<br />The team agreed to let Aldrich participate in the tradition that allows every person from a Cup-winning club to have a day with the trophy. Aldrich’s name was also inscribed on the Cup alongside hundreds of others who are associated with title teams. He received a severance, playoff bonus and championship ring."
