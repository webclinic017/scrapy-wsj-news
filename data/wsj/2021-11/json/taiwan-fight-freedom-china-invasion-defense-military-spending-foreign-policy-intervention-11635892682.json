    "body": "Regarding “Is Taiwan’s Military Ready For War? Few Think So” (Page One, Oct. 26): Taiwan appears unwilling to properly invest in and organize for its own defense. In that event, why should the U.S. be willing to sacrifice its blood and treasure to defend Taiwan? Why should the U.S. care more about defending an ally militarily than the ally does? If our ally won’t do its best to prepare for its own defense, we may well be facing another Afghanistan-style fiasco in the event of war.<br />Gil Ehrenkranz"
