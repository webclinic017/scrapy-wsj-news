    "body": "TEL AVIV—A member of the Palestinian militant group Hamas fatally shot one Israeli and injured four others near one of Jerusalem’s holiest sites on Sunday, according to Israeli police, who shot dead the assailant and boosted security in the city on concerns over a flare-up in violence.<br />The gunman, a 42-year-old religious teacher dressed in a long black robe, opened fire near Jerusalem’s Chain Gate, a key point of access to the contested religious site known as the Temple Mount to Jews and the Noble Sanctuary for Muslims. Of the survivors, two civilians were injured—one moderately and one who is still in serious condition—and two police officers were lightly wounded, Israeli police said. The dead civilian was identified by Israeli police as 26-year-old Eliyahu David Kay, a recent immigrant from South Africa who worked in the Old City of Jerusalem."
