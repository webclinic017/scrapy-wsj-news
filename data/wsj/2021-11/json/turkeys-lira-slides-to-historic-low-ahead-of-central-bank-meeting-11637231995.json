    "body": "ISTANBUL—Turkey’s currency sank to a historic low against the dollar on Thursday as investors fled the lira in anticipation of a central-bank decision to cut interest rates demanded by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.<br />The lira dropped to 10.97 against the dollar early Thursday morning before rebounding to 10.66. The currency has lost nearly 8% of its value since Monday as Mr. Erdogan reiterated a demand for lower interest rates as a part of his unorthodox strategy to spur economic growth."
