    "body": "A diplomatic crisis between France and Australia deepened on Wednesday after senior officials on both sides traded barbs over September’s landmark defense agreement between the U.S. and Australia, as geopolitical tensions over the accord continued to ripple.<br />Relations between the two nations have deteriorated since the U.S., U.K. and Australia announced a security pact under which Australia would receive submarine nuclear-propulsion technology, a deal that resulted in France losing a $65 billion contract to supply submarines to Australia. The episode prompted France to recall its ambassadors to both Canberra and Washington."
