    "body": "Americans like to be first—in Olympic gold medals, for example—but maybe not in this category: If the $4 trillion House spending bill passes, the U.S. will have the highest combined federal and state personal income tax rate in the developed world.<br />The Tax Foundation recently comparedthe combined tax rates on individual income at all levels of government across major nations. Today the U.S. is in the middle of the pack with a still very high top rate on income of 42.9%, including federal and average state tax rates. That’s a little above the current Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development average of 42.6%."
