    "body": "American Airlines Group Inc.<br />A new Covid variant is causing fresh turbulence for airlines. Governments across Europe and Asia slapped new restrictions on flights and travelers from a swath of southern Africa, acting to stem the transmission of a Covid-19 variant identified in the region. Global airline shares fell sharply Friday amid worry that the variant could lead to broader travel bans, just as many parts of the world were starting to fly again.  American Airlines  shares fell 8.8% Friday."
