    "body": "WASHINGTON—Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper is suing the Pentagon for redacting portions of his coming book, making him the highest ranking member of the Trump administration to fight government officials’ attempts to restrict sensitive information in their memoirs.<br />“The American people deserve a full and unvarnished accounting of our nation’s history,” Mr. Esper said in a statement. His book, “A Sacred Oath,” includes “important details and new insights” into some of the most controversial events that occurred during the Trump administration, Mr. Esper said. The book is scheduled to be published by William Morrow."
