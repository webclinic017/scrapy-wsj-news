    "body": "U.S. online sales were up slightly during the early hours of Cyber Monday, although analysts expect digital sales to be flat for the day as smaller discounts gave shoppers less incentive to spend.<br />Shoppers spent $4 billion online through noon eastern time in the U.S., up 8% from the same period last year, according to shopping data compiled by  Salesforce.com Inc.
