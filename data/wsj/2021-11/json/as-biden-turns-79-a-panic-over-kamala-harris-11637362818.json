    "body": "President Biden’s 79th birthday Saturday is the key to understanding the Democratic alarms this week about Vice President Kamala Harris. Is her approval rating as terrible as the surveys say? Is she being unfairly sidelined by the White House? That fretting is really about Joe and 2024.<br />Democrats are slowly figuring out that Mr. Biden is unlikely to seek a second term, especially as voters conclude by watching him that he’s struggling under the burdens of the job. During the 2020 campaign, questioning his pep was treated as taboo ageism, despite the obvious change in his vigor compared with his 2012 debate against Paul Ryan."
