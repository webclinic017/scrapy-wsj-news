    "body": "How’s this for a self-imposed foreign-policy setback: America’s most important ally in the most important theater of world politics has been without a Senate-confirmed U.S. ambassador for more than two years. The Foreign Relations Committee finally approved former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s nomination to be U.S. ambassador to Japan last week, but he awaits a vote on the floor.<br />The last American ambassador to Japan, Bill Hagerty, was confirmed in July 2017, and the Trump Administration strengthened ties with Tokyo as competition with China intensified. Mr. Hagerty left the post in summer 2019 to run for U.S. Senate in Tennessee, and President Trump’s 2020 nominee to replace him didn’t get a Senate vote before the November election."
