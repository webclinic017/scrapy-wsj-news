    "body": "Wading through the swamp made my prosthetic leg chafe, but I gritted through the discomfort. It was this past July, and I was leading a team of 11 students and scientists through a steamy nature preserve in southwest Georgia to hunt for plants. The muck was thick, but the swamp was beautiful: Knobby-kneed cypress trees stood like wizened sentries over clusters of lush green ferns.<br />My team moved in unison to clip bits of plants, press them into sheets of paper and stuff them into large collection bags. Later, in my research lab at Emory University, we would test their chemical compounds against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The possibility of developing new drugs from elements of nature such as our leaf clippings is important for everyone, but itâ€™s personal for me; after losing my leg as a child, I nearly died as a result of postsurgical infection."
