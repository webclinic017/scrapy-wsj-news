    "body": "LONDON— BP  PLC benefited from resurgent oil prices in the third quarter and said it would buy back more shares, though the energy giant’s profit was wiped out by an accounting issue.<br />The London-listed company said Tuesday that beyond higher commodity prices, its results were boosted by gains in its refining business and in natural-gas trading, and that it would use some of its surplus cash to buy back $1.25 billion of stock in the coming months."
