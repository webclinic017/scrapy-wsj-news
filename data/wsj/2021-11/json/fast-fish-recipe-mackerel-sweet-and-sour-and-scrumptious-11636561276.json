    "body": "“IT’S AMAZING what a splash of vinegar will do for an oily fish. “This is a British version of fish en escabeche, sweet and sour,” said chef Tomos Parry of his third Slow Food Fast recipe, for grilled mackerel with “soused” vegetables.<br />First, Mr. Parry simmers root vegetables in a light pickling liquid made with fish stock, vinegar, olive oil, coriander, orange peel and a little honey. As the veggies soften, he gives the mackerel a quick sear to crisp its skin. Finally, the fish goes into the pan with the vegetables just to cook through."
