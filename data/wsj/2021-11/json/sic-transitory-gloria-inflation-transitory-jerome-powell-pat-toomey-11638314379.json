    "body": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell finally jettisoned the word “transitory” to describe today’s inflation, and we suppose it’s better late than never. Asked by Sen. Pat Toomey on Tuesday how long inflation would have to persist before the Fed no longer considers it to be transitory, Mr. Powell abandoned the word.<br />The chairman acknowledged that inflation has long since gone beyond the central bank’s 2% target. He then said that some people define transitory to mean “short-lived.” But at the Fed “we tend to use it to mean that it won’t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation.” He added that perhaps it’s time for the Fed to “retire” the word and “try to explain more clearly what we mean.”"
