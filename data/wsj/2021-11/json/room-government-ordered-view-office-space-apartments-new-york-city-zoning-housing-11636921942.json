    "body": "There is an estimated 87.5 million square feet of vacant office space in New York City. Almost 20% of the Big Appleâ€™s commercial property sits empty because of functional obsolescence and the rise of remote work. At the same time, the city faces a serious housing crisis. A simple solution would be to start converting vacant office space into apartments.<br />Adaptive reuse would increase the supply of homes in transit-rich locations already built for density, without encroaching on historic residential enclaves. It would breathe life back into neighborhoods whose small businesses and restaurants are reeling from the pandemic. Recycling obsolete office buildings is also great for the environment. The construction is far greener, and it should also reduce carbon emissions because so many of the best candidates for conversion can be occupied by people who walk to work."
