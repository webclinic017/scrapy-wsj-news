    "body": "In the premiere episode of  Amazon  Prime’s new animated show “Fairfax,” a group of clout-hungry teenagers attempts to track down a limited-edition T-shirt from Latrine, a fictional streetwear brand that is a thinly veiled sendup of Supreme. The show is overstuffed with knowing references to hype-happy streetwear in the real world: The animated quartet name-drops Grailed, a resale site; the characters lust after decade-plus-old Nike Dunks; and the shirt they’re after carries Dr. Phil’s face, a nod to head-scratcher Supreme collaborations which featured images of Kermit the Frog or Shrek.<br />In the mold of long-running cartoons like “The Simpsons,” “South Park” and  Netflix ’s  recently finished “BoJack Horseman,” “Fairfax” is an animated show for adults that lampoons American culture. (Peppered with f-bombs, this is not a show to watch with your tween.) Whereas “BoJack Horseman” sunk its teeth into Hollywood, “Fairfax” takes aim at social-media addiction and the rabid fashion consumerism. (One of the executive producers of “Fairfax” worked on “BoJack.”)"
