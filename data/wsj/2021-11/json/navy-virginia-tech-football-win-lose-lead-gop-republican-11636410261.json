    "body": "The crux of Gerard Baker’s “The GOP Has a Chance at More Than Election Victory” (Free Expression, Oct. 26) echoes something I often preach to my students, junior officers in the U.S. Navy. Early on, I tell them: “Don’t approach this course like Navy plays football. Navy doesn’t play to win, it plays not to lose; and as a result, it loses.” A similar lesson can be gleaned from my wife’s alma mater. It seems that whenever Virginia Tech gets a 14-point lead, it stops driving and tries to sit on it until the clock runs out. Often, the clock doesn’t run out soon enough. The GOP cannot rely on the Democrats to lose the next election. It needs to articulate and assert its values and goals until the election is won.<br />J.C. Snead"
