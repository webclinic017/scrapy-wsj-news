    "body": "In “Readers Respond: Knock It Off, Mr. President” (Oct. 30), a letter writer asserts that the Journal should not have printed President Trump’s letter because it is full of untruths. But how does she know this? No doubt from hearing from different sources and coming to her own conclusions.<br />Unfortunately, rather than let others do the same thing, she feels censorship of Mr. Trump is necessary. Perhaps she thinks the rest of the electorate needs to be shielded from the debate because others aren’t capable of coming to the right conclusions."
