    "body": "Give Marriott its due. When news broke that one of its hotels in Prague turned away customers who wanted to host a conference on the Uighurs, it apologized.<br />In a statement Thursday, the company said “the management team at the hotel has contacted the group to apologize.” The refusal, it said, “was not consistent” with Marriott’s policy of “welcoming people from all around the world and from all walks of life representing many beliefs.”"
