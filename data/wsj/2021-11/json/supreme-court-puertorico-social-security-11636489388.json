    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The Supreme Court grappled Tuesday with whether the Constitution lets Congress deny certain benefits for the poor and disabled to residents of Puerto Rico, support that is routinely given to citizens living within the U.S. 50 states.<br />The case centered on the Supplemental Security Income program, administered by the Social Security Administration, which provides assistance to low-income Americans who are older than 65 years, blind or disabled. Congress created the program in 1972 and it initially applied to residents of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Lawmakers later extended the program to the Northern Mariana Islands but not to Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories."
