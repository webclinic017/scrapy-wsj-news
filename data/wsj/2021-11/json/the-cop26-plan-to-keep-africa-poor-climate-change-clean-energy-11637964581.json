    "body": "As a Senegalese entrepreneur, I can tell you what’s holding Africa back: lack of affordable energy. We live on a continent where the average annual income is less than $2,000, and the majority of people rely on fossil fuels for survival. The climate goals wealthy nations demanded at the recent COP26 summit aren’t only absurd, they are a death sentence for Africans.<br />In recent decades, China’s citizens have moved from poor to middle class. India has improved the situation of the poor with a booming high-tech industry. Africa remains stuck at the bottom of almost every developmental index. More than 7% of children in sub-Saharan Africa die before they turn 5. Immediate implementation of the environmental concerns of developed nations isn’t Africa’s most urgent priority."
