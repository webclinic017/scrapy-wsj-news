    "body": "High inflation should no longer be surprising, nor should it be labeled “transitory.” Its existence should prompt serious reflection on policy decisions and spur action to avoid a financial crisis.<br />The big issue is financial stability. Inflation hasn’t been this high relative to Treasury bond yields since the 1970s. Then as now, real bond yields—the gap between the 10-year Treasury and inflation—signaled distress for policy makers and market participants."
