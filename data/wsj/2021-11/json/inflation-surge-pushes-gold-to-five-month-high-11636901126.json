    "body": "A three-decade high in inflation has broken gold from its long 2021 rut, a sign investors are seeking greater protection from the prospect of lingering consumer-price increases.<br />Most-actively-traded gold futures just notched their best week in six months, rising 2.9% to $1,868.50 a troy ounce after data showed persistent supply shortages and strong consumer demand lifting prices at the fastest 12-month pace since 1990. That data spurred bets that inflation could linger longer than Federal Reserve officials expect, driving gains in assets including Treasury inflation-protected securities and gold."
