    "body": "The depiction of Brazil in “Democracy Loses Favor Across Latin America” (Page One, Nov. 10) constitutes a grave distortion of the situation in my country. Brazil is one of the world’s largest and most vibrant democracies and a force for good in addressing crucial global challenges, such as environmental protection, sustainable growth and food security. A vigorous public debate prevails in Brazil within an institutional framework defined by its federal constitution.<br />Under President Jair Bolsonaro, the Brazilian government has assumed a renewed commitment—one at the heart of our almost 200-year partnership with the U.S.—to support human rights, democracy and economic freedom in the hemisphere and beyond. We have lived up to that commitment by our actions, including by welcoming 265,000 Venezuelans who fled Nicolás Maduro’s dictatorship."
