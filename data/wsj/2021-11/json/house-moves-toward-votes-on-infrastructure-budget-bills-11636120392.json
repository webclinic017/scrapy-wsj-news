    "body": "WASHINGTON—Top House Democrats moved to bring up a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill for a vote Friday, abandoning a longstanding arrangement with progressives to first pass a separate education, healthcare and climate package as the party still struggled to unify around that proposal.<br />The scheduled vote on the public works legislation, which passed the Senate earlier this summer with broad bipartisan support, would be followed by an initial procedural vote on the roughly $2 trillion social-spending plan. Leaders didn’t schedule a vote on the social-spending plan itself."
