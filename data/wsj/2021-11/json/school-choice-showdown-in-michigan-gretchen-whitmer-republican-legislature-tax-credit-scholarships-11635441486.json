    "body": "This has been a banner year for school choice across much of the U.S., and Michigan is the latest state to advance the cause. The GOP-led Legislature last week passed choice legislation that will force Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to choose between students and teachers unions.<br />Bills passed by the state House and Senate create tax-credit scholarships of as much as roughly $7,800 per student. The funds could be used for private-school tuition, tutoring expenses, transportation and more."
