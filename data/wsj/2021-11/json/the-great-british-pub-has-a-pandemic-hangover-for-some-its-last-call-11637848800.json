    "body": "LIVERPOOL, England—Conor Foley’s pub, Kelly’s Dispensary, offers a bar-stool view of forces roiling the global economy.

The U.K. lost around 3,250 pubs and bars—about 6.8% of all such businesses—between March 2020 and September this year, according to consultants AlixPartners and CGA, as the pandemic added to the strain on these drinking establishments, considered classic cultural institutions."
