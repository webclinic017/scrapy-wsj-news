    "body": "GLASGOW—The surprise announcement that the U.S. and China would cooperate on accelerating a transition to cleaner energy came after both President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping encouraged their delegates to find common ground ahead of a virtual summit, according to people familiar with the negotiation.<br />The announcement came as the global COP26 climate conference entered its final days, with delegates eager to show progress in the fight against global warming. Many see commitments from Messrs. Biden and Xi, leaders of the world’s two largest economies and largest greenhouse-gas emitters, as necessary to get other nations to consent to common and more aggressive goals in closing agreements."
