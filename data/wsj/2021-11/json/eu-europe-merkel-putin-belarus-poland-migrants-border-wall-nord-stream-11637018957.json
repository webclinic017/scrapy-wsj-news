    "body": "It is gratifying that the European Union did not see Poland’s blocking of the refugee offensive on its borders as another example of the nation’s alleged slide into authoritarianism (“Putin’s Belarus Offensive,” Review & Outlook, Nov. 12).<br />Perhaps Angela Merkel’s lingering pain from her error, in allowing uncontrolled refugee movement into Germany, has convinced her successors that a nation’s control of its borders is necessary, after all. Perhaps also the EU’s decision to finance Poland and other Baltic states in building physical barriers to confront Vladimir Putin’s stereogram was influenced by a lesson from across the pond. Perhaps the threat of “shutting off natural gas” from Mr. Putin’s puppet in Belarus should be seen by the Germans as an indication of coming attractions when the Nord Stream 2 pipeline takes hold."
