    "body": "Alex Murdaugh, the disgraced South Carolina lawyer who is facing charges of swindling his late housekeeper’s sons out of millions of dollars in an insurance settlement, has been indicted on new financial-crimes charges.A South Carolina grand jury issued five indictments, totaling 27 counts, that include breach of trust with fraudulent intent, obtaining signature or property by false pretenses, money laundering, computer crimes and forgery, Attorney General Alan Wilson said Friday.“Altogether, Murdaugh is charged with respect to alleged schemes to defraud victims and thereafter launder $4,853,488.09,” the attorney general said.<br />Mr. Murdaugh, the 53-year-old scion of one of South Carolina’s most powerful families, is at the center of a quickly unraveling saga that involves five fatalities, at least seven state and federal investigations and millions of dollars unaccounted for. The most significant chunk of that missing money is from a $4.3 million wrongful-death settlement meant for the sons of Gloria Satterfield, the Murdaugh housekeeper and nanny for more than 20 years."
