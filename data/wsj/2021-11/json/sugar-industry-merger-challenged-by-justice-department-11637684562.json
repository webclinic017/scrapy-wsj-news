    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit challenging U.S. Sugar’s proposed purchase of rival Imperial Sugar, arguing the tie-up would lead to higher prices for refined sugar and food-and-beverage staples for consumers.<br />The suit, filed Tuesday in a Delaware federal court, is the fourth major deal challenge in recent months from the department, which has been following through on a Biden-era enforcement pledge to take a harder line against industry consolidation."
