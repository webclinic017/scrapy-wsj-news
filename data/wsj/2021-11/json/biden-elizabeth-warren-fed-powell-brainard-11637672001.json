    "body": "WASHINGTON—Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s opposition to President Biden’s renomination of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell marks her most public break with her one-time presidential rival, whose economic policy and personnel choices she has helped shape.<br />Ms. Warren said Monday that she would vote against Mr. Powell’s nomination for a second term as Fed chairman, a move that was widely expected after she assailed Mr. Powell in September as a “dangerous man” who would weaken banking rules. She announced her support for Fed governor Lael Brainard, who was nominated to serve as Fed vice chairwoman."
