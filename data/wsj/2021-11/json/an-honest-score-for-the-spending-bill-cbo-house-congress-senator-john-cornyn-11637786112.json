    "body": "We’ve told you about the gimmicks Democrats are using to disguise the true cost of their tax and spending bill, and now a GOP Senator wants the Congressional Budget Office to give an honest cost estimate: “The American people deserve more than smoke-and-mirror accounting from Washington, D.C.”<br />That’s Texas Sen. John Cornyn in a letter this week to the heads of CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation. Both outfits recently released scores for the tax and spending bill Democrats passed through the House. CBO found that the bill would increase the budget deficit even if taken at face value, spending $1.6 trillion while raising only $1.3 trillion. CBO isn’t lying but it is constrained by the scoring rules Congress imposes, which include pretending that programs end even if they never will."
