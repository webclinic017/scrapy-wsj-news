    "body": "A financial planner would have told Elon Musk to take some of his Tesla chips off the table long ago. But Mr. Musk had an additional reason for his weekend stunt, putting up for a  Twitter  vote whether he should liquidate 10% of his stake in the stupendously valuable electric-vehicle maker.<br />In the coming months, he would likely have to sell a large chunk anyway to pay the resulting taxes on a load of expiring options. His only alternative, presumably, would be to take out a big loan against his shares, but this would subject him to potentially ruinous margin calls if (when?) Tesla were to plummet to a more realistic valuation."
