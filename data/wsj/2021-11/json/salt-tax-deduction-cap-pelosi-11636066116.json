    "body": "Don’t Democrats want to raise taxes on the rich? We seem to recall this—correct us if we’re wrong—but then how are they going to explain their expansion of the state-and-local tax deduction for largely affluent taxpayers in mainly Democratic states?<br />We realize that last point answers the question. This is a giant political payoff to House Democrats from New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California so they vote for the Sanders-Pelosi $4 trillion tax and spending bill. As a raw exercise in political and economic hypocrisy, this is one for the ages."
