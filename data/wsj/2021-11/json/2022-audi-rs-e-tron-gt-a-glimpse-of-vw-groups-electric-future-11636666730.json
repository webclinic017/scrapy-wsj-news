    "body": "FOR A BRIEF TIME and to the dismay of the patrons, I was once a chef at a resort hotel, with a paper toque and tunic, tricolore ribbon, the whole bit. My previous training consisted of being hopeless as a short-order cook at a 24-hour diner called Alligator Alley, where I learned to clean and cook said alligators. Excellent, the resort manager said, when can you start?<br />It was in that vast kitchen I fell in love with a Hobart planetary mixer—a big one, on a cast-iron floor stand, with an aluminum kettle and dough hooks out of Peter Pan’s nightmares. Dude, when you turned that thing on, anything you wanted mixed was mixed with extreme prejudice. Whisking 300 eggs? Set that bad boy on High Speed and stand back. I always wondered what happened to the previous chef."
