    "body": "If progressives are taking any responsibility for last week’s rout of Democrats nationwide, they aren’t showing it. Witness the long knives coming out for Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown, who won an election against a left-wing favorite.<br />Mr. Brown won a fifth term after defeating Democratic socialist India Walton, who had beaten Mr. Brown in a June primary with promises to defund the Buffalo Police Department and put a moratorium on charter schools. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigned for her."
