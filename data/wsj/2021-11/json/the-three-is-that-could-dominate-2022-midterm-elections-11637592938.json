    "body": "There’s nearly a year to go before the congressional midterm elections, but it isn’t too early to see what Republicans want those elections to be about. They want to focus voter attention on three I’s: inflation, immigration and identity politics—specifically, whether Democrats now are the ones practicing identity politics.<br />For Democrats, that is a potentially toxic mixture. They need to shift the focus to friendlier terrain, which they think they have started to do with success on infrastructure and social-spending legislation. They still have time, but also need to worry that perceptions can harden long before votes are cast."
