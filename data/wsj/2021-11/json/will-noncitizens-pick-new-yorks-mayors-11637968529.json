    "body": "New York has been a dynamic city for a long time, and immigrants are a big reason. Yet you can agree with that statement and still oppose a Democratic plan to let roughly 800,000 noncitizens vote in local elections for mayor, City Council, and so on. The council plans to consider a measure to that end on Dec. 9, and according to the New York Post it has enough support to pass.<br />The proposal, offered by Manhattan Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez, would permit voting by immigrants with either green cards or work authorization. The latter aren’t even necessarily long-term U.S. residents. “This is not about a favor, this is about taxation without representation,” Mr. Rodriguez said in September. “If people have a problem with this, then they should move to another town or another country that has not been built by immigrants.”"
