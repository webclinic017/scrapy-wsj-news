    "body": "Regarding Daniel Henninger’s “Joe Biden’s Trumpian Excess” (Wonder Land, Nov. 18): If we define a statesman as someone who sacrifices short-term partisan gain for longer-term partisan term, then today’s Democrats are certainly statesmen.<br />They have proved willing to sacrifice a loss in the legislature and perhaps the White House to inflate the country with what will become millions of new voters who will change the country. Even if some of them sometimes vote Republican, it will be for a different Republican Party, perhaps one with a populist temperament. Changes will be irrevocable at least for a few generations, until the new voters assimilate to America’s political culture. We could call this the “toothpaste out of the tube” approach to politics."
