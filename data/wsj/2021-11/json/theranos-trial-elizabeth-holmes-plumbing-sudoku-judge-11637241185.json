    "body": "SAN JOSE, Calif.—Keeping Silicon Valley’s highest-profile criminal trial on track was challenging enough for U.S. District Judge Edward Davila. Then a water main broke.<br />“There’s a hole down on the corner of San Fernando and First Street, with a lot of men with yellow jackets staring down the hole, so that suggests something,” Judge Davila said on a recent Wednesday. He closed the courtroom because of inoperable bathrooms, losing a day of testimony in the fraud trial of Theranos Inc. founder Elizabeth Holmes."
