    "body": "The Women’s Tennis Association called on the Chinese government to investigate allegations of sexual assault against a former senior official posted on the social media account of professional tennis star Peng Shuai, risking backlash in a country that has punished foreign sports organizations for wading into its domestic politics.<br />“Peng Shuai, and all women, deserve to be heard, not censored,” WTA chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steve Simon said in a statement released Sunday. “We expect this issue to be handled properly, meaning the allegations must be investigated fully, fairly, transparently and without censorship.”"
