    "body": "When defense attorneys for Kyle Rittenhouse put their teenage client on the stand this week in his murder trial in Wisconsin, they defied the conventional wisdom that criminal defendants are better off keeping silent.<br />Mr. Rittenhouse, now 18 years old, riveted jurors and millions of people watching online with hours of testimony Wednesday at his trial for homicide in the killing of two people during unrest spurred by the police shooting of Jacob Blake last year in Kenosha, Wis. Jury deliberations are expected to begin Monday."
