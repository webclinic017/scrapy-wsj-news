    "body": "In his Nov. 4 letter, economist Paul Sheard makes three comments on our op-ed “The Monetary Bathtub Is Overflowing” (Oct. 22). They are all wrong.<br />Mr. Sheard’s first claim is: “If monetary growth was the cause of the inflation, real personal consumption numbers would be rocketing.” Incorrect. When monetary growth is excessive, nominal GDP (real growth plus inflation) rockets. This is exactly what has happened. The average year-over-year growth of nominal GDP for the second and third quarters of this year was 13.2%."
