    "body": "Huge selloffs last week from companies such as Peloton Interactive and Zillow Group were a lesson in what happens when you oversell a clearly unsustainable status quo.<br />DoorDash  wants to avoid making the same mistake. On Tuesday, the company reported another solid quarter of results with sales, orders and gross order value topping Wall Street’s estimates. On the heels of last year’s pandemic feast, though, growth is slowing in a big way. DoorDash’s third quarter revenue grew 45% year on year, slowing from 70% growth in the second quarter and 222% in the first."
