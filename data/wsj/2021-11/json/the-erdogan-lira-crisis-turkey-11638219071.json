    "body": "One currency crisis in a career is usually more than enough for any politician. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan isn’t content with only one currency crisis a year. Which is how the lira has come to be plunging headlong into its second disaster of 2021 as Mr. Erdogan sticks to policies that are hammering Turkey’s middle class.<br />The lira has lost more than a third of its value relative to the dollar this year, and all signs are that inflation is spiking again. Official measures of inflation have approached 20% year-on-year in recent months. Monetary expert Steve Hanke at Johns Hopkins University estimates the true rate is above 66%. Households are abandoning the lira and stockpiling dollars instead, while companies are finding it difficult to borrow abroad and instead must dip into their cash reserves."
