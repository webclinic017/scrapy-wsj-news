    "body": "WASHINGTON—When the Biden administration’s new security agreement with Australia and the U.K. caused a rupture with the U.S.’s oldest ally, no presidential envoy was on the ground in Paris to smooth relations with the Élysée Palace.<br />President Biden has nominated former Ambassador to Belgium Denise Bauer to serve as ambassador to France, but she is awaiting Senate confirmation. Weeks passed before Mr. Biden sat beside French President Emmanuel Macron and acknowledged his “clumsy” handling of the affair. And Mr. Macron said, “Now what’s important is precisely to be sure that such a situation will not be possible for our future.”"
