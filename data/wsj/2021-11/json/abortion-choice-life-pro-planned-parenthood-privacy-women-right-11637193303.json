    "body": "Lance Morrow lumps the obliteration of boundaries relating to race, gender, drugs, pornography and abortion as the cause of societal disintegration in America (“An Age of Violated Boundaries,” op-ed, Nov. 11).<br />Mr. Morrow, like some latter-day Anthony Comstock, sees his boundaries as a necessary preservative of civilized society. Comstock said of his 1873 laws criminalizing obscenity, pornography, birth control and abortion: “God has set certain natural barriers. If you turn loose the passions and break down that fear you bring worse disaster than the war. It would debase sacred things, break down the health of women and disseminate a greater curse than the plagues and diseases of Europe.”"
