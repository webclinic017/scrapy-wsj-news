    "body": "Eric Adams won the race for New York mayor on a vow to reduce crime and homelessness, and he’s already facing a threat of “riots,” “fire” and worse if he follows through.<br />That’s what happened Wednesday after the Mayor-elect hosted members of a local Black Lives Matter chapter to hear out their agenda. The harangue started almost immediately. “Everybody talks about ‘good cops,’” said group co-founder Hawk Newsome. “We don’t believe in good cops.” Mr. Adams spent 22 years as a cop before entering politics."
