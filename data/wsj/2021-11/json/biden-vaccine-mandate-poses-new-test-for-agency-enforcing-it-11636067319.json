    "body": "The enforcement of President Biden’s private-sector vaccine mandate will in large measure come down to the employees themselves, as the government agency whose mission is to improve workplace safety works to play a bigger role in defeating the pandemic.<br />The Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, is enforcing the mandate, which requires workers at larger private-sector companies to be vaccinated against Covid-19 or tested weekly. The requirements, detailed Thursday and set to take effect Jan. 4, will cover more than 80 million workers."
