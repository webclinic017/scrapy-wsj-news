    "body": "In the reign of China’s Ming dynasty, the full kowtow involved “three kneelings and nine prostrations.” Perhaps it’s a sign of progress that the Ming emperors’ modern successor seems to be satisfied with two.<br />That’s the tentative conclusion we can draw from the self-abasement last week of Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, before the Chinese Communist Party. Mr. Dimon found himself in potential trouble with the current executors of the Mandate of Heaven when he repeated a joke he said he had told in Hong Kong earlier: “The Communist Party is celebrating its hundredth year. So is JPMorgan. I’d make you a bet we last longer.”"
