    "body": "There are some fundamental changes under way in how companies train their workers.<br />Out are the long, boring, in-person classes that companies have used for decades to get employees up to speed on every aspect of their jobs.

And they are using new ways of packaging that training, making it more palatable and useful to workers who often got bored or distracted with sitting in a classroom or watching endless videos."
