    "body": "Federal Reserve policy makers have made clear they don’t think the economy is close to full employment yet. When might it be?<br />The Labor Department on Friday reported that the U.S. added 531,000 jobs last month, better than the 450,000-job gain economists expected. Also, employment figures for August and September were revised up by a combined 235,000 jobs. The summer’s slowdown in the labor market doesn’t look quite so serious anymore, and in any case it may now be over."
