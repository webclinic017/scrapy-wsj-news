    "body": "SYDNEY—Australia will strengthen its capabilities in quantum science and other technologies that could be used to counter threats from China, providing more detail on the type of innovations Australia might develop alongside the U.S. under a new security partnership.<br />Australia will invest the equivalent of about $81 million (111 million Australian dollars) in quantum technology, including for a hub that will foster strategic partnerships with like-minded countries to commercialize Australia’s quantum research, officials said. It’s just one of many critical technologies—including ultra-advanced 6G communications, genetic engineering and alternative fuels—that Australia plans to focus on in the coming years."
