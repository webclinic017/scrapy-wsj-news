    "body": "What do Americans believe when you dig beneath daily politics into their fundamental beliefs and sense of identity? For the past 12 years, the Public Religion Research Institute and the Brookings Institution have collaborated on an annual American Values Survey, which attempts to find the answers.<br />This year’s poll, released on Monday, offers many remarkable findings. (I’m part of the Brookings team that helped draft the survey.) Some 43% of my fellow citizens, and 63% of Republicans, don’t regard me as “truly American.” That’s because I am not a Christian. Tens of millions of Christians will be disturbed to learn that they aren’t regarded as truly American, either: 62% of Republicans say that only the native-born are truly American. Tens of millions of atheists and agnostics will be disturbed to discover that 56% of their fellow citizens, and 78% of Republicans, say that true Americans must believe in God."
