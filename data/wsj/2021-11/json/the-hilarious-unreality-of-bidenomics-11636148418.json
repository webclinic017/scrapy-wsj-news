    "body": "President Joe Biden took no questions from the media after making a statement in response to Friday morning’s employment report from the Department of Labor. The report was encouraging, though not the titanic achievement he described. Perhaps he was hoping that his statement could somehow manage to speak for itself. Meanwhile the president’s energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, may be wishing she had said nothing at all in response to a question on gasoline prices and U.S. oil supply.<br />Appearing live on Bloomberg television from a climate conference in Glasgow, Ms. Granholm was naturally asked about recent increases in the price of gasoline and the U.S. policy response. Bloomberg’s Tom Keene reasonably inquired: “What is the Granholm plan to increase oil production in America?”"
