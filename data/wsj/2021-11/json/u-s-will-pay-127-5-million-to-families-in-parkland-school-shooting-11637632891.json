    "body": "The U.S. government will pay $127.5 million to families of students and staff killed and survivors of a 2018 shooting at a South Florida high school, a person familiar with the matter said, settling lawsuits over the FBI’s failure to investigate tips warning the shooter had guns and planned to attack.<br />The settlement resolves claims made by 40 survivors and families of 16 of the 17 people killed in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., the person said. The victims’ lawsuits focused on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s failure to act on tips it received before the massacre, one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history."
