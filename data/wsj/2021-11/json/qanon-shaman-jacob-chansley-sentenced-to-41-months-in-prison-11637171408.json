    "body": "WASHINGTON—Jacob Chansley, the self-described “QAnon Shaman” photographed at the Jan. 6 riot wearing a Viking hat with fur and horns, was sentenced to more than three years in prison Wednesday by a federal judge who said he believed Mr. Chansley showed genuine remorse but his actions at the Capitol were too horrific to prescribe lesser punishment.<br />“Obstructing the functioning of the government is the type of conduct that is so serious that I cannot justify” less time than sentencing guidelines recommend, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said, imposing a 41-month sentence."
