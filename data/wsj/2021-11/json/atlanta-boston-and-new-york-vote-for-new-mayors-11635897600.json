    "body": "Boston voters chose city councilor Michelle Wu as mayor, making her the first woman and first person of color elected to lead Massachusetts’ capital.<br />The Associated Press declared Ms. Wu, 36 years old, to be the winner Tuesday night over Annissa Essaibi George, also a city councilor. Ms. Wu had 60% of votes in the two-person race with 52% of precincts reporting. Both are Democrats, though the Boston mayoral race is officially nonpartisan."
