    "body": "As a disillusioned Vietnam veteran betrayed by his president (Lyndon Johnson) and his feckless defense secretary (Robert McNamara), who sent me off to a war he had already decided couldn’t be won, and as a retired military professional disgusted with our chaotic and humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan, I thoroughly support Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster’s thesis: “Honor Veterans by Having the Will to Win a War” (op-ed, Nov. 11). It is time for our government to adopt the Powell doctrine: War is a last resort, but if we go to war, commit to winning. Garner the support of the people and commit enough force to win. There is no other way to do it.<br />Col. Rick Anderschat, USA (Ret.)"
