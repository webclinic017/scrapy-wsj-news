    "body": "SAN JOSE, Calif.—Theranos Inc. investors included a roster of celebrity-caliber business moguls, wealthy families and government figureheads. Alan Eisenman isn’t one of those people.<br />Yet the fiery Texan has been one of the most memorable witnesses in the 10-week-old criminal-fraud trial of Elizabeth Holmes. In addition to providing emphatic testimony and theatrics to a packed courtroom, he has been a complicated witness for lawyers on both sides, and at times a disruptive court guest the judge had to admonish."
