How many will live up to them and how will anyone know if they are complying?<br />A sampling of new commitments includes  United Airlines Holdings Inc.,  which says it will replace 5% of its jet fuel with biofuel alternatives by 2030, and more than 450 banks and other financial firms who say they are shifting their businesses toward clean energy.
