    "body": "ALBANY N.Y.—Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo misused state resources for personal profit when he required government aides to help produce his pandemic memoir during work hours, according to a report issued Monday by a state committee investigating possible impeachment of the former Democratic governor.<br />Assemblyman Charles Lavine, a Long Island Democrat who oversaw the investigation, said the report’s findings are “extremely disturbing and is indicative of someone who is not fit for office.” Mr. Cuomo resigned from office in August, and leaders of the Democratic-controlled State Assembly said it was unlikely the chamber would proceed with an impeachment vote."
