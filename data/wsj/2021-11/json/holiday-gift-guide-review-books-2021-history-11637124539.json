    "body": "The past five years have been a difficult time for supporters of the Anglo-American model of politics, whose traditions include compromise and what Walter Bagehot called “discussion.” The Brexit vote in 2016 ushered in a period of political rancor for Britain, and the election of Donald Trump set off the furies in U.S. politics. Luckily there have been superb history books in the past year to turn to for solace and instruction—and for a reminder that bitter division is not a permanent condition.<br />Clare Jackson’s “Devil-Land: England Under Siege, 1588-1688”  gives a portrait of England between the defeat of the Spanish Armada and the Glorious Revolution. During much of that time, England was regarded as a failed state—in the words of a contemporary observer, the “Devil’s Land.” The country was riven by intense disagreements over politics and religion, and it was subject to repeated outside interventions, not least the Dutch invasion led by William of Orange in 1688 that secured parliamentary liberties."
