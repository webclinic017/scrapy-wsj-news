    "body": "Two of China’s biggest private tutoring companies say they will exit a key business by the end of the year, casualties of Beijing’s clampdown on the sector.<br />New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc.,  with $4.3 billion in revenue and listed in Hong Kong and New York, said Monday it would stop offering after-school academic tutoring for students from kindergarten to grade nine in mainland China by next year. Those activities accounted for 50%-60% of its revenue in each of its past two fiscal years, the company said in a filing with the Hong Kong stock exchange."
