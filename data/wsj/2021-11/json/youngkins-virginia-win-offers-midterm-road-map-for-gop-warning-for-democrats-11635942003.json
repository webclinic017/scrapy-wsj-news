    "body": "WASHINGTON—Republican Glenn Youngkin’s victory in the Virginia election for governor on Tuesday gave his party hopes that it had found new strategies for regaining control of Congress next year, while leaving Democrats worried about a dispirited voter base.<br />Mr. Youngkin’s triumph over Democrat Terry McAuliffe, which was called by the Associated Press early Wednesday morning, was the first statewide win for Republicans in Virginia since 2009 and marked a substantial swing from 2020, when President Biden carried the state by 10 percentage points."
