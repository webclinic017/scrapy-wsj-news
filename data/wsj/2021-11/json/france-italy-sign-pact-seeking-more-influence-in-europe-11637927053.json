    "body": "ROME—France and Italy signed a cooperation treaty on Friday that its advocates hope could shift the balance of power in the European Union, matching Germany’s influence by deepening cooperation between the bloc’s second- and third-biggest members.<br />The Franco-Italian treaty, which carries echoes of the 1963 treaty between France and Germany that put their partnership at the heart of the European project, is aimed at bolstering collaboration on areas such as foreign policy and defense, industrial policy and the EU’s fiscal rules."
