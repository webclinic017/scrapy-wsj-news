    "body": "Throughout his run for Virginia governor, Terry McAuliffe has stayed on message. This means campaigning against Donald Trump instead of the Republican on the ballot, Glenn Youngkin. Mr. McAuliffe stuck faithfully to script—until Saturday, when out of nowhere he told CNN’s Dana Bash: “This is not about Trump.”<br />That must have been news to Ms. Bash. In an Oct. 10 interview with Mr. McAuliffe, she quipped: “I’m glad I have two cups here, so I can keep drinking when you mention Donald Trump’s name.”"
