    "body": "Progressives upset about Tuesday’s results are blaming the Republican surge on culture-war fury. That can’t explain the race in New Jersey, where GOP candidate Jack Ciattarelli came close to victory with a campaign focused on the cost of living. The taxes and spending that voters rejected in the Garden State are a state-wide version of the Biden agenda.<br />By our deadline, Mr. Ciattarelli trailed Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy by 16,385 votes, or 0.68%. Mr. Murphy may claim vindication if he holds on, but there is shock behind that confidence. The Real Clear Politics polling average on Election Day gave the incumbent a nearly eight-point advantage. Like Virginia, this race swung late and hard."
