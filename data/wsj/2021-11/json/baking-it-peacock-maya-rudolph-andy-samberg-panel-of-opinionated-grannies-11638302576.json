    "body": "When “The French Chef” hit the airwaves in 1963, Julia Child could hardly have imagined that there would be as many cooking shows on TV as there are now. Or that so many would have so little to do with cooking.<br />Peacock’s “Baking It” is the latest entry into a genre in which physics (“Baking Impossible”), architecture (“Bake Squad”) and abject failure (“Nailed It!”) have been vying with the pure competition, gluttony and ill will that already dominate so many TV food shows. While there are several programs from which a fledgling cook or baker can actually learn something (“Christopher Kimball’s Milk Street” is a favorite, along with “Good Eats” and “America’s Test Kitchen”), “Baking It,” with its Barry Manilow-inspired theme song, has taken a good bit of inspiration from the beloved “Great British Baking Show,” tossing out the Bakewell tarts, Victoria sandwiches and hot-water-crust pastries in favor of an indigestible combination of heartwarming and snarky, as whipped up by hosts Andy Samberg and Maya Rudolph. Those comical presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins were great on the original “GBBS,” but one didn’t tune in just to see them."
