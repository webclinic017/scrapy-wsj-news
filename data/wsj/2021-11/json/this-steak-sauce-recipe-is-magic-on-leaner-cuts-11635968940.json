    "body": "FOR A LEAN CUT of beef like flank, hanger or skirt steak, chef Tomos Parry favors this chunky, savory sauce. A combination of toasted walnuts, charred spring onions and radishes, chopped gherkins and capers, parsley and thyme, the sauce balances the beef with a bit of bite and lots of flavor.<br />In Mr. Parryâ€™s second Slow Food Fast recipe, he serves a side of roasted beets with the steak and the sauce, his own invention, taking cues from the walnut-based sauces of Italy and Argentine chimichurri."
