    "body": "The U.S. government could run out of resources to meet the nationâ€™s obligations as soon as Dec. 15, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday, renewing questions about how Democrats and Republicans in Congress will resolve a standoff about raising or suspending the federal borrowing limit.<br />Ms. Yellen provided the fresh estimate of when the federal government might no longer be able to pay all of its bills in a letter to Capitol Hill leaders. She had previously said that a debt-limit increase passed by Congress in October provided confidence that the federal government would be able to pay its bills at least through Dec. 3."
