    "body": "Congress has a public approval rating of 22%, which makes us wonder what the 22% are watching. It can’t be C-SPAN. If they pay attention to this week’s spectacle involving Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar, the 22% are likely to join the other 78%.<br />Mr. Gosar, a Republican, illustrates the decline of Congress in profile. He tweeted an anime video of the Congressman attacking a character with the face of Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and swinging a sword at a character with President Biden’s face."
