    "body": "It is understandable that some of President Biden’s political appointments will be concessions to different groups. But Saule Omarova is next-level (“‘We Want Them to Go Bankrupt,’” Review & Outlook, Nov. 16). This is someone who fondly reflects on her days growing up in the U.S.S.R. and advocates for the government to direct investment and even production—otherwise known as socialism.<br />People were fussed with the bait-and-switch of Lina Khan, who was clearly nominated to pander to the left. But an underqualified Federal Trade Commission chair with a chip on her shoulder will likely be stymied by the courts before she can do too much damage. Ms. Omarova as comptroller of the currency, on the other hand, could bleed companies dry by mucking up credit facilities for entire industries before the courts have a chance to intervene. I hope senators will take notice."
