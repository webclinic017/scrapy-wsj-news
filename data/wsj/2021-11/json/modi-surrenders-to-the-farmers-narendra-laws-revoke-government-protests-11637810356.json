    "body": "For a politician elected for his strong leadership, Narendra Modi is pretty good at abject surrender. Last week he appeared on national television to announce the repeal of three market-friendly farm laws passed by his government last year.<br />“With a true mind and a pure heart, I want to say that perhaps there was some deficiency in our penance because of which we were not able to explain to some of our farmer brothers a truth as clear as the light of an oil lamp,” Mr. Modi said in Hindi. Translation: The laws would have helped farmers, but I’m scrapping them anyway because the government couldn’t convince protesters of their merit."
