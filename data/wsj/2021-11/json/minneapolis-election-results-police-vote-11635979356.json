    "body": "With crime surging in many cities, voters rejected the anti-police left this week. Minneapolis was the birthplace of the defund the police movement, but on Tuesday more than 56% of voters rejected a proposal to abolish the police department. The ballot measure would have replaced the MPD with a vaguely defined Department of Public Safety and eliminated from the city charter requirements for a police chief and a minimum level of police funding.<br />Violent crime is up nearly 30% in Minneapolis this year compared to the first 10 months of 2019. The police force has lost about a third of its officers, and response times for 911 calls now average about 15 minutes. Minneapolis voters were mugged by reality."
