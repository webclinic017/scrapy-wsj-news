So a wander through “Holbein: Capturing Character in the Renaissance,” at the J. Paul Getty Museum through Jan. 9, 2022, might seem confounding. His pictures seem similar. Most are small, with some measuring just a few inches across. All are half- or three-quarter length images, and most are set against a marine blue background. The sitters often look away, avoiding the viewer’s gaze. They clasp their hands together or clutch an object. Many seem grim."
