    "body": "‘Just have fun,” Richard Williams tells his young daughters more than once in “King Richard.” Remarkably, they do.<br />Why should that be remarkable? Because the daughters are Venus and Serena Williams, and Richard, played with magisterial zest by Will Smith, is the relentless taskmaster, disciplinarian, teacher, self-anointed moralist, pro tem agent and self-taught coach who is determined to lift them out of the ghetto, which Richard pronounces fastidiously as “get-toe,” by making them two of the greatest tennis players the world has ever seen. Through all the rigors of their training, though, the girls, played delightfully by Saniyya Sidney (she’s Venus) and Demi Singleton (she’s Serena), sustain high spirits and remain beguiling gigglers. The movie, playing in theaters and streaming on HBO Max, pulls off a similar trick. It’s serious at bottom. It means to teach and inspire, as well as entertain, and takes on more subjects of consequence than you can shake a racket at—among them race, parenting, marital dynamics, the weight of personal history and the mad commercialization of sports. Yet it’s marvelous fun from start to finish."
