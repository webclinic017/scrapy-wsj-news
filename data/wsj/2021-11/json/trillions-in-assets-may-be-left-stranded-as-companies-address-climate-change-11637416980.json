    "body": "At the end of 2019,  General Motors Co.  announced a $1 billion investment to produce a new generation of Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon pickup trucks at its factory in Wentzville, Mo.<br />Just over a year later, GM said it would go all electric by 2035. Analysts are worried that some of the new Wentzville machinery could end up on the scrap heap, adding to a multitrillion-dollar pile of assets that will lose value as the country shifts away from fossil fuels."
