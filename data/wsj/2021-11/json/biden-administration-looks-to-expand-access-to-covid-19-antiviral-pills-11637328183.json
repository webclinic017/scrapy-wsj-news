    "body": "The Biden administration is exploring ways to expand access to promising Covid-19 antivirals that can keep people out of the hospital when the pills become more plentiful in coming months, according to a person familiar with the planning.<br />The administration has purchased enough supplies of an oral drug from  Pfizer Inc.  to treat 10 million people for free through a $5.29 billion agreement announced Thursday, should health regulators give it the green light. The courses purchased by the federal government are expected to be allocated to the states, which would then direct them to locations such as pharmacies, hospitals and nursing homes."
