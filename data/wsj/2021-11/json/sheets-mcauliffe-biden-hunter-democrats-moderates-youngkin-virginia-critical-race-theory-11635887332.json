    "body": "However the race came out on Tuesday night, it was fitting that Terry McAuliffe’s easy run to the Virginia governorship blew up over the school board issue, itself an absurd culmination of the Democratic strategy of painting every opponent of their policies as a white supremacist and pro-Trump Nazi.<br />Joe Biden came to the presidency gifted with two vaccines, a rocket ship of an economic rebound, and a mandate for moderation, and yet has acted in office like his only constituency is the left. If he can’t satisfy their every policy wish, as I pointed out in May, at least he can give them the white supremacist menace."
