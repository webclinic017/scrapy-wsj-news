    "body": "The trial of the three white Georgia men charged in the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man, began Nov. 5. in Brunswick, Ga.<br />Prosecutors argued Gregory McMichael, his son Travis McMichael and neighbor William “Roddie” Bryan Jr. hunted down Mr. Arbery and killed him based on sketchy suspicions. Defense attorneys argued he was killed by men trained in law enforcement who were protecting their neighborhood after a rash of burglaries and thefts."
