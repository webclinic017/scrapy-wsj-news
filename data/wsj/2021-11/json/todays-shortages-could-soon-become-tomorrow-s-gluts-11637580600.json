    "body": "In the throes of the sticker shock many Americans have been experiencing lately, it is hard to remember an oft-repeated lesson: Shortages can suddenly turn into gluts.<br />The combination of bottlenecks and robust demand has pushed prices for all kinds of things higher, but some of the most eye-popping increases have been in the prices of manufactured goods that rely on global supply chains. The October consumer inflation report from the Labor Department showed prices for washers and dryers were up 30.1% last month from the pandemic’s start, with prices for furniture up 12% and prices for new cars and trucks up 11.3%."
