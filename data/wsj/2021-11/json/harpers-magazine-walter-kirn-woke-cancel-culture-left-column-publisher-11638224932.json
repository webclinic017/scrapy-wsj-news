    "body": "In his interview with Tunku Varadarajan (“Middle America’s Defiant Defender,” The Weekend Interview, Nov. 27), Walter Kirn falsely implies that his contract with Harper’s Magazine was “terminated” because of displeasure with his Easy Chair column headlined “Illiberal Values,” in which he denounced supposedly enlightened liberals for having become “insufferable pedants and sermonizers.” In fact, we did not renew his contract—after he wrote two more columns—because his copy was consistently late and he was complaining about a crushing book deadline. Both he and the magazine agreed that he should take a break from writing the column and finish his book. On this particular column, Mr. Kirn ran into conflict with the fact checker, but the fact checker was overruled by the editor and Mr. Kirn’s opinions stayed put.<br />It borders on the absurd for Mr. Kirn to play the martyr to left-wing orthodoxy at Harper’s, since the magazine’s reputation for defending liberalism and criticizing political correctness and “wokeness” is now world renowned. We set a very high standard in this regard: Indeed, the two Easy Chair columnists who followed Mr. Kirn, Lionel Shriver and Thomas Chatterton Williams, have been much tougher on the censorious, intolerant left than Mr. Kirn ever was."
