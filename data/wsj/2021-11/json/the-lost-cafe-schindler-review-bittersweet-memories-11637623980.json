    "body": "It may sound bizarre that a family memoir of the Holocaust would include recipes for such Austrian delicacies as apple strudel, Linzer torte and Sacher torte. But it was these mouthwatering pastries that, in the years before Hitler annexed Austria in 1938, attracted crowds to Innsbruck’s popular Café Schindler, a convivial establishment alive with nightly music and dancing—owned and run, until the Nazis seized it, by a local Jewish family named Schindler.<br />This explains the lingering tastes and luscious aromas that permeate Meriel Schindler’s affecting “The Lost Café Schindler: One Family, Two Wars, and the Search for Truth.” Add to that Innsbruck’s stunning setting in the mountainous Austrian Tyrol, and the mood is set for the Schindler family’s prosperous pre-World War II assimilation and seeming acceptance into Austrian society—and the Nazis’ ruthless transformation of their world to wreckage."
