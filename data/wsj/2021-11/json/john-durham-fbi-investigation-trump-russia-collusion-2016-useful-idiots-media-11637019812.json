    "body": "Holman Jenkins’s “Durham Sails Into Deep Waters” (Business World, Nov. 13) raises the question of whether the special counsel’s itinerary includes stops at ports of call previously managed by senior leadership at the Western world’s premiere investigatory agency. The three indictments filed by John Durham’s office place the FBI in the position of the “victim” of false statements made by a Clinton campaign lawyer and a Russian national with Kremlin ties serving as the “primary sub-source” for Christopher Steele’s Russian dossier, and by a partisan FBI counsel willing to alter an email about Carter Page to facilitate issuance of a FISA warrant.<br />Unquestionably, the making of false statements or the submission of tampered documents would render the perpetrators culpable. But the question remains whether senior officials at federal law-enforcement agencies, after having investigated the matter and discovered their falsity, nonetheless portrayed them as “verified” in seeking surveillance orders."
