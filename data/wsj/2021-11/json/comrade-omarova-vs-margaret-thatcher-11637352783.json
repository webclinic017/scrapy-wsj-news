    "body": "President Joe Biden’s nominee to oversee most of the banking assets  in the United States had a rocky confirmation hearing in the Senate on Thursday. Readers of Journal editorials know comptroller of the currency nominee Saule Omarova as the activist who has spoken in glowing terms about the idea of a Federal Reserve takeover of consumer bank deposits and also bankrupting fossil-fuel companies.<br />Rather than trying to defend the indefensible on Thursday the Cornell law professor opted instead to say that she really didn’t really mean to say what she had said about energy firms and suggested her promotion of a massive expansion of Fed power was simply intended to spark discussion."
