    "body": "Zoom’s new normal isn’t here yet, but it’s getting closer.<br />The company formally known as  Zoom Video Communications  posted mixed results for its fiscal third quarter late Monday. Revenue of $1.05 billion was about 3% ahead of Wall Street’s estimates and the company’s projection for revenue of the same amount for the fiscal fourth quarter was likewise about 3% above analysts’ forecasts. But that also represents the first lack of sequential growth in the young company’s history, serving as yet another reminder that booming demand from the Covid-19 pandemic has largely ebbed."
