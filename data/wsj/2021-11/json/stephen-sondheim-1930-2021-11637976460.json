    "body": "<br />Unlike the character from “A Little Night Music” who sings his best-known song, “Send in the Clowns,” Stephen Sondheim had not lost his timing when he died on Friday at age 91. Not only is Classic Stage Company putting on an exceptional revival of “Assassins,” his most provocative musical, but a major revival of “Company,” the show that put him at the center of American musical theater in 1970, opens on Broadway in two weeks. In a sense, the curtain dropped on his extraordinary life at just the right moment."
