    "body": "Hondurans are voting Sunday in a tense presidential election that pits a ruling party dogged by allegations of corruption against the wife of a controversial former leftist president deposed by the military.<br />U.S. officials fear that the election could touch off violence and instability that would prompt further migration by Hondurans to the U.S. The outcomeÂ could also determine whether the small Central American nation continues to recognize Taiwan or switches allegiance to China, as promised by the leading leftist candidate."
