    "body": "SEOUL— Alphabet Inc.’s  Google plans to continue charging South Korean app developers a service fee for in-app purchases, even as users for the first time globally can choose to use third-party payment platforms rather than Google’s.<br />In a Thursday announcement, Google outlined how it plans to comply with a South Korean law that took effect in September. It was the world’s first bill challenging Google and Apple Inc.’s dominance over how apps on their platforms sell their digital goods—and offered, in theory, a way for developers to lower commissions and cut prices for consumers."
