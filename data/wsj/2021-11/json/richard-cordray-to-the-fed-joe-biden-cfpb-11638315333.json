    "body": "President Biden must really dislike banks. First he nominates radical Saule Omarova to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, though Senate Democrats may defeat her. Plan B to please progressives appears to be appointing Richard Cordray as the Federal Reserve vice chair for supervision.<br />We recently warned about Mr. Cordray’s possible selection, and the Journal reported on Tuesday that it is under active consideration. Trump appointee Randal Quarles’s term as vice chair for supervision recently ended, and progressives are demanding Mr. Biden appoint someone who will use the position’s broad powers to discipline banks. On that score, if not on any other, Mr. Cordray is well qualified."
