    "body": "WHETHER THE  travel nuts in your life are finally taking that long-delayed vacation abroad or planning a more modest adventure close to home, we’ve zeroed in on a few choice items and experiences to (happily) reacquaint them with the wider world. You can book them a mini spa treatment in one of Paris’s most glamorous new hotels or an online mezcal mixology class based in Mexico City. Or perhaps you’d prefer to wrap up items that travel well but are just as gratifying at home (handmade Turkish slippers, for one, or pajamas from Claridge’s in London). And because air travel hasn’t gotten any more pleasurable, we’re also suggesting a collection of cuddly neck pillows. Whichever present you choose, all are 100% more likely to feed wanderlust than, say, socks.<br />In case international travel isn’t on your giftee’s calendar just yet, sign him or her up for a cooking class through  Airbnb ’s  Online Experiences program. Courses range from preparing pasta from scratch with nonnas in Italy to mixing mezcal cocktails with a bartender in Mexico City. After the 60-to- 90-minute sessions, the instructors email recipes, so those newfound skills can be paid forward to the delight of dinner guests. Classes from $30 per person, airbnb.com"
