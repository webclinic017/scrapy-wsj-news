    "body": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday the financial market trading controversy that led to the departure of two regional Fed bank presidents caught the central bank by surprise, adding the Fed has acted swiftly to ensure the situation never happens again.<br />“We didn’t imagine the problems that happened,” Mr. Powell said at the press conference following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. He was referring to stock trading and other financial transactions by the leaders of the Dallas and Boston Fed banks that led them in late September to announce their early retirements."
