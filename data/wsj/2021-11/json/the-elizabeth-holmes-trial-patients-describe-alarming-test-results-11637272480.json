    "body": "SAN JOSE, Calif.—Jurors in the criminal-fraud trial of Elizabeth Holmes heard this week from two patients who took Theranos Inc. blood tests that returned troubling results: one who believed she could be HIV-positive and another whose results could have been a sign of prostate cancer.<br />The testimony addresses a crucial element of the government’s case against Ms. Holmes, underpinning four of the 10 wire-fraud counts and one of two conspiracy-to-commit-wire-fraud counts against her by illustrating how she allegedly misled patients about the capabilities of Theranos’s blood-testing technology. These two patients are among the final witnesses in the government’s case, helping to bookend more than 10 weeks of testimony in the closely watched Silicon Valley trial."
