    "body": "Iran’s stockpile of near-weapons-grade nuclear fuel has jumped significantly, according to a confidential report by the United Nations atomic agency that found Tehran has almost doubled its output of highly enriched uranium in recent months, putting it closer to being able to produce the fuel needed for a nuclear weapon.<br />Iran produced 17.7 kilograms (38.94 pounds)  of 60% enriched uranium—its highest purity output so far—in early November, up from 10 kg in late August, meaning it is getting closer to having enough highly enriched nuclear fuel for a weapon."
