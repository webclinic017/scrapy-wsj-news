    "body": "WASHINGTON—Concerns about rising home heating costs are clouding prospects for a proposed tax on methane leaks in the $2 trillion social and climate spending bill backed by President Biden and congressional Democrats.<br />The tax would charge oil-and-gas producers for leaks of methane from wellheads, pipelines, storage tanks and other facilities. The Congressional Budget Office hasn’t weighed in the financial impact, but independent analysts have said it would cost producers between $1 billion and $10 billion annually."
