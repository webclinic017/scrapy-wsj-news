    "body": "2021 WAS supposed to usher happiness, even hedonism, back into our lives and, while it didn’t quite deliver, things are definitely looking up. This December, unlike last, many Americans are able to reunite with family and friends. And after months spent in schlubby sweats, why not give your favorite people the gift of style? In creating this gift guide, our fashion editors focused on joyful clothes, accessories and beauty indulgences that promise to dispel some of the uneasiness and worry we’ve all lived through—from a sturdy patchwork shirt with personality to a shimmering sequin handbag that will light the path to the new year. They’re all designed to help your loved ones reconnect with that endangered idea: fun.<br />Equip that ambitiously stylish guy you know with more than a bland button-up. We submit instead this handsome (and hard-wearing) patchworked shirt from New York label 3sixteen. Made in India from a hand-loomed cotton “khadi” fabric, its design combines panels in four different earth tones that conjure an arid “Dune”-like landscape. Should your recipient snag a seam (or just crave extra idiosyncrasy), he can always add his own patches atop this crafty hodgepodge. Patchwork BD Shirt, $240, 3sixteen.com"
