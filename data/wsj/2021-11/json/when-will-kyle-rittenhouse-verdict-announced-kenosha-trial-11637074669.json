    "body": "Kyle Rittenhouse, now 18 years old, faces charges of intentional, reckless and attempted homicide, and reckless endangerment. The case concerns the night of Aug. 25, 2020: Mr. Rittenhouse shot and killed two men and wounded another as he patrolled the city with a rifle and a small medical kit amid unrest after the police shooting of Jacob Blake.<br />Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed the misdemeanor charge of possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 17 years old. The defense had argued a person of that age could carry such a weapon under Wisconsin law as long as it wasn’t a short-barreled rifle. After the prosecution conceded that the AR-15-style rifle didn’t have a short barrel, Judge Schroeder dropped the charge. The judge also agreed to allow prosecutors to offer jurors a number of less serious charges to consider if they can’t agree on the more serious charges."
