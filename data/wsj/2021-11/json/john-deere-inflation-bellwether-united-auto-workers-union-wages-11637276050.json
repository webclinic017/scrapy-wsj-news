    "body": "Credit Deere & Co. employees for reading the moment. After a month or so on strike, they won a contract this week that their union negotiators might not have dreamed of a year ago. The episode reveals how inflation is seeping into business decisions and worker demands.<br />Some 10,000 union workers for the farm-equipment giant approved a labor contract Wednesday, ending a strike that began Oct. 14. The contract includes an $8,500 restart bonus, an immediate 10% raise, two 5% raises and two large bonuses through 2026. Total retirement benefits for an average worker will rise by $270,000. Most important as an economic signal, wages will be adjusted each quarter based on inflation."
