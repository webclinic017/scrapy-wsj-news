    "body": "CURVEBALLS, from the Delta variant to supply chain snafus, may be threatening the holidays. If procrastination or the many disruptions of 2021 mean you’re only now planning a seasonal getaway, consider these five wonderful-in-winter destinations where bookings are still available and room rates won’t break the bank.<br />Intrepid travelers with a thirst for Italy should consider Conegliano-Valdobbiadene, an appellation at the heart of Italy’s Prosecco production, in the province of Treviso. A onetime retreat for Venetian nobility, the area, aka the “Prosecco Hills,” comprises a mosaic of vineyards, rural villages, old churches and castles, and is one of Italy’s most recently designated Unesco World Heritage sites. It’s also strategically positioned: Venice is just an hour’s drive south, while to the north lie the scenic Veneto Dolomites and Parco Nazionale delle Dolomiti Bellunesi—about an hour by car. The stylish ski resort of Cortina d’Ampezzo is about a 90-minute drive from Conegliano. Source your own holiday fizz by visiting local wineries, like Villa Sandi, that open during the holidays (other than on Dec. 24 and Dec. 31). Bunk down at the Villa Abbazia, a Relais & Châteaux hotel housed in an 18th-century mansion and garden complex in the town of Follina. December rates from about $240 a night"
