    "body": "New York<br />One of the last times Cézanne’s nude bather (“Bather and Rocks,” c. 1860s), Picasso’s spindly caricatures (“Group of Characters,” 1929), and Pissarro’s young daughter (“Minette,” 1872) kept as close company as they do in the first two galleries of the Jewish Museum’s exhibition “Afterlives: Recovering the Lost Stories of Looted Art” was in 1944, when Germans in occupied Paris loaded them onto a train headed for a Czech castle. Expecting the train to hold prisoners, Free French fighters attacked, led by Alexandre Rosenberg, the son of the French-Jewish art dealer Paul Rosenberg. Alexandre found not only these works but a trove stolen from his own father, a drama that loosely inspired the 1964 film “The Train,” with Burt Lancaster."
