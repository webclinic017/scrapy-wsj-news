The incident at a Travis Scott festival over the weekend is providing a test of that strategy.<br />Live Nation is the world’s largest concert promotion company and is the owner of the Astroworld festival’s promoter. On Monday, its shares fell 5.4% in the first day of trading after the festival was cut short due to a crowd surge, eight deaths and multiple injuries."
