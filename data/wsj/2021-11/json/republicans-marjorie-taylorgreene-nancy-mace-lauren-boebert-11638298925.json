    "body": "WASHINGTON—Two prominent first-term Republican lawmakers publicly traded insults and argued over their conservative bona fides on Tuesday, just as party leaders have tried to quell dust-ups that have tested party unity.<br />Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has regularly scrapped with other Republican lawmakers as well as party leadership, called Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina the “trash in the GOP Conference” and not conservative. The attack came after Ms. Mace criticized another freshman Republican, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, for a widely condemned remark casting Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, one of two Muslim women in Congress, as a suicide bomber."
