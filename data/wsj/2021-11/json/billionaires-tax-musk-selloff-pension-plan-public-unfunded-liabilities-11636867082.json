    "body": "In “Ron Wyden’s Plan to Gut Capital Markets” (op-ed, Nov. 8), Hal Scott and John Gulliver show how the proposed “billionaires’ tax” on unrealized capital gains would hurt the middle class. But their article only scratches the surface by referencing the financial impact on retail stockholders and 401(k) plans.<br />Far more consequential would be the effect on public pension plans, which control approximately $34 trillion is assets world-wide, and hold trillions in U.S. equities. Every U.S. state, county and city sponsors pension funds that hold substantial assets invested in the public equity market to benefit the retirement security of firemen, policemen, teachers and other public-sector workers. The colossal equity-market selloff triggered by a billionaires’ tax would negatively affect the retirement security of tens of millions of U.S. workers covered by these public pension plans. It would also have a devastating knock-on effect on the fiscal health of states and municipalities, all of which are required to make annual calculations of unfunded pension liabilities. Ultimately, these liabilities would have to be made up for with higher taxes."
