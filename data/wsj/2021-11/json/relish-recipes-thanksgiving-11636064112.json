The cut-glass dish or silver platter that graced the table twice a year, with compartments tailor-made for stacks of crisp carrot spears and frilly celery sticks, sunny deviled eggs, piles of briny piccalilli, pickled beets and peppery radishes?<br />Depending on which corner of the country you hail from, you might call it crudités, or a grazing plate. At our ’80s-era holiday dinners outside Hartford, Conn., my cousins and I didn’t call it anything at all—we just nibbled the jumbo black olives off our fingertips while the grown-ups sipped Manhattans. Whatever moniker you use, nostalgia aside, this snappy spread of fresh veggies, piquant pickles, crunchy crackers and creamy dips remains one of the best big-enjoyment, low-effort ways to kick off a celebratory feast."
