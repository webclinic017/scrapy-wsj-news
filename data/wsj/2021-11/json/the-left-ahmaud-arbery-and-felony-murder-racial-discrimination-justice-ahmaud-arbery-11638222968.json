    "body": "Travis McMichael fired the shotgun blasts that killed Ahmaud Arbery in February 2020, and last week a Brunswick, Ga., jury found him guilty of “malice murder.” Two other men—Mr. McMichael’s father, Gregory, and William Bryan—were acquitted on that charge but found guilty of “felony murder,” which also carries a mandatory life sentence. Progressive criminal-justice reformers have argued that felony-murder laws are unjust, and they have a point.<br />Under the felony-murder rule, if someone is killed in the course of a felony, any participant in the felony may be criminally liable for murder. The defendant doesn’t need to have personally caused the death, intended to kill, or, under Georgia’s law, even acted with reckless disregard for human life."
