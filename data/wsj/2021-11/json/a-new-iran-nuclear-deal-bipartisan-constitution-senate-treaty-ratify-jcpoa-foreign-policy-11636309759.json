    "body": "The effort to bring bipartisan unity back to our government in Washington received an unexpected boost from an unlikely place last month. Iran’s new foreign minister, Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, said that if talks on restarting the nuclear agreement between Iran and the P5+1 begin (as appears likely later this month), Tehran would demand assurances that “Washington will not renege on the deal again.”<br />The only way to assure that is for President Biden to submit an agreement with Iran to the Senate as a treaty, needing 67 votes to be ratified. That would require support from members of both political parties. It would bring Washington, for a moment, back to bipartisanship in foreign policy."
