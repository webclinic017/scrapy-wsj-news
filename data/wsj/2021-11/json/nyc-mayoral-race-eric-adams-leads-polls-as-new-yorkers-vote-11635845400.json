    "body": "New York City voters will choose a new mayor for the first time in eight years as the city faces concerns about an uptick in violent crime and economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, a Democrat, is heavily favored to win over Republican Curtis Sliwa, a radio host and founder of the Guardian Angels anticrime group. Democrats outnumber Republicans in the cityâ€™s five boroughs by a six-to-one margin, and an Emerson College poll released last week showed Mr. Adams with a 40-point lead over Mr. Sliwa."
