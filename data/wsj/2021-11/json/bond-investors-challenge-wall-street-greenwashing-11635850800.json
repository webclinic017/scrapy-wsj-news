    "body": "Bond fund manager James Rich’s job is to find sustainable investments for his customers. Lately, he is rejecting much of what Wall Street is offering him.<br />Mr. Rich is part of a budding backlash among investors who are increasingly wary of “greenwashing” in bonds labeled as eco-friendly. One example: Mr. James cut a green bond issued by JPMorgan from the roughly $200 million sustainable investing portfolio he runs at Aegon Asset Management over doubts about the bank’s overall environmental record. A mutual fund he submanages for  Transamerica Asset Management Inc.  jettisoned the bond in the first quarter, according to financial filings by Transamerica."
