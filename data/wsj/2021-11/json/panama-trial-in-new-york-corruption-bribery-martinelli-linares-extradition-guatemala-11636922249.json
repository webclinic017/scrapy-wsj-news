    "body": "A three-judge Panamanian court last week absolved former President Ricardo Martinelli of charges that he ordered the illegal wiretapping of some 150 citizens during his 2009-14 tenure. But with the imminent U.S. extradition from Guatemala of his two sons, who face money-laundering charges in Brooklyn, N.Y., federal court, Mr. Martinelli’s troubles may be far from over.<br />Mr. Martinelli’s legal issues at home and abroad are problems not only for the family. Both the wiretapping case and the Justice Department’s case threaten to cast a dark shadow over the rule of law in one of the Western Hemisphere’s most strategically important countries, and to damage its image as a destination for capital."
