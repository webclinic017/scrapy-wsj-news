    "body": "Fantasia Holdings Group Co., the property developer whose surprise bond default last month helped heighten market concerns about Chinese real estate, said some lenders were asking for loans to be repaid early.<br />The companyâ€™s stock, which resumed trading after being halted since late September, plunged 37% Wednesday in Hong Kong to 36 Hong Kong cents a share, the equivalent of about 5 U.S. cents. That put the stock on course for its lowest close in its 12-year history, according to FactSet."
