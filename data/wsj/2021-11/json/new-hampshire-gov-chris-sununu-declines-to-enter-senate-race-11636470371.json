    "body": "WASHINGTON—New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu said he won’t run for the Senate, dealing a setback to Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s efforts to recruit top candidates in the Republican Party’s effort to reclaim control of the chamber.<br />Republicans had called Mr. Sununu, who has governed mostly as a centrist, one of their best hopes to win a Democrat-held seat if he ran. Mr. Sununu said at a press conference Tuesday morning that he won’t challenge incumbent Sen. Maggie Hassan for her seat and would instead run for a fourth term as governor."
