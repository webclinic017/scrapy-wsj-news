    "body": "Are President Biden and his Democratic Party proposing sweeping, revolutionary change to the economy and the government’s social contract with Americans? Or are they offering practical help to citizens struggling to overcome longstanding problems as they recover from the economic shock of a pandemic?<br />Some Democrats describe the former, others the latter. The difference may seem merely semantic, but in fact it has significant substantive effect: The split goes to the heart of a division within the Democratic Party that has plagued the effort to pass the Biden agenda, and to the problems Democrats and the president have had in winning broader public support for their plans."
