    "body": "A federal grand jury on Friday indicted former Trump adviser Steve Bannon on two counts of contempt of Congress, and the main fact to keep in mind is that Mr. Bannon brought this on himself. He has refused a subpoena to testify before Congress’s Select Committee on the Jan. 6 riots, and the government has every right to enforce it.<br />The fact that this is a Democratic Justice Department enforcing a contempt citation by a Democratic Congress doesn’t overrule the point. Mr. Bannon has no legal standing to dodge a lawful subpoena, and this one is certainly within Congress’s authority. The criminal contempt vote was 229-202, with nine Republicans joining the Democrats."
