    "body": "AUSTIN, Texas—Over nine weeks, a new Texas law effectively banning abortion after six weeks has transformed the state’s abortion climate.<br />The number of abortions performed in clinics has dropped. Some women have carried out their own abortions, such as one woman who took drugs she purchased from overseas. Others, including a 13-year-old assault victim, have fled Texas to other states, where clinics say they are overwhelmed by Texas demand."
