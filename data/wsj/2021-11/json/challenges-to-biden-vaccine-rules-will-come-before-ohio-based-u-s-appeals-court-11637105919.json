    "body": "WASHINGTON—A conservative-leaning U.S. appeals court in Cincinnati was randomly selected Tuesday to decide challenges to the Biden administration’s new rules requiring many employers to ensure their workers are vaccinated or tested weekly for Covid-19.<br />Legal challengers have petitioned federal appeals courts around the country to review the rules, formally issued earlier this month by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The requirements, which apply to businesses with 100 or more employees and cover roughly 84 million workers, are scheduled to take effect Jan. 4."
