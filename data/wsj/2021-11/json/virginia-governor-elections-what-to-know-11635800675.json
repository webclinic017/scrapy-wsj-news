    "body": "Virginia voters head to the polls Tuesday to choose their next governor in a competitive race between Democratic former Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Republican businessman Glenn Youngkin. Nearly every recent poll has shown an even contest, a potential sign of change, because Republicans haven’t won a statewide race in Virginia since 2009.<br />Also Tuesday, voters in New Jersey will decide their governor, and dozens of cities will vote in mayoral races. Voters in Boston are poised to elect a woman as mayor for the first time in the city’s history. The Minneapolis election—the first since the unrest following the killing of George Floyd in May 2020—includes a mayoral race and a ballot item to decide whether to replace the police department with a department of public safety."
