    "body": "Thank you, Andrew Fillat and Henry Miller, for “Nuclear Power Is the Best Climate-Change Solution by Far” (op-ed, Nov. 5). Since my childhood in West Virginia, deaths from coal-mine disasters and black-lung disease have added up. Gasoline-tanker mishaps have incinerated citizens on the highways. Yet the very thought of shipping heavily shielded canisters of nuclear waste to a safe repository somehow remains unthinkable. For generations, development of nuclear power has been thwarted by excessive regulations. Even amid the “existential threat” of climate change, few leaders are willing to mention the huge benefits of nuclear power.<br />Driving through the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia, I see what John Denver called our “mountain mama” covered with grotesque windmills that spoil the majestic natural views. Visiting family in North Dakota, I see farmland stretching for miles sacrificed to windmills. From California to Florida, we see thousands of acres of open land covered with solar panels. Every solar panel and windmill must be connected to the grid via thousands of miles of additional power lines."
