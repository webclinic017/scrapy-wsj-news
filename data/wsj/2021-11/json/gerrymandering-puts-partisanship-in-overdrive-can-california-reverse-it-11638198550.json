    "body": "Over dinner a few years ago, the late John Dingell, who served in the House of Representatives longer than anyone in history, described how Congress had changed during his career.<br />When he arrived in the House from Michigan in the 1950s, he said, members saw themselves as, first of all, representatives of their state, secondly as representatives of an institution (the House or the Senate), and only third as members of either the Democratic or Republican party. Nowadays, he said, the order has reversed: Lawmakers see themselves as members of a party first, and as representatives of their institution and their state only after that."
