    "body": "Sudan’s military leaders agreed to reinstate Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and allow him to form a technocratic government, nearly four weeks after ousting him in a coup that disrupted the country’s fragile transition to democracy, a group of local mediators said Sunday.<br />But the tentative deal—which was yet to be confirmed publicly by Mr. Hamdok and Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the top general who led the coup—was unlikely to end a deadly standoff between the military and pro-democracy protesters who have demanded an immediate move to civilian rule. Several leading protest groups on Sunday rejected any agreement with the military and said a demonstration planned for the afternoon was moving ahead."
