    "body": "It’s Mark Zuckerberg’s “metaverse,” we’re just living in it. Or so he hopes. The founder of  Facebook ,  now renamed Meta, “has long imagined a virtual world where people work, play and interact,” this newspaper recently reported. The company will throw billions of dollars, thousands of workers and years of effort at creating a new digital reality.<br />Although Mr. Zuckerberg has said he doesn’t expect the investments to pay off for years, he has already begun realizing his vision. The Journal reported in August that the company had “launched public testing of Horizon Workrooms, a free app used on its Oculus Quest 2 virtual-reality headset, that lets people enter virtual offices as avatars and participate in meetings while seeing their computer screen and keyboard.”"
