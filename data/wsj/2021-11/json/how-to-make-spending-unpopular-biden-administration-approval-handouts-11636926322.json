    "body": "The Biden Democrats may be achieving the impossible, which is making government spending unpopular. In March they passed $1.9 trillion in goodies, including $300  in monthly child allowances. This and other free lunches were supposed to be the ticket to keeping their majorities in Congress.<br />Then how to explain their collapse in the polls, which reached new lows in the latest ABC-Washington Post survey taken shortly after the $1 trillion infrastructure bill passed? President Biden’s job approval has sunk to 41%, and a Carteresque 39% on the economy—despite strong economic growth. Republicans have a 51% to 41% lead in which party-registered voters would prefer to control Congress."
