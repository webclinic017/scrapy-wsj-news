    "body": "Arizona Republican Congressman Paul Gosar said an anime video that appeared to show him attacking New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword wasn’t intended as a threat of violence against the congresswoman, but instead was a reference to the debate over immigration policy.<br />The video, which Mr. Gosar shared on Twitter and Instagram on Monday, also appeared to show how he was poised to attack President Biden​.   Twitter Inc .  had placed a disclaimer on the video, saying it violated its rules about hateful conduct. Instagram also put a warning on Mr. Gosar’s post, saying it “may contain graphic or violent content.” The video, which was produced by Mr. Gosar’s office, has since been deleted from both Twitter and Instagram."
