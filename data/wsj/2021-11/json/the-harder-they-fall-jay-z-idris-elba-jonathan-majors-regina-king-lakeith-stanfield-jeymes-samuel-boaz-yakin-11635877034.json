    "body": "‘The details of this story are fictional,” we’re told at the outset of “The Harder They Fall.” But be aware: “These. People. Existed.” (Punctuation theirs.) In other words, there may not have been a specific, real-life Black gunslinger who boasted “I’m lightnin’ with the blam-blams” or a blue-dyed elf who entertained, Josephine Baker-style, in a frontier cabaret. But the Wild West wasn’t as white as you might think it was.<br />That the actors Idris Elba, Jonathan Majors, Regina King and Lakeith Stanfield are playing inhabitants of the cinematic dry gulch constructed by director Jeymes Samuel (who co-wrote the screenplay with Boaz Yakin) is certainly noteworthy. So is the presence of rapper-entrepreneur Jay-Z as a producer (under his legal name, Shawn Carter). No less intriguing, given the level of gratuitous mayhem throughout, is the presence among the credits of Lawrence Bender, longtime producer-collaborator of Quentin Tarantino, even if “The Harder They Fall” seems less influenced by “Kill Bill” than by the Zapruder film."
