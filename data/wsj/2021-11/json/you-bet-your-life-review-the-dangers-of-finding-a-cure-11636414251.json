    "body": "In the fall of 1937, Joan Marlar, a 6-year-old girl in Tulsa, Okla., was diagnosed with strep throat and given an elixir containing a wondrous new medicine, sulfanilamide—an antibiotic hailed by Time magazine not long before as “the medical discovery of the decade.” Over the next week, Joan was racked with nausea; she became weak and tired. Her kidneys shut down, and she lapsed into a coma. Nine days after her diagnosis, she was dead.<br />The culprit: the medicine she had been given to cure her. The liquid used to dissolve the antibiotic, it turned out, had poisoned her kidneys. The manufacturer had never tested the product for safety—and at the time wasn’t legally obliged to do so. Prodded by this disaster, Congress passed a law in 1938 mandating the safety testing that might have saved Joan and the 104 other Americans who died from the toxic remedy."
