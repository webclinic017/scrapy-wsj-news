    "body": "The suggestion that the international Covax program could be improved in future pandemics by speeding up vaccine development, scaling up production and persuading donors and manufacturers to put self-interest aside fails to take into account the degree to which these considerations have featured in planning for the current one (“Getting Vaccines to the World the Next Time,” Review, Nov. 6).<br />The purpose of Covax was not for wealthy countries to subsidize poorer ones but to secure volume discounts through joint procurement and to minimize bilateral deals by locking in higher-income countries. The suggestion that trade in vaccines and ingredients has more or less gone uninterrupted belies the severe impact of India’s export restrictions."
