    "body": "If the donors to the rebuilding of Notre Dame in Paris had known what is now in store for its interior, would they have been so generous? And generous they have been. The fire of April 15, 2019, that destroyed the mighty roof and central spire has inspired what must be the world’s greatest act of collective cultural philanthropy. Over $940 million has already been collected from donors, some 340,000 in all, from all over the world.<br />What animated them was the promise that the cathedral would be re-created, exactly as it was, which was by no means a sure thing. Days after the fire Édouard Philippe, then French prime minister, declared that the cathedral would be rebuilt in a way “that bears the mark of our time.” Architects took him at his word: One proposal would have replaced the burned-out roof with an airy greenhouse, another with a municipal swimming pool. But if Photoshopped gags are the mark of our time, they had a positive effect. An outraged public demanded that the destroyed portions of the cathedral be rebuilt just as they were. So it was decreed, and early this year the process of selecting oak trees for the roof began."
