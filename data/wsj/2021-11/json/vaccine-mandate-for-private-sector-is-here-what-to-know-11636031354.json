    "body": "The Biden administration released a new regulation Thursday requiring workers at larger private-sector businesses to get vaccinated or undergo regular Covid-19 testing. The Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration is issuing the rule through an emergency temporary standard. Here’s what we know about how the mandate will work.<br />The Biden administration says workers at private-sector companies with at least 100 employees will need to get vaccinated or produce a negative Covid-19 test weekly. The administration estimates the rule will cover 84 million workers. It has separately required vaccinations for federal employees and federal contractors. More than 17 million workers must get vaccinated under a federal requirement for workers in health facilities that get Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement."
