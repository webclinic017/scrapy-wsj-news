    "body": "A new study shows how much the flows of money into and out of the stock market affect stock prices—perhaps more than many investors realize.<br />Specifically, a dollar of cash from outside the stock market that is invested in equities will cause the combined market cap of all stocks to rise by about $5, while a dollar withdrawn from the market will have the opposite “multiplier effect,” the study says."
