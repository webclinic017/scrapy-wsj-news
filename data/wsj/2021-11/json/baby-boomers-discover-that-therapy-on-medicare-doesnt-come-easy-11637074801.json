    "body": "Baby boomers seeking mental-health care are getting an unpleasant surprise when they turn 65: Finding a therapist who takes Medicare can be harder than finding one who takes private insurance.<br />That discovery came as a jolt to Janis Zimmermann. Ms. Zimmermann, 69 years old, had a long relationship with her psychologist. She hadn’t seen her for several years when she made an appointment last year seeking help to cope with the stress of caring for her disabled partner and her elderly parents. When Ms. Zimmermann, who retired from a job in land protection in Madison, Wis., arrived at her appointment, she was told that her therapist didn’t accept Medicare."
