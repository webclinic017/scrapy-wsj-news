    "body": "Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster has solid credentials as a military thinker and leader at the operational level of war, and he is perfectly correct in writing that political leaders can best reward patriots who fight for the country by ensuring that the outcome is a victory, not a defeat (“Honor Veterans by Having the Will to Win a War,” op-ed, Nov. 11).<br />But I fear that Mr. McMaster errs irremediably in his tacit premise that the U.S. armed forces, as they now exist, can win wars such as the one recently lost in Afghanistan. I refer to wars against insurgents, guerrillas, terrorists or bandits, indistinguishable from the local population at large, who do not require military equipment too large to be concealed."
