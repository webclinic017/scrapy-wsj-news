    "body": "SINGAPORE—In an unexpected twist to a case that has drawn international scrutiny over Singapore’s strict drug laws, the city-state’s highest appeals court stayed the execution of a mentally disabled man after he tested positive for Covid-19.<br />Nagaenthran Dharmalingam, a 33-year-old Malaysian national, appeared in court on Tuesday for a last-ditch appeal against his death sentence, which was scheduled for Wednesday morning. Before the appeal was heard, the judge said his execution would be stayed until further notice as his diagnosis precluded the completion of proceedings."
