    "body": "THE FIRST 18 MONTHS of the pandemic were especially productive for Mindy Kaling. “I was lucky I was pregnant for a big chunk of it,” said the Los Angeles-based producer, actor, writer and mother of two. “Having a baby makes everyone seem productive.”<br />Ms. Kaling, 42, was equally prolific when it came to Hollywood output. “I’m a writer. I had no distractions. So, that’s what I did.” She produced a second season of her  Netflix  high-school hit “Never Have I Ever,” with a third on the way. Also in the pipeline are a comedy about the L.A. Lakers and a Scooby-Doo spinoff series following the sleuthy and scientific Hanna-Barbera character Velma. (She voices a character on the Disney+ animated series “Monsters at Work” and is slated to voice Velma, too.)"
