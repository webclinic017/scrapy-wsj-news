    "body": "Hertz Global Holdings Inc.  unveiled a plan Monday to buy back as much as $2 billion of its stock, a move that would return more capital to investors who stood by the car-rental company through its bankruptcy filing last year.<br />Hertz shares rose about 1.5% Monday morning. The stock has traded lower since relisting on Nasdaq earlier this month, but is still well above the pandemic lows it hit when Hertz warned shareholders their holdings might go to zero."
