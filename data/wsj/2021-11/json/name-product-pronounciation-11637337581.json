Then it may be wise to consider this recent research finding: Consumers felt they had more control over products whose names were easier to pronounce.<br />In one study, researchers gave participants the exact same golf ball with four different made-up brand names: Machakw, Weayaya, Chatima and Melvern. Participants used the balls on a putting green, and then were asked to rate each ball on a seven-point scale, with 1 being difficult to control and 7 being easy to control."
