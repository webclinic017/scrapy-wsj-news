    "body": "Negative bond yields are getting harder to find in Europe, shrinking the pool of debt that pays back less to investors than they put in.<br />French, Irish, Dutch and Swiss yields have all either turned positive or flirted with the line in recent weeks and months. German 10-year bond yields, the regionâ€™s benchmark, are still negative, but rose as high as negative 0.07% this week, the closest they have come to turning positive since April 2019."
