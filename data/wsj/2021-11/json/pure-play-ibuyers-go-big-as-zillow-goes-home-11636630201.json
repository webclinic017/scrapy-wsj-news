    "body": "In the iBuying Hunger Games,  Opendoor Technologies  is winning just by virtue of survival. But when the risks are this high, investors should want the rewards to look a lot more appealing.<br />Following the home-flipping flop of  Zillow Group ,  one can choose to look at the iBuying industry as a runaway victory for Opendoor, which now owns a disproportionately large chunk of the Monopoly board, or a spectacular failure waiting to happen. Investors seem more disposed to the former view, sending shares of Opendoor up 15% after hours following its third-quarter financial results."
