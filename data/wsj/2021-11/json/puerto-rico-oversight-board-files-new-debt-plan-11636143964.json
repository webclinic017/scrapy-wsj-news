    "body": "A federal board overseeing Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy this week filed a new plan for restructuring the U.S. territory’s debt that preserves pension benefits for retired public-sector employees, a point of contention that had threatened to derail the debt-restructuring deal.<br />Hearings on the revised plan are scheduled to start Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Juan. Puerto Rico’s debt adjustment would reduce the island’s $33 billion in bonds and other debt to $7 billion in the largest-ever U.S. municipal bankruptcy case."
