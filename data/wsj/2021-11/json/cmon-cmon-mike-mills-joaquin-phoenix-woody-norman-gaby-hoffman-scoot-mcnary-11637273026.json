    "body": "If a carefully plotted, meticulously polished drama is what you’re after, you’ll want to pass on “C’mon C’mon.” If you’re up for going with the fascinating flow of a mercurial tale, this distinctive feature by Mike Mills may be just the ticket. (Literally so; it’s playing in select theaters.)<br />The production is framed as a road movie in which a radio journalist named Johnny (remarkable work by Joaquin Phoenix) reopens his closed-off self in the course of trying to cope with the comical whims and exasperating moods of his 9-year-old nephew, Jesse (Woody Norman, who is flat-out wonderful). The kid is whip smart, startlingly articulate and blissfully funny, but he’s all over the place in an unsettling way that defies description. My first impulse was to find the right word to describe it, and I remembered one that I must have encountered in a book about psychology. Jesse’s behavior is labile, an adjective that sounds precise but turns out to be little more than a clinical term for emotions that are all over the place."
