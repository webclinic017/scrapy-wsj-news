    "body": "Elon Musk should pay heed to Dan Molinski’s op-ed “When California Snatched My Paycheck” (Nov. 4). Mr. Musk, now a Texas resident, has lately sold nearly $7 billion in Tesla stock. California will soon send Mr. Musk a bill, taxing him on almost 85% of the gain from the sale. If he continues to sell stock, consistent with the result of his Twitter poll, he should expect a California tax bill of close to $3 billion.<br />California will say that the only reason his Tesla stock is worth anything is because Mr. Musk used to live there. It will ignore that Tesla’s stock has doubled in value since Mr. Musk left for the more fertile ground of Texas. California will claim that it is entitled to tax 85% of his gain because he spent 85% of his working time in the Golden State before selling his stock. California will not point Mr. Musk to a statute or regulation supporting its “working days” position, as it exists only as an administrative fiat of California’s Franchise Tax Board."
