    "body": "Rebounding economic activity and natural gas shortages recently pushed the developed worldâ€™s oil reserves to their lowest since early 2015, but growing crude supply could soon ease that pressure, the International Energy Agency said Tuesday.<br />In its closely watched monthly market report, the IEA said that the tight supply and demand balance in the global oil market could be about to ease.
