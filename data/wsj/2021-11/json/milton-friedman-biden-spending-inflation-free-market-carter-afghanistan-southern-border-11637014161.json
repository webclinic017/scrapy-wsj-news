    "body": "“Milton Friedman isn’t running the show anymore.”<br />So declared Joe Biden in an interview with Politico in April 2020, not long before he locked up the Democratic presidential nomination. The context was Mr. Biden’s ambitions for a stimulus that would be “a hell of a lot bigger” than the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill Donald Trump had signed. It was a curious way to invoke an economist who died 15 years ago Tuesday, but it appears to be Biden shorthand for his preference for big government action over market modesty."
