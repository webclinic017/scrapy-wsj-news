    "body": "Capt. Jerry Hendrix’s premise, that the Navy should prioritize attack aircraft over another new fighter, is spot-on (“The U.S. Navy’s Range Has Diminished Dangerously,” op-ed, Nov. 19). He suggests air refueling could mitigate fighter-range limitations, but it’s no panacea. China is equipping its fighters with long-range missiles that will force U.S. tankers to orbit at a distance beyond our fighters’ unrefueled radius.<br />With aircraft carriers pushed 1,500-2,000 miles from China to remain outside ballistic-missile range, pilots would face unsustainable 7-to-10-hour missions. They also wouldn’t have reliable divert basing in the absence of air refueling on their return legs. Put simply, U.S. fighters can’t reach China sustainably without putting tankers, carriers or themselves at prohibitive risk."
