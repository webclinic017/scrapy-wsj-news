    "body": "Senate Democrats led by New York Sen. Chuck Schumer made another push this week to federalize elections under H.R.4, but they might want to check with the New Yorkers who on Tuesday defeated two ballot measures on voting.<br />For months Democrats have been arguing that it’s too hard to get a ballot in America, so Congress must step in to keep the electorate from being suppressed. New Yorkers apparently don’t agree, since they soundly rejected two big ideas that Democrats want to impose on the whole nation via their other voting bill, H.R.1. The first is same-day voter registration. New York’s constitution says updates to the voter rolls “shall be completed at least ten days before each election.” A ballot measure to delete that provision failed, as of the latest numbers, 58% to 42%."
