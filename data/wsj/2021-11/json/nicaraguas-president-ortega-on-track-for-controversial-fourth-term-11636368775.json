    "body": "As expected, Nicaragua’s President Daniel Ortega had an overwhelming lead on his way to winning his fourth consecutive term, in an election that both the opposition and the U.S. said was a sham, completing his transformation into a 21st century version of the dynastic dictator he helped to overthrow over 40 years ago.<br />In the early hours of Monday, Brenda Rocha, the head of Nicaragua’s electoral authority said that with 65% of the vote counted, Mr. Ortega had won 75% of the vote. Five small satellite parties controlled by Mr. Ortega and nicknamed “zancudo” or mosquito parties, split the difference. Ms. Rocha said abstention had been 35%."
