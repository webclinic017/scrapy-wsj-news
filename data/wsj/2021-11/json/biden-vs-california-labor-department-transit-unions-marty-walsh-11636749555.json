    "body": "Here’s another reason for Democratic moderates to oppose the $4 trillion spending bill: It will give progressives more leverage to bully their states.

Gavin Newsom.<br />Labor recently informed California that its 2013 public pension reforms make it ineligible for some $12 billion in federal transit funds from the recently enacted infrastructure and March Covid bills. Yes, this is as crazy as it sounds."
