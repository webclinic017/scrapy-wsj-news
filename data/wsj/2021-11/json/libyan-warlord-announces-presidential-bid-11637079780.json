    "body": "Libya’s Khalifa Haftar said Tuesday that he plans run for president as the Russian-backed militia leader attempts to take political control of the entire country after a failed military campaign to seize the capital.<br />Mr. Haftar registered his candidacy in Benghazi, the country’s second-largest city and a stronghold for the military commander, whose militia forces control a swath of eastern Libya. His 14-month offensive to oust the internationally-recognized government in Tripoli ended in a United Nations-brokered truce last year."
