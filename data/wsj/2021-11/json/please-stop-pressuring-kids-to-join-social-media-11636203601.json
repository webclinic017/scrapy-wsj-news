    "body": "It’s hard enough to keep kids off social media when their friends all have accounts. But when the pressure comes from school clubs, sports teams and even churches, parental efforts to delay the leap can feel futile.<br />The convenience and popularity of group chats and social media have led many coaches, teachers, club supervisors and youth-group leaders to suggest kids join apps like Instagram, WhatsApp and Discord. It’s a tough situation when children become too old to have mom and dad handle every school and team communication, yet are still too young, in their parents’ eyes, for social media. Yet it’s not like kids are going to respond to email—or even read it."
