    "body": "WHEN THE CAR of the week is some six-figure personality disorder from Italy or Germany, I don’t worry too much about covering the practical details of ownership. The people who buy those cars aren’t what you’d call readers.<br />But this car, Lexus’s second generation NX compact crossover—our specimen, a plug-in hybrid called the NX 450h+—requires a fair bit of chalk talk, if not moral calculus. Based on the same gas-electric, all-wheel-drive watchworks as the Toyota RAV4 Prime, the swank little NX 450h+ is an energized bunny around suburbia, with a cuddly disposition and softly padded quickness more typical of premium battery-electrics—for as long as the 18.1-kWh battery pack holds out. Put a pin in that."
