    "body": "In 1985, when Roosevelt Montás first arrived in New York, he was an 11-year-old Dominican “with a head full of lice and a belly full of tropical parasites.” By his own account, he didn’t seem destined for a brilliant future and was “an unlikely candidate for the Ivy League.” Almost 40 years later, it’s clear that this wide-eyed immigrant has ended up blessing one particular Ivy League school as abundantly as it has blessed him.<br />The cover of “Rescuing Socrates” shows a marble statue of the philosopher improbably stuck in a plastic life preserver, a pop-art image that does little justice to this remarkable book. A better image would have been a photograph or drawing of a teenage boy on a busy street in Queens, N.Y., taking a volume of Plato from a stack of books thrown in the trash—because that is how young Mr. Montás first discovered the bedrock thinker of the Western philosophical tradition."
