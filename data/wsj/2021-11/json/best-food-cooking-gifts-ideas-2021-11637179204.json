Like they sing in the old TV commercial, “I’d like to buy the world a Coke, and keep it company”—only this year, make it a bottle of excellent Champagne and uncork it along with a generous serving of Swiss chocolates. Even the ice cubes in the cocktails should elicit cries of delight (let’s bring back that somewhat unfamiliar sound). The gifts assembled here aren’t necessarily expensive, but each one is rich in its own way. Keep the spirits high—not to mention flowing—and feed the jolly Falstaff in all your guests and giftees this holiday season.<br />One look at the tiger roaring on the label, and you know this drink will be fierce. Created by tiki expert Shannon Mustipher for the Livewire line of premixed drinks by bartenders, Holy Tyger is a dynamite whiskey sour that crackles with tropical personality, framed by lime, coconut and lemongrass. Unlike the meek canned spritzers that dominate ready-to-drink shelves, this bottle is a wholehearted, big, boozy endorsement of escapism and joie de vivre. Holy Tyger cocktail, $25 for a bottle that serves 6, livewiredrinks.com"
