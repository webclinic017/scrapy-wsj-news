    "body": "The bar is high these days for car makers announcing big-budget electric-vehicle strategies.<br />Nissan  shares fell 5.6% Monday after the company said it would invest almost $18 billion over five years to accelerate its EV rollout. Other Japanese auto stocks also fell—the Tokyo market needed to catch up with Friday’s stock-market rout—but Nissan was hit harder than its peers. It only has been six months since  Ford  published a comparable EV strategy, eliciting a euphoric reaction from Wall Street, but the party has moved on."
