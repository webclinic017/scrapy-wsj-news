    "body": "In the first three episodes of ‘Bad Bets,’ we’ve explored the sudden resignation of former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling and the financial engineering of former finance chief Andy Fastow. But Enron’s biggest problem was that its success was dependent on an image that was partly a facade. After Wall Street Journal reporters pulled back the curtain, it all came tumbling down.<br />In episode four, how Enron fell from Wall Street darling to bankruptcy in just a matter of weeks."
