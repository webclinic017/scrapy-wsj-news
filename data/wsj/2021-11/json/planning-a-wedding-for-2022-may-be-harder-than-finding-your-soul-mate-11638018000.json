    "body": "Couples still high on the euphoria of a new wedding engagement had better prepare themselves for a cold reality: Right now, finding the perfect life partner might be easier than planning the perfect wedding event.<br />Wedding planners and vendors across the U.S. report record numbers of inquiries and bookings through 2024 thanks to Covid-19 wedding postponements. According to projections from the wedding-planning website the Knot, an estimated 2.6 million weddings will take place in the U.S. in 2022, a record high. Around the same number of weddings have been set in 2021, leading to vendors and venues finding themselves overbooked and, in some cases, increasing prices."
