    "body": "Global financial regulators boosted capital requirements for JPMorgan Chase & Co.,  Goldman Sachs  Group Inc. and  BNP Paribas SA  under rules intended to help avoid a repeat of the 2008 global financial crisis, in which the largest lenders were deemed too big to fail.<br />The Financial Stability Board in Basel, Switzerland, said the three banks would be required to set aside a further 0.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital under rules for the world’s largest lenders—the so-called global systemically important banks, of which there are currently 30. The higher requirements become effective in January 2023, the FSB said in a statement Tuesday."
