    "body": "President Biden hightailed it out of the COP26 climate confab in Glasgow before the returns from Tuesday’s U.S. elections were in, and just as well. Talk about an embarrassment—for the entire global-summit-industrial complex as much as for Mr. Biden personally or his party back home.<br />Tuesday’s electoral rebuke to America’s Democrats caps a nine-month span in which one has often wondered for whom Mr. Biden speaks. He doesn’t represent half of his party, although it’s hard to tell from day to day whether the half he does represent is the far-left progressive wing or the centrist faction. Neither seems particularly happy with him."
