    "body": "WINTER TEMPERATURES in Winnipeg can plunge precipitously below freezing. Nonetheless, when venturing into subzero conditions, Andrew Mahon, 24, a photographer, wears a beanie rolled up high across his upper forehead, leaving his precious ears fully exposed. Mr. Mahon knows he’s being foolhardy: His mother has told him that “the tiny toque is one of the worst things that [he] started doing.” Parents, they just don’t understand. You see, Mr. Mahon exposes his ears for style. He feels a beanie that covers them “doesn’t exactly look that great…If cold ears are the worst thing that’s going to happen,” he said, “you know what? I’ll rock with it.”<br />Starting around October, you can catch men from Calgary to Costa Mesa self-consciously wearing beanies well above the ears (though some guys, defying all logic, adopt the look year round). “I’ve been wearing beanies like [this] since it turned 60 degrees,” said Ryan Rider, 25, a retail employee in Seattle who rests his ribbed caps almost flat across his head like a severed muffin top. He only reluctantly tugs the cap over his ears if the temperature drops below 30 or so degrees. A pulled-down beanie “just looks weird on me,” he said, giving about as thorough an answer for this affectation as I received."
