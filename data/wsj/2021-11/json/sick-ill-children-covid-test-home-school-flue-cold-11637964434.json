    "body": "Testing students exposed to Covid certainly allows them to return to class and avoid quarantine, but it should be the policy only for Covid-exposed asymptomatic children (“Schools Give Students Covid Tests Frequently to Keep Them in Class,” U.S. News, Nov. 16). Parents shouldn’t send symptomatic children with coughs, colds or congestion to school, even if they test negative for Covid.<br />Aside from Covid, many respiratory pathogens sicken school children, and by contagion, their parents, grandparents, siblings and friends. We are entering flu season and strep-throat season. Please keep all ill children home. Parents must be aware that a negative Covid swab in an ill child isn’t permission to send the child to school."
