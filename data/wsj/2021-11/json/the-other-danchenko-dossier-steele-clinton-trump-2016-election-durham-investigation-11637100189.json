    "body": "I gather numerous readers wanted more details about the secret Russian intelligence that influenced FBI Director James Comey’s interventions in the Hillary Clinton email case during the 2016 presidential election. I referred to this matter at length in Saturday’s column, without rehearsing the information, limited as it is, that became available in media reports almost five years ago.<br />If you remember anything from a flurry of press leaks in May 2017, a Russian document landed in Mr. Comey’s hands early in the 2016 race. It cited an alleged email exchange between Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, then head of the Democratic National Committee, and a George Soros-employed activist named Leonard Benardo."
