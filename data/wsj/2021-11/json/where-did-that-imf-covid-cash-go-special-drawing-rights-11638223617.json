    "body": "After a year of deliberation over how best to respond to the economic crisis caused by Covid-19, the International Monetary Fund announced in August a new general allocation of special drawing rights equivalent to $650 billion. SDRs are financial instruments that provide governments that are IMF shareholders access to hard currency. The IMF and World Bank normally impose strict transparency and reporting conditions on how funds may be used.<br />There were clear, negative, upfront consequences to any SDR allocation. SDRs must be distributed in proportion of IMF shareholding. All IMF members, even rogue nations, receive them, so Iran got some $5 billion and Belarus $1 billion. These windfalls undermine international efforts to use economic pressure to change these regimes’ bad behavior. The allocation added more than $17 billion to Russia’s record-high reserves, enhancing Moscow’s ability to absorb any international financial blowback arising from its decisions to choke off European gas supplies and amass troops on the Ukrainian border."
