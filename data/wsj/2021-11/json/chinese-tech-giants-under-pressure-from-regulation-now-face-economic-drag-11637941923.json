Social-media and videogaming giant  Tencent Holdings Ltd. ’s quarterly sales grew at their slowest pace since the company went public in 2004. Online delivery firm Meituan said growth of food delivery orders decelerated. Search-engine company  Baidu Inc.  reported a slowdown in advertising, while e-commerce giant  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  cut its growth forecast for the fiscal year."
