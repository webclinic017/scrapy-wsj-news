    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden’s China policy, a mix of confrontation and cooperation, will face a stress test when he meets virtually Monday evening with President Xi Jinping, as the leaders attempt to build on signs of easing hostility.<br />The bilateral conversation will be their third since Mr. Biden took office in January and comes as the Chinese leader extends his rule over the world’s most populous nation. The sides set modest expectations and don’t anticipate concrete outcomes. Broadly, Mr. Biden and his team have settled on a strategy of managing the relationship through what they call “intense diplomacy.”"
