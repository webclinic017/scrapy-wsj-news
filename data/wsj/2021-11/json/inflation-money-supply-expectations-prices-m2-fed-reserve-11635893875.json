    "body": "John Greenwood and Steve Hanke’s contention that excessive monetary growth is the cause of recent high inflation doesn’t hold water (“The Monetary Bathtub Is Overflowing,” op-ed, Oct. 22). Behind the 35.7% increase in M2 money supply that they cite—and attribute mainly to the Federal Reserve—lies $5.5 trillion of net spending power injected by the federal government. This was to offset the biggest short-term hit to aggregate demand in U.S. history. The Fed’s quantitative easing changes the form of the “money” (purchasing power) that deficits create, not the amount.<br />If monetary growth was the cause of the inflation, real personal consumption numbers would be rocketing, but they are barely back to pre-Covid trend. The consumer-price-index report reveals that big relative price shifts, notably for energy, food and vehicles, and base effects lie behind the rise in inflation. These are largely self-correcting in a matter of months, not years. Inflation worrywarts can sleep easy: If high inflation threatens to become persistent because the public’s inflation expectations shoot up, the Fed will counter with monetary tightening. Thanks to years of monetary easing, it has oodles of ammunition at the ready."
