    "body": "When the first European settlers arrived in America, huge flocks of wild passenger pigeons were observed in the skies. This phenomenon was initially documented in 1534 by the French explorer Jacques Cartier, who described the passage of a single flock as typically taking days to complete, largely obscuring the sun in the process. Successive mass slaughters, however, including one at Petoskey, Mich., in 1878, where approximately 50,000 birds were killed each day for nearly five months, reduced the passenger pigeon population from billions to none in a matter of a few decades. The last wild passenger pigeon was shot dead in Indiana in 1902.<br />In her thoughtful and entertaining “Life as We Made It: How 50,000 Years of Human Innovation Refined—and Redefined—Nature,” Beth Shapiro argues that humankind’s profound and protracted interventions have blurred the distinction between the natural and artificial worlds. There is a sense in which much of the natural world is no longer truly natural, it has been so extensively altered by human activities."
