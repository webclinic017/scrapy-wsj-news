    "body": "The metropolitan area of Detroit has around 1.7 million square feet of vacant office space. Surely there’s room for the Federal Highway Administration in all that. With only 41,000 people, Pine Bluff, Ark., has around 41,000 square feet of vacant commercial space. Couldn’t the headquarters of, say, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Business-Cooperative Service be squeezed in there somewhere?<br />Detroit has been in decline for decades, losing 65% of its population since 1950, and Pine Bluff is often named high on lists of declining towns. So why can’t the federal government move some of its operations to those cities?"
