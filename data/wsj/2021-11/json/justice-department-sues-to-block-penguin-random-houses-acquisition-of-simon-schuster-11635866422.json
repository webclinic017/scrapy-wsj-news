    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Justice Department filed a lawsuit Tuesday that seeks to block a major publishing industry deal in which Penguin Random House proposed to acquire rival Simon & Schuster for nearly $2.18 billion, the latest in a series of aggressive antitrust cases brought under the Biden administration.<br />The department, in a lawsuit filed in a Washington, D.C. federal court, alleged the deal would let Penguin Random House—already the world’s largest consumer book publisher as measured by revenue—exert outsize influence over which books are published in the U.S. and how much authors are paid."
