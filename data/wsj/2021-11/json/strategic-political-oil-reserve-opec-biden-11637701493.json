    "body": "Crude prices rose Tuesday after the Biden Administration announced that the U.S. and other countries would tap their petroleum reserves. Sorry, Mr. President. Markets know that this political gesture wonâ€™t fix the supply shortage and could make it worse.<br />The Energy Department next month will begin releasing 50 million barrels from the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve (SPR), the first major release since the Libyan conflict in 2011. Congress already requires that some 18 million barrels are to be sold to raise revenue, and the other 32 million will be returned to the reserve when prices drop. China, India, Japan, South Korea and the U.K. will also make modest drawdowns."
