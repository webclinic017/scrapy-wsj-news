    "body": "As more companies use humanlike chatbots, they need to be aware of a big risk: They may be alienating their most unsatisfied customers.<br />New research that I have conducted with my colleagues at the University of Oxford—Felipe Thomaz, Rhonda Hadi and Andrew Stephen—reveals that making chatbots more humanlike is a double-edged sword. On one hand, when customers are neutral, happy or even sad, interacting with humanized chatbots can boost customer satisfaction. Yet, when customers are angry, interacting with humanized chatbots only increases their dissatisfaction, meaning that a company’s most unsatisfied customers are often handled the most poorly."
