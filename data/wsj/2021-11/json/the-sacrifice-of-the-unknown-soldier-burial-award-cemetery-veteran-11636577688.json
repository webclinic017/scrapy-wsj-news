    "body": "Thursday marks the 100th anniversary of the interment of the unidentified World War I serviceman who lies at rest in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery. Though not often remembered these days, the interment was a massive event. Hundreds of thousands thronged Washington to witness the solemn procession of the casket from the Capitol to the cemetery. For all its pomp and gravity, however, the day could not begin to predict the role the tomb would come to play in binding and healing the nation.<br />In 1921 the concept of an “unknown soldier” was new. Every battle throughout history has produced unidentifiable dead, typically gathered in mass graves and buried with little ceremony. But what happened that day a century ago in Washington was different."
