    "body": "How the mighty have fallen—and perhaps will rise again. On Tuesday General Electric CEO Larry Culp announced a split-up of its aviation, healthcare and energy units, capping two decades of market decline. Markets can be unforgiving, but they are the best allocators of capital.<br />“By creating three industry-leading, global public companies, each can benefit from greater focus, tailored capital allocation, and strategic flexibility to drive long-term growth and value for customers, investors, and employees,” Mr. Culp said in announcing the separation of assets. At least that’s the hope. Shareholders cheered the breakup by driving  GE ’s  stock price up 2.65%."
