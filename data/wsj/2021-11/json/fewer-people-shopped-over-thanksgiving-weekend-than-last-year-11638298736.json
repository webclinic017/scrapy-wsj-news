    "body": "Fewer U.S. consumers made purchases during the Thanksgiving weekend for the second straight year, as more shoppers began their holiday shopping early and smaller discounts gave them less incentive to spend.<br />Roughly 180 million Americans went shopping in stores or online between Thursday and Monday, the National Retail Federation reported, compared with 186.4 million in 2020 and 189.6 million in 2019. The NRF, a retail trade group, based its estimates on a consumer survey done in partnership with Prosper Insights & Analytics."
