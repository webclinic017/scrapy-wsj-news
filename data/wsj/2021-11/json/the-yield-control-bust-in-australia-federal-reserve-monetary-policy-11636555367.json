    "body": "The Federal Reserve appears to have abandoned its discussion of yield-curve control, but bad monetary ideas have a way of returning. So it’s worth memorializing the failure of this experiment in Australia.<br />Yield-curve control is a policy by which the central bank sets an explicit interest-rate peg at one or more points along the yield curve. It’s supposed to lend more precision and credibility to policy since authorities can tell investors what rates “should” be, in contrast to tools with which central banks manipulate the quantity of money and then hope for the best on rates. With a rate target, the central bank doesn’t have to expand its balance sheet by buying assets unless markets decide to test the peg."
