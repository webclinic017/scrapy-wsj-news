    "body": "Is anyone surprised that international climate politics is no different from domestic climate politics? (“The Climate Summit to Nowhere,” Review & Outlook, Oct. 30). In developed nations, people profess to desire drastic emissions cuts—so long as they don’t have to pay for them. Large majorities believe climate change to be a concern. Yet only a little more than half of Americans say they would pay an extra $1 a month to fight it and even fewer, 28%, would pay $10 a month.<br />World leaders know this and contort themselves accordingly. Congress wants the wealthy and corporations to pick up the tab. Authoritarians in China and Russia need economic growth to remain in power; they are unlikely to commit to anything substantive. Many emerging countries appropriately feel it unfair that their growth be stymied by taking away fuels that wealthier countries used to get rich. As a result, climate summits become an exercise in devising the most indirect means to reach vaguely defined objectives."
