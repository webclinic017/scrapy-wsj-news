    "body": "It is a remarkable fact that American transcendentalism’s two best-known authors—Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau—lived within walking distance in the same small village of 2,000 souls. Like the Renaissance London of Shakespeare and Marlowe or the mid-20th-century Liverpool of Lennon and McCartney, antebellum Concord, Mass., was a surprising hub of genius, a confluence of talent that defies easy explanation.<br />The two men’s writings—a significant portion of what we call transcendentalism—remain some of the most important literary and philosophical statements in United States history. Transcendentalism was a heady mixture of European Romanticism and Enlightenment theology, born of dissatisfaction with the materialistic and increasingly industrialized culture of antebellum America. Its insistence on the inherent capacities of each individual—on the divinity within shared by all people—led to its antipathy toward any social institution that prevented people from realizing those capacities. And its optimistically rebellious impulse has remained durable now for nearly two centuries."
