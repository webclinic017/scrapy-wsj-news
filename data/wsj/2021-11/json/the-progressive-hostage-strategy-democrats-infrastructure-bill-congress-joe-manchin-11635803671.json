    "body": "Democrats want to vote this week on a pair of epic tax and spending bills, yet they’re still playing hide-the-ball on their multi-trillion-dollar reconciliation bill. It’s clearer than ever that the Democrats and Republicans who want to vote for the $1 trillion Senate infrastructure bill are being taken for a ride.<br />House progressives blocked a vote on the infrastructure bill for a second time last week, and again they did it with President Biden’s blessing. Multiple news reports say the White House gave Rep. Pramila Jayapal, head of the Progressive Caucus, the go-ahead to overrule Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s desire to vote on infrastructure before Mr. Biden left for Europe. Mrs. Pelosi had to pull the bill for a second humiliating time."
