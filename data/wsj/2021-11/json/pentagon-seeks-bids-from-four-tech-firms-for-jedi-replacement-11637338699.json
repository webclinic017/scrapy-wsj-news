    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Pentagon said Friday that it has issued formal solicitations to four major technology companies— Amazon.com Inc.  and  Microsoft Corp. , as well as  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google and  Oracle Corp. —for a multibillion-dollar cloud-computing contract to replace the ill-starred JEDI procurement, which became mired in litigation and a torrent of objections from Congress.<br />The outcome represents a win for all the companies, but particularly for Amazon, which lost the competition for the original JEDI contract to Microsoft in a surprise outcome. Amazon later complained in court that the original award to Microsoft was the result of political meddling by then-President Donald Trump, a charge the Pentagon denied."
