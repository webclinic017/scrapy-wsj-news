    "body": "Facebook  said it is shutting down its facial-recognition system in the coming weeksâ€”scrapping a feature that has developed into a central element of photo-sharing online, but raised concerns among privacy advocates and regulators.<br />People who have opted into the service will no longer be automatically recognized in video and photo content, according to Jerome Pesenti, vice president of artificial intelligence at Meta Platforms Inc., formerly Facebook Inc.  He said the social-media platform would also delete individual facial recognition templates for over one billion people."
