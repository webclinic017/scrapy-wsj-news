    "body": "I agree with your editorial “A Banking Regulator Who Hates Banks” (Oct. 25) that the Senate should not defer to the president regarding his pick for the office of comptroller of currency, Saule Omarova. As a fellow female immigrant from the former U.S.S.R., I oppose her nomination not out of misogyny or xenophobia but because I know that progressives are whitewashing Ms. Omarova’s past and the Soviet reality that she, I and millions of others lived.<br />Her tale of being stranded in the U.S. as an exchange student by the collapse of the Soviet Union doesn’t match my experience. When the U.S.S.R. fell apart, I too was in the U.S. on a visa: I simply returned to my old home, now in newly independent Lithuania, just as she could have returned to newly independent Kazakhstan."
