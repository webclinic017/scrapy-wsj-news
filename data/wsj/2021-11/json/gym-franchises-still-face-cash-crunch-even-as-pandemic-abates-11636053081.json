    "body": "24 Hour Fitness Worldwide, Inc. and Equinox Holdings Inc. are pursuing out-of-the-box ways to raise cash from investors, as the gym franchises manage through a prolonged downturn catalyzed by the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />After burning through much of its cash this year, 24 Hour Fitness in October agreed to borrow up to $70 million in a transaction that will help the company fund its operations into next year, according to people familiar with the matter. The company didnâ€™t project that it would need additional capital when it exited bankruptcy late last year, according to court filings."
