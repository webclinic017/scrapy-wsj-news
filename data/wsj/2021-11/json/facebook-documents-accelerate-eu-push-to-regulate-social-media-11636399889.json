    "body": "European officials are seizing on disclosures from  Facebook  whistleblower Frances Haugen to accelerate and sharpen their plans to impose sweeping new restrictions on big technology companies.<br />After a series of meetings with Ms. Haugen, policy makers and lawmakers for the European Union said that the bloc must move quickly to toughen and enact measures in a bill proposed last year that would impose stiffer obligations on social-media services. The bill, as currently drafted, would require large tech platforms to actively look for and mitigate risks from content that is illegal, or face hefty fines."
