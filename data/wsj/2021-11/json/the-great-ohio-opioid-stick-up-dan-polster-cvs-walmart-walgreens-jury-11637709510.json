    "body": "Thousands of local governments and plaintiff attorneys are seeking to extort companies in the drug supply chain by holding them liable for the nationâ€™s opioid epidemic. Now armed with a jury verdict, a federal judge is holding  Walgreens ,   Walmart  and CVS hostage to a settlement.<br />That sums up the news on Tuesday that a jury in a bellwether case in Ohio has found the three large pharmacy chains liable for creating a public nuisance by filling opioid prescriptions. The companies say they plan to appeal, but they will have to wait until federal Judge Dan Aaron Polster, who presides over the consolidated cases, issues a separate ruling on damages."
