    "body": "Good timing. On the same day we told you about the abuse of “public nuisance” theory in opioid lawsuits, the Oklahoma Supreme Court tossed a $465 million judgment against  Johnson & Johnson  for allegedly creating a nuisance by manufacturing prescription opioids. Congratulations to J&J, a rare corporation that had the courage to fight back against this abusive litigation.<br />Former GOP Attorney General Mike Hunter, aided by campaign donors in the plaintiffs bar, sued J&J as well as Purdue Pharma and Teva Pharmaceuticals in 2017. The state demanded that the companies cough up tens of billions of dollars to “abate” the alleged public nuisance created by making and selling opioids."
