    "body": "There is a fair chance toys and gifts will be stuck in container ships this holiday season. That’s bad news for nearly everyone—but not for  Etsy .<br />The crafts-focused online marketplace brought in $3.1 billion in gross merchandise sales in the third quarter, a 17.9% increase compared with a year earlier, including some recent acquisitions, and coming in above Wall Street expectations. Net income was $89.9 million, also above expectations, even with the additional expenses Etsy incurred when it acquired Gen-Z-targeted used-clothing seller Depop for $1.6 billion and Brazilian marketplace Elo7 for $217 million. The two acquisitions closed during the third quarter."
