    "body": "WASHINGTON—The launch of the Affordable Care Act’s open enrollment Monday will test whether more generous financial assistance to consumers helps President Biden reach his goal of boosting coverage by building on the health law.<br />Many consumers will see lower prices because Congress passed a $1.9 trillion coronavirus-aid bill in March that provided larger premium subsidies and made more people eligible for them. Democrats are now negotiating to preserve the expanded subsidies, which are set to end next year, in Mr. Biden’s social-spending and climate bill."
