    "body": "When the Soviet Union fell apart three decades ago, Western leaders were at first deeply worried about the sudden disintegration of a vast, nuclear-armed state, foreseeing new threats and dangers. Soon enough, they came to understand the collapse in a different way—as the triumph of liberal values over dictatorship. For Vladimir Putin, by contrast, it was “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.” At least no one disputes its momentous significance.<br />Naturally, the literature on the Soviet breakup is vast. It includes incisive chronicles by historians such Serhii Plokhii and Stephen Kotkin and by diplomats such as Jack Matlock, the former U.S. ambassador to Moscow. There are also biographical studies of Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader and the central figure in this drama. With “Collapse: The Fall of the Soviet Union,” the Moscow-born historian Vladislav Zubok, a professor at the London School of Economics, adds his voice to the chorus of narrative and analysis. He uses archival material—along with interviews and memoirs—to construct a compelling account."
