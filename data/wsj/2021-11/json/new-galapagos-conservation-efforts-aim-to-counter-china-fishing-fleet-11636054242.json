But enforcement is likely to be a challenge.<br />Under a plan announced Tuesday, the governments of Ecuador, Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica said the famed Galápagos Islands would be united via a marine corridor with Colombia’s Malpelo Island and the Cocos and Coiba islands off Central America. The goal is to mark off a stretch of ocean twice the size of Arizona as off-limits to industrial fishing."
