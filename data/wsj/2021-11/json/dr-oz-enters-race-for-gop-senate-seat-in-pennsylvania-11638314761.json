    "body": "Celebrity surgeon Mehmet Oz filed paperwork Tuesday to run for an open Senate seat in Pennsylvania, further scrambling a crowded GOP primary field in a state that could determine which party wins control of the Senate in next year’s midterm elections.<br />Mr. Oz’s entry into the race to replace retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey comes shortly after former President Donald Trump’s pick for the state’s GOP nomination, former Army Ranger Sean Parnell, suspended his campaign. Mr. Parnell pulled out of the competition following a judge’s ruling to award primary legal custody of his three children to his estranged wife, Laurie Snell. She had made allegations of abuse that Mr. Parnell denied."
