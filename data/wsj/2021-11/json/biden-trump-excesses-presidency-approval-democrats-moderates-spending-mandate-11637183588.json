    "body": "The hardest thing to believe about Joe Biden is that his presidency is less than a year old. It feels like forever.<br />Until 2024, the options available for dazed and confused Americans are: a) keep voting when they get the chance, or b) answer the phone when pollsters call. The results so far of this rolling referendum are 40 miles of bad road for the Biden Democrats."
