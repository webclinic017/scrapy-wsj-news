    "body": "The U.S. economy faces multiple challenges. The recovery has been more rapid than expected but now there’s an acute inflation problem. At the same time, the economy suffers from chronic problems, including underinvestment in children, insufficient support for working parents, and the threat of climate change. Addressing inflation is imperative, especially through less-expansionary monetary policy. But Congress must also address the chronic problems by passing the Build Back Better bill.<br />The current inflation has many causes, including a post-pandemic reallocation of labor, a spending shift from services to goods, lingering supply-chain disruptions, and rising global oil and gas prices. These international factors don’t tell the whole story. Inflation in the U.S. was similar to what the euro area experienced going into the pandemic, but prices have risen a cumulative 4% more in the U.S. over the past two years."
