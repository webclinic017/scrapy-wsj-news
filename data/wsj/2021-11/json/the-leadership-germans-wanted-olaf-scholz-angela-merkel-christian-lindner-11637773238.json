    "body": "Germans declined to endorse any one politician, party or platform in their election in September—and that’s the government they’re getting in the coalition agreement unveiled Wednesday. Europe’s largest economy will be led by a consortium of Social Democrats, Greens and free-market Free Democrats, and don’t ask where they’re heading.<br />The new chancellor to replace Angela Merkel will be Olaf Scholz, leader of the center-left Social Democratic party (SPD) and finance minister in Ms. Merkel’s administration. His relative success in the September poll, reviving a party many had written off after a poor showing in 2017, was built on a perception he’d deliver a little change after the Merkel era but not too much. The coalition agreement he’s crafted confirms that perception."
