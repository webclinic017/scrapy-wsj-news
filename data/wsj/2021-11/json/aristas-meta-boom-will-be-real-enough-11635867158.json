    "body": "It remains to be seen whether Mark Zuckerberg’s metaverse fantasies will become reality, but the social-network founder’s metamorphosis already seems to be a dream come true for  Arista Networks .<br />The network-equipment maker projected a major jump in business next year during an analyst meeting late Monday. Arista said it expects revenue to grow about 30% in 2022—far above the 13% pace that analysts had been expecting. Arista didn’t cite the company once known as Facebook as the reason for the uplift, but  Meta Platforms  has been second only to  Microsoft  among Arista’s largest customers over the past two years. The forecast came just a week after  Facebook  surprised Wall Street by projecting a 66% jump in capital expenditures for 2022."
