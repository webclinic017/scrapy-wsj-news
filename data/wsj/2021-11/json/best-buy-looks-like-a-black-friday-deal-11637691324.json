    "body": "High expectations can spoil a perfectly good early holiday gift.<br />Best Buy  shares fell by more than 16% at one point Tuesday morning despite beating Wall Streetâ€™s estimates for the quarter ended Oct. 30. Comparable sales grew 1.6% instead of the expected 0.2% decline. That growth is nothing to sneeze at considering that the retailer saw a 23% jump this time last year."
