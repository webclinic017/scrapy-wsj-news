    "body": "Daniel Levin’s “Proof of Life,” a riveting true story, begins with a plea for help before barreling down a winding tunnel of facts and rumors. An acquaintance has asked Mr. Levin to assist in locating a friend’s son, who has gone missing. The man, in his mid-20s, entered Syria as a volunteer with a medical organization, and hasn’t been heard from in two months. The news of his disappearance has not been made public and the true nature of his activities in Syria isn’t entirely clear.<br />Mr. Levin agrees to help, and over the course of 20 days travels through the Middle East in search of the missing man. In Amman, he meets a duo who might be connected to the possible kidnapper but want a million dollars to provide an introduction. In Beirut, he has an unlikely encounter with a sheikh (whom he does not name, but whose identity may be obvious to casual observers of Middle Eastern politics). And in Dubai, the author tracks down the ex-wife of the suspected kidnapper; her desire for revenge against her former husband motivates her to help Mr. Levin. It is a race against time, as the author scrambles to ascertain whether the young man is still alive and, if so, how he might be gotten out."
