    "body": "A Louisiana board began the process of pardoning Homer Plessy, the civil rights pioneer whose challenge of racial segregation laws was rebuffed by the 1896 Supreme Court decision that instead enshrined the doctrine of “separate but equal.”<br />The Louisiana Board of Pardons unanimously approved an application to pardon Mr. Plessy, and the decision now rests with Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards. A representative for Mr. Edwards, a Democrat, said he was traveling Friday “but looks forward to receiving and reviewing” the recommendation."
