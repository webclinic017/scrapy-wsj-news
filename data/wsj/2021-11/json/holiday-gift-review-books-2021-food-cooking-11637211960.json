    "body": "As Thanksgiving looms, filling many home cooks with dread, it’s worth repeating what the writer Laurie Colwin had to say on the subject. In “The Family Dinner in Real Life,” she lays the blame for our anxiety at the feet of the painter Norman Rockwell: “I myself am reduced to worm size when contemplating his famous illustration of the farm family Thanksgiving table, with the beaming grandparents and the children with their hair combed. How happy they all look! And how politely and still the children sit!” Contemplating this enchanting Thanksgiving picture, she wonders: “Why do I suspect that the grandfather drinks more than he should, that the mother and father have had a few bitter words in the kitchen about the in-laws, or the mom has told the dad how much she resents doing all the cooking when all he has done is watch the football game and never so much as poke his head into the kitchen to ask if she needed help, and that the aunt is taking either antidepressants or mood elevators?”<br />Colwin’s humor calms you down. It’s a treat to read her classic cookbook-memoirs,“Home Cooking” and “More Home Cooking,” which have just been reissued. She writes in a breezy conversational style as if she were an old friend giving you sensible advice. I can imagine her coming into my kitchen, lightly slapping away my hand from the chopping board and taking over: This is how to do it."
