    "body": "The Beijing Stock Exchange opened for trading Monday, marking the debut of a venue that China hopes will channel funds into innovative smaller companies, as it tightens its grip on companies seeking listings overseas.<br />The new exchange in the Chinese capital complements stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen, mainland Chinaâ€™s main financial centers. It also builds on an existing over-the-counter market in Beijing called the National Equities Exchange and Quotations, or NEEQ, which is sometimes known as the New Third Board."
