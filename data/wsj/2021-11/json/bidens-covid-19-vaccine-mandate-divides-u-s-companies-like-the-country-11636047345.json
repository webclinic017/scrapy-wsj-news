    "body": "The Biden administration’s Covid-19 vaccination and testing requirements for larger employers drew mixed reaction from executives, with some saying the new rules simplified their roles, while others raised concerns about costs, logistical challenges and the threat of workers leaving.<br />Brian Fielkow said the Houston trucking and logistics company that he runs would comply with the rules, though he expected complications. Mr. Fielkow, chief executive of Jetco Delivery, said he has spent months encouraging his workforce to get inoculated, though a number of employees have a deep-seated resistance to it. Weekly testing could add additional costs and create other administrative difficulties, particularly for truck drivers and others who don’t spend much of their time in a central location, he said."
