    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell criticized a Biden administration offer to pay immigrant families that were separated after illegally crossing the southern border during the Trump administration around $450,000 a person to settle lawsuits alleging psychological trauma.<br />“Honestly, this absurd idea feels like a satirical policy proposal that Republicans would have invented to make a parody out of the radical left,” Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor Monday afternoon, echoing other Republican criticism and previewing a likely line of attack in next year’s midterm elections."
