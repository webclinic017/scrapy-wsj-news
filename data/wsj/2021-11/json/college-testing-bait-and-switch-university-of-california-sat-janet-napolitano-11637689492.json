    "body": "When the University of California moved to drop the SAT and ACT from its admissions process on social-justice grounds last year, the school tempered its decision by saying it would design a replacement to protect academic standards. President Janet Napolitano said the university was “developing a new test that more closely aligns with what we expect incoming students to know to demonstrate their preparedness for UC.”<br />So much for that. At last week’s Board of Regents meeting, the university officially abandoned the search for a new standardized test. “We reached a conclusive decision that there isn’t right now a test or an assessment that we feel comfortable using in our admissions process,” said the board chair, according to the Times of San Diego."
