    "body": "Progressives say the only way to achieve their climate goals is to raise the price of fossil fuels. Their problem is that consumers don’t want to pay more for energy, and as the latest proof behold Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont’s retreat this week from a Northeast state climate pact.<br />Last December the Governors of Rhode Island, Connecticut and Massachusetts and the mayor of Washington, D.C., joined a cap-and-trade scheme to reduce carbon emissions from fuel. Wholesalers and distributors would have to buy emissions credits at auction. The proceeds would be sent to the states to spend on electric vehicles, public transportation and “climate justice.”"
