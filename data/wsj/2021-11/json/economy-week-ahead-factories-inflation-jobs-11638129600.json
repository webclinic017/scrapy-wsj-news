    "body": "The U.S. employment report for November highlights this week’s economic data. Economists, analysts and investors are also closely tracking the fast-spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus to determine its impact on health and the broader economy.<br />China’s factory activity might contract for a third straight month in November as the country’s unprecedented property curbs together with persistently high raw-material prices soften demand. The market expects China’s official manufacturing purchasing manager’s index to come in below 50 in November, the mark that separates contraction from expansion. China’s sprawling manufacturing sector has slowed this year due to power shortages, factory-gate inflation and a downturn in the real-estate market that has spilled over into investment and construction."
