    "body": "Tesla Inc .  Chief Executive Elon Musk said the electric-vehicle maker hasn’t signed a deal with  Hertz Global Holdings Inc .  yet, which appeared to contradict a Hertz announcement late last month that the company was ordering 100,000 Teslas.<br />“I’d like to emphasize that no contract has been signed yet,” Mr. Musk said in a tweet late Monday. “Tesla has far more demand than production, therefore we will only sell cars to Hertz for the same margin as to consumers. Hertz deal has zero effect on our economics,” he said."
