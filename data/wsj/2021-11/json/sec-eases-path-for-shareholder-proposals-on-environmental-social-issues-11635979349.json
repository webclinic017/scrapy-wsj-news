    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Securities and Exchange Commission reversed a Trump-era policy and acted Wednesday to streamline the process for shareholders to propose resolutions on environmental or social issues during the coming proxy season.<br />The SEC rescinded guidance that since 2017 helped company managers to exclude some shareholder proposals from their annual proxy statements. The change reflects the agency’s emphasis on so-called shareholder democracy under Chairman Gary Gensler, a Democrat tapped by President Biden. It also comes as deadlines for proposals in the 2022 proxy season are approaching in coming weeks."
