    "body": "Two Federal Reserve governors opened the door on Friday to the possibility the central bank could move more swiftly to end its asset-buying stimulus effort.<br />“The economy is in a very strong position” and “there is upside risk to inflation,” Federal Reserve vice chairman Richard Clarida said in a virtual appearance. When it comes to the possibility of speeding up the drawdown in the Fed’s bond-buying stimulus effort, “I’ll be looking closely at the data that we get between now and the December meeting, and it may well be appropriate at that meeting to have a discussion about increasing the pace” of the pullback in asset buying at the coming Federal Open Market Committee meeting, he said."
