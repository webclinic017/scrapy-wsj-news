    "body": "Kudos to Faith Bottum for addressing a solvable problem in Washington (“When Federal Employees Telecommute, Why Are Agencies in D.C.?” op-ed, Nov. 27). The culture of the capital has worsened in recent years, with lawyers moving from agency to agency but maintaining a single belief: All good ideas originate in Washington and the rubes in the hinterland have to be ruled, not consulted. That conceit would be undermined if, say, the Securities and Exchange Commission were located in Chicago or the Federal Trade Commission in Denver.<br />Tim Kelly"
