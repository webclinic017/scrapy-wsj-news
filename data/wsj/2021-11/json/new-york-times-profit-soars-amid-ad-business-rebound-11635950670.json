    "body": "New York Times Co.  said net profit rose by 63% in the third quarter, boosted by a strong rebound in advertising revenue, but warned that the end of a one-year promotional-pricing offer ahead of last year’s presidential election would pressure subscriber growth in the coming quarter.<br />The Times said it signed up 455,000 new digital subscribers in the quarter, 320,000 of which were for its core news offering and 135,000 were for lower-cost digital products such as its games, cooking and Wirecutter, the company’s product-review site."
