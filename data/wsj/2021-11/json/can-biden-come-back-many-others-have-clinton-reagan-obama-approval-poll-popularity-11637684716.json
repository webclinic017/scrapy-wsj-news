    "body": "The new president was in trouble. After a fast start on his legislative agenda, his job approval declined through the first and second years of his administration. Inflation was uncomfortably high, and the public’s mood about the economy had soured.<br />In the midterms, the president’s party suffered large losses in the House. As the third year of his presidency began, his job approval had sunk to 35%, and a national poll conducted later that month found him trailing his principal opponent for the presidency by 9 points."
