    "body": "LAST YEAR, facing a somber holiday season, we told our gift guide readers to resist “lizard-covered cocktail spoons” and other “silly” fare. This year…well, we’re still not quite ready to bring on the reptilian flatware, but concepts like whimsy, fun and a little impracticality seem apropos again. Our discerning editors have rounded up 47 gift ideas under $300—from modern cuckoo clocks and bulldog-shaped ice cubes to a deconstructed  BlackBerry  amusingly memorialized in a frame—that strike the right note for a decidedly more festive, optimistic Noel.<br />There’s something for every kind of giftee here, from bakers to backpackers to beauty buffs. We’ve split the presents into five categories: fashion, design, food, gear and travel. (And if the holiday spirit is truly loosening your purse strings, we’ve thrown in five splurge-worthy, big-ticket items, too.)"
