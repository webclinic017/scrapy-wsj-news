    "body": "Israel’s Foreign Minister Yair Lapid flew to Manama, Bahrain, in September to open the new Israeli Embassy, where he stated, “May our people live in peace and prosperity forever.” The ceremony was proof that last year’s Abraham Accords continue to foster peace and prosperity.<br />Mr. Lapid’s trip, the first by an Israeli foreign minister to Bahrain, showed the emerging Arab and Israeli determination to unite against the threat of Iran. As Mr. Lapid said: “Our opportunities are shared. Our threats are also shared, and they aren’t far from here.”"
