    "body": "The Federal Trade Commission is seeking information from  Amazon.com Inc.,   Procter & Gamble Co. ,  Walmart Inc.  and others about how they are handling supply-chain snarls, part of a study into whether the problems have led to anticompetitive behavior and higher prices.<br />The document request isnâ€™t part of any law-enforcement action, the FTC said in a press release. Instead, the agency said it is looking to understand the reasons behind the widespread supply-chain problems that have crimped economic growth."
