    "body": "Over the summer, Royal Philips NV set off a scramble among sleep apnea sufferers when it recalled millions of machines that many use to breathe at night, citing concerns that the foam in the devices could pose a health risk.<br />Last week, users were thrown another curveball when the Food and Drug Administration warned the replacement machines that the Dutch health giant has been cranking out since September may be harmful, too. The FDA didnâ€™t order a recall of some 250,000 replacement devices Philips has sent to users, but said it was concerned that a silicone-based foam used in the substitute devices could emit harmful gases. That has raised new questions among users about what to do."
