    "body": "As governor of Pennsylvania, I am disappointed the Journal would publish former President Donald Trump’s irrational array of discredited lies about the November 2020 election in our commonwealth (Letters, Oct. 28.)<br />Pennsylvania had a free, fair and secure election. Claims of voter fraud and rigged elections are completely false and have been repeatedly debunked by fact checkers and dismissed by dozens of state and federal judges as well as Trump administration officials, most notably former Attorney General Bill Barr."
