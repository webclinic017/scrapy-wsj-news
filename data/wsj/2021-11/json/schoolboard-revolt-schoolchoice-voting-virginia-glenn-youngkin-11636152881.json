    "body": "Glenn Youngkin’s use of the education issue to win the Virginia Governor’s race is getting most of the media attention, but less well known is that Tuesday saw a parental revolt against school boards in many parts of the country.<br />Voters flipped the school board in Douglas County, Colo., with the election of four candidates focused on parental and student rights who ran under the Vote4KidsFirst slate. “A lot of issues at the forefront of this race revolved around [critical race theory] and Covid, but the best way to sum it all up is that Parents need a seat at the table when it comes to the education and well being of their children,” campaign manager Holly Osborne Horn told us in an email."
