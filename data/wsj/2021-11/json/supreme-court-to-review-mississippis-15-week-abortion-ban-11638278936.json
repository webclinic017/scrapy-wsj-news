    "body": "WASHINGTON—Mississippi will ask the Supreme Court at Wednesday arguments to overrule Roe v. Wade and eliminate the constitutional right women have held since 1973 to end unwanted pregnancies.<br />The case provides the first direct test of former President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign prediction that if he got the opportunity to make two or three appointments to the Supreme Court, Roe “automatically” would be overruled. Three Trump appointees—two of whom succeeded justices who voted to affirm abortion rights—now sit on the court."
