    "body": "When it comes to standing up to Beijing, the women are playing a tougher game than the men. Two years ago the National Basketball Association apologized when one of its general managers angered China with a tweet about Hong Kong. In sharp contrast, the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) is today standing firm on its demand that an allegation by a star player that she was sexually assaulted by a high-ranking Chinese official “must be investigated fully, fairly, transparently and without censorship.”<br />The WTA call came after Peng Shuai, a championship tennis player, used her account on Weibo to accuse Zhang Gaoli, a former vice premier of China, of forcing her to have sex. She also said the two had a years-long on-off consensual relationship. Within a half hour, her post was taken down."
