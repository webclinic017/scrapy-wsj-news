    "body": "If history is any guide, Democrats will lose control of the House next year. Of the 10 previous postwar presidents who entered the Oval Office via election, nine saw their party suffer losses in the House, averaging 23 seats, during their first midterm. The exception was George W. Bush, who rode his soaring post-9/11 job approval to gain a modest eight Republican seats in 2002.<br />Although Democratic leaders hope to defy this dismal history, their official game plan doesn’t look promising. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, believes that the solution is better messaging—“telling people what you’ve done,” starting with the president."
