    "body": "Consumer-price inflation in the eurozone likely hit a record high in November, but many economists think that might mark a peak for now, and therefore donâ€™t expect the European Central Bank to raise its key interest rate next year.<br />As in the U.S., consumer prices in the eurozone have risen faster over recent months than most economists and policy makers had expected. The data have raised questions for investors, businesses and households about the credibility of central bank assertions that this period of high inflation is likely to prove transitory."
