    "body": "Crypto entrepreneurs are overdue for a lesson on what happens when they pilfer others’ most precious intellectual property.<br />A Florida-based developer, Matthew Jensen, received a sharp legal rebuke this week in his defense of the “one token that rules them all.” He insisted that his JRR Token stood for “Journey through Risk to Reward” and that the name’s resemblance to that of the late fantasy author, as well as the wizard and ring imagery on his now defunct site, were coincidental. The World Intellectual Property Organization was having none of it. Mr. Jensen also must pay the J.R.R. Tolkien estate’s legal costs."
