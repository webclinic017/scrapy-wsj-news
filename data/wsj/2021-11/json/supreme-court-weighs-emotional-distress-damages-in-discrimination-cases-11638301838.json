    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Tuesday wrestled with whether people with disabilities can seek monetary damages for emotional distress when they allegedly face discrimination in obtaining medical treatment.<br />At issue was the case of a deaf and visually impaired woman in Texas who needed physical therapy for back pain. When she contacted a Dallas-Fort Worth area clinic in 2016 and 2017, she requested a sign-language interpreter, saying she couldn’t effectively communicate without one. The clinic declined, instead offering that they could communicate with notes, gestures and lip reading."
