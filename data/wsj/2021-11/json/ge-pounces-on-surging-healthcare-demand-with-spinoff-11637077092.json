    "body": "In spinning off its healthcare business,  General Electric Co.  is betting on the fast-growing diagnostic-imaging-equipment market, a sector facing disruption from artificial intelligence and growing competition from startups as well as established players.<br />GE Healthcare—which makes MRI, ultrasound and other healthcare equipment—will be spun off in early 2023, with GE planning to retain a 19.9% stake in the new firm. Already dominant in the sector, as a stand-alone it would be able to move faster and have more capital to scoop up companies and technologies, analysts said."
