    "body": "A federal appeals court in California on Tuesday upheld the state’s ban on large-capacity firearm magazines, reversing earlier rulings that had found the restriction unconstitutional and giving gun-control advocates a victory at a moment of uncertainty around the scope of Second Amendment rights.<br />In a 7-4 ruling, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that the state’s prohibition on magazines that can carry more than 10 rounds of ammunition was a reasonable and minor restriction on gun rights that aimed to limit the carnage of mass shootings."
