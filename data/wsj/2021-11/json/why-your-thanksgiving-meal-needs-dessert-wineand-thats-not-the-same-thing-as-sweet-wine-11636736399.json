    "body": "SO MUCH IS MADE of the Thanksgiving meal—the turkey, the stuffing, the traditional sides—all accompanied by just the right wine. But what of the pie that’s served at the end? Dessert-wine pairing has become something of a lost art.<br />Dessert wine and sweet wine are actually distinct categories. Dessert wines are styled to pair with food, whereas sweet wines are simply jacked up with sugar to please sweet-mad palates. A great dessert wine—still, sparkling or fortified—doesn’t only deliver sweetness but also heightens the flavor of food, whether apple tart or pumpkin pie."
