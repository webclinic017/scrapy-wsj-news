    "body": "India didn’t roll over last year when China sent troops into disputed Himalayan territory. But it hasn’t been able to repel Beijing’s advances either, and things could get worse if New Delhi doesn’t learn from its mistakes.<br />Since May 2020, Indian and Chinese troops have faced off in at least four places along their 2,200-mile boundary. In June 2020 the standoff was marked by the first loss of life on the boundary in 45 years, when 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese died in hand-to-hand combat. The extent of Chinese incursions into territory India also claims remains unclear—in part because the two countries have conflicting and overlapping claims, and in part because the Indian government has not offered official clarification."
