    "body": "WASHINGTON—Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) issued criticism of Democrats’ $1.85 trillion social and climate spending effort, withholding his support for a legislative framework that the White House had cast as a consensus acceptable to all 50 members of the Senate Democratic caucus.<br />“I’m open to supporting a final bill that helps move our country forward. But I’m equally open to voting against a bill that hurts our country,” he said at an afternoon press conference."
