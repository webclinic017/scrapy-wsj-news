    "body": "Thank you for publishing Dorian Abbot’s “The Views That Made Me Persona Non Grata at MIT” (op-ed, Oct. 30). It reflects the opinion of so many who have felt their voices suppressed for so long—whether at meetings for the local planning commission, school board, church or soccer-club selection. Mr. Abbot instills a level of confidence sorely missing in our public discourse.<br />Pete Moegenburg"
