    "body": "‘The Mighty Underdogs” might make one think, however fleetingly, of a junior edition “Best in Show,” Christopher Guest’s wonderfully snarky 2000 comedy about dog shows, dogs and dog-show people. But the Discovery series is more akin to “Spellbound,” the 2002 film about the national spelling bee that spawned an entire school of documentaries, ones in which a director will focus on a specialized pursuit, the charming children and less-charming parents involved, and rolls the dice about which subjects will win both hearts and the game.<br />Like “Spellbound” and its kin—which includes every kid version of a competitive reality show—“The Mighty Underdogs” is much more about the people than the contest, or even the dogs, which are upstanding, hardworking and would seem to have fewer issues than the young people learning to handle them. It’s a fiercely competitive arena—thousands of kids try to win the requisite number of qualifying competitions to reach the Westminster Dog Show, but only a fraction do. Their motivations for competing may vary (“My therapist suggested it,” says one) but they’re generally likeable, with stories to tell and much to learn. Which they do. So do we."
