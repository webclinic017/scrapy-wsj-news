    "body": "A week is a long time in international politics. Last Monday U.S.-China relations were in free-fall. This coming Monday, President Biden and General Secretary Xi Jinping will have had their first full (albeit virtual) summit, following the surprise statement by their envoys in Glasgow on their resolve to work together on climate.<br />In the intervening week, Mr. Xi has concluded a major plenum of the Chinese Communist Party, which further entrenched his power. This is likely to make him an even more formidable adversary for the U.S."
