    "body": "Habi Zhang asks how America will compete with a China that is determined to train the best mathematicians, scientists and engineers (“The Coddling of American Children Is a Boon to Beijing,” op-ed, Nov. 22). The answer is freedom and the profit motive. I will pit the “mediocre” American student, who has freedom and the opportunity to get ahead and enjoy the fruits of his success, against the Chinese student who is pushed to serve the Communist Party and state, and let’s see who will work harder and be more innovative.<br />There is a reason companies such as  Microsoft ,  Google and  Amazon  are made in the U.S. Freedom breeds innovation. Chinese crackdowns breed fear, including the fear of nationalization. How hard do people work to innovate when they are afraid that their success can lead to the government taking away everything they have worked to build?"
