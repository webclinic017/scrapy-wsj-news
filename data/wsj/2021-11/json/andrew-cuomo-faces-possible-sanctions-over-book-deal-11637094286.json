    "body": "ALBANY, N.Y.—New York’s ethics watchdog revoked its approval of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s pandemic memoir on Tuesday, a move that paves the way for sanctions over the $5.1 million publishing contract he signed last year.<br />Mr. Cuomo published “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons From the Covid-19 Pandemic” in October 2020 after his management of the early days of the outbreak in New York made him a national figure."
