    "body": "Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt is set to decide the fate of Julius Jones, who was convicted in a fatal 1999 shooting and is scheduled to be executed Thursday. The stateâ€™s parole board has raised doubts about his guilt. The case has drawn national attention with celebrities such as Kim Kardashian West calling his incarceration a miscarriage of justice and more than 6.4 million people signing an online petition asking Mr. Stitt, a Republican, to stop the execution.<br />Mr. Jones was a 19-year-old student at the University of Oklahoma when he was arrested and prosecuted in the death of Paul Howell, who was fatally shot during a carjacking. Mr. Jones, now 41, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. His co-defendant, Christopher Jordan, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Mr. Jordan testified against Mr. Jones at the trial."
