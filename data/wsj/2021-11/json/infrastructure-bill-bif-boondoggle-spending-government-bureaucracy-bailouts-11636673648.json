    "body": "Regarding Ranjay Gulati’s op-ed “Don’t Let the Infrastructure Bill Become a Boondoggle,” (Nov. 9): As a management consultant out in the real world, I understand the fallacy of solving problems in the abstract with such magical words as “must,” “need to,” “ensuring” and so forth. Consider sentences such as: “The unwieldy government bureaucracy . . . must work hard to complete these projects efficiently and effectively” and “the Biden administration needs to coordinate efforts among federal, state and local agencies to deliver on the promise of this bill.”<br />Those words fall apart when they meet reality—especially government workers over whom you have very little power and who may have far different objectives. The obvious strategy of the infrastructure bill is to be a boondoggle. That’s not a bug, it’s a feature."
