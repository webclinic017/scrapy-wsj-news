    "body": "The five commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission exercise broad regulatory and administrative authority over America’s airwaves. They are powerful regulators of speech. President Biden’s decision to nominate partisan Gigi Sohn to the FCC provides fresh evidence of the Democratic Party’s leftward lurch.<br />Among Mr. Biden’s inner circle, Ms. Sohn’s political tweets no doubt earn nods of approval. “I have Republican Friends—They’re Not All Insane;” “if g-d forbid Trump wins, the only thing protecting our Republic is the Ds taking over the Senate;” “I don’t give a rat if you want to still be a Republican. But if you think @realDonaldTrump is destroying the Constitution and this country, you must vote for @JoeBiden, full stop.” But there is a difference between dime-a-dozen West Wing political appointees and the long-lasting power and influence of an FCC commissioner. Ms. Sohn’s rabid partisanship disqualifies her as a candidate for the FCC."
