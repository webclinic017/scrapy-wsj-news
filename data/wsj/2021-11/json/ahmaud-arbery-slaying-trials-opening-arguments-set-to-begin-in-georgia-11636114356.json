    "body": "BRUNSWICK, Ga.—Opening arguments are expected to begin Friday in the trial of three white men charged in the February 2020 killing of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man.<br />The trial was delayed after the early handling of the case by the area’s then-district attorney, court closures related to the Covid-19 pandemic and weeks of jury selection. Prosecutors said in court filings that Gregory McMichael, his son Travis McMichael and William “Roddie” Bryan Jr. assaulted Mr. Arbery several times and shot and killed him while he was out for a run during daylight hours in Satilla Shores, a mostly white residential area outside Brunswick."
