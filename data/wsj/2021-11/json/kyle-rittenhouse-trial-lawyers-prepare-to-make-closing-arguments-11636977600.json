    "body": "Lawyers in the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager charged in the killing of two people during unrest in Kenosha, Wis., last year, are set to make closing arguments Monday, with the high-profile case expected to head to the jury later in the day.<br />Mr. Rittenhouse, now 18 years old, faces charges of intentional, reckless and attempted homicide, and reckless endangerment and possession of a firearm as a minor. The case concerns his actions the night of Aug. 25, 2020, as he patrolled the city with a small medical kit and an AR-15-style rifle amid unrest after the police shooting of Jacob Blake. He has pleaded not guilty, and his attorneys have argued he acted in self-defense. Mr. Rittenhouse, who lived in Antioch, Ill., at the time, has been free on $2 million in bail, mostly raised by supporters online."
