    "body": "On April 18, 1969, the dynastic Boston Celtics, featuring Bill Russell in the twilight of his career and John Havlicek in the prime of his, led the New York Knickerbockers in the NBA Eastern Conference Finals, three games to two. I was 15 years old and the Knicks were my passion. Game Six was held at Boston Garden, famous for its parquet floor and for a bald man named Red Auerbach perched in a courtside seat, victory cigar at the ready. I watched the game on the portable black-and-white TV in my bedroom.<br />It was a back-and-forth contest from the beginning. But in the closing minutes, the Celtics surged ahead; the dagger was a high-degree-of-difficulty bank shot by Havlicek with nine seconds left. The buzzer sounded with the Celtics up by a point, leaving me in a state of rage and despair I had never before experienced."
