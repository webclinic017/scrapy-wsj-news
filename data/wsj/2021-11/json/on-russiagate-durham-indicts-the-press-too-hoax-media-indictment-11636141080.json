    "body": "It is the nature of any inquiry that more information is gained with the passage of time. Today’s information is more complete than yesterday’s. It affords better insight, deeper perspective and sounder judgment.<br />And this is exactly what’s wrong and upside-down with ABC News’s recent “special report” on Christopher Steele and his dossier. By any measure—man-hours invested, expertise, intellectual rigor, standards of accountability, resources deployed—the credible efforts, by a proverbial country mile, were not those of Mr. Steele and his “primary sub source,” but their debunkers, including the Mueller task force, the FBI, the Justice Department’s inspector general and its special counsel John Durham."
