    "body": "A federal judge in Washington sentenced the wife of Mexico’s drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Tuesday to three years in prison for her role in helping her husband pull off a spectacular escape from a maximum security Mexican prison as well as help him run the billion-dollar Sinaloa drug cartel during the time he was behind bars.<br />Judge Rudolph Contreras gave Emma Coronel a lower sentence than the four years requested by federal prosecutors. Ms. Coronel has already forfeited nearly $1.5 million as part of her guilty plea. In June, Ms. Coronel, the U.S.-born mother of nine-year-old twin girls, pleaded guilty to three counts of money laundering and drug trafficking after having been detained at Dulles International Airport near Washington."
