    "body": "PADMA LAKSHMI first boarded a plane at age 4 to make a solo trans-Atlantic journey from New Delhi to New York to reunite with her mother. Travel continued to shape her life and career as an international model who hosted a variety show while living in Italy—long before she landed the gig as an itinerant co-host of Bravo’s “Top Chef.”<br />After the coronavirus pandemic grounded her for six months last year, Ms. Lakshmi’s wanderlust resurged stronger than ever. “Travel is as basic to my existence as being a woman is. I feel very passionately that the more we travel, the more we understand each other,” Ms. Lakshmi said in a phone interview from Houston, where she was filming “Top Chef” Season 19, which will air next year."
