    "body": "When the Supreme Court on Wednesday hears oral arguments about a Mississippi law that bans abortions after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy, the issue in contention will be clear. Ever since the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 the court has held that women have a constitutional right to an abortion up to the point of viability—roughly 24 weeks. Expect to read a great deal about how pro-lifers seek to impose their moral views on the nation.<br />Nothing could be further from the truth. Certainly the pro-life community would cheer a ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization upholding the Mississippi law. Pro-lifers would also welcome the encouragement that would give other states to pass similar laws."
