    "body": "WASHINGTON—Several Trump administration officials showed a “willful disregard” of laws restricting government employees’ political activity in the final weeks of the 2020 presidential campaign, according to a federal watchdog report released Tuesday.<br />The report concludes that a speech by then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Jerusalem as well as a naturalization ceremony put on by the Department of Homeland Security that were both later incorporated into the Republican National Convention ceremonies were violations of a law called the Hatch Act."
