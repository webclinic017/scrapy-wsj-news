    "body": "Even in this polarized era, tax reform can be bipartisan. See Louisiana, where voters on Saturday approved a constitutional amendment that will reduce corporate and individual income tax rates while simplifying the code.<br />Louisiana is one of only three states—the others are Alabama and Iowa—that allows taxpayers to deduct 100% of their federal income tax liability against state taxes. Iowa is set to repeal its federal tax deductibility in 2023, and little wonder. Tying the state tax code to the federal code can create enormous distortions in business investment and state revenue."
