    "body": "Launching a Federal Trade Commission investigation of oil companies for collusion has long been the go-to response by politicians eager to shift the blame for higher gasoline prices away from their own misguided energy policies (“Biden’s Gas Price Diversion,” Review & Outlook, Nov. 18).<br />Most branded retail gas stations aren’t owned by Big Oil; they are owned and operated by independent franchisees, who set prices themselves. Those prices are set partly in response to wholesale prices, which again are not set by Big Oil, but by supply-and-demand conditions faced by independent wholesale “jobbers.”"
