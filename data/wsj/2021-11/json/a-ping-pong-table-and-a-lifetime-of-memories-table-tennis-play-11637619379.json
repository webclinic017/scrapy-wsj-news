    "body": "You wouldn’t think an old slab of wood could provide such joy. You wouldn’t think it could fill a life with so many memories.<br />Certainly Steve Fortuna had no such hopes 50 years ago when he paid $15 for it. He works in finance now, in downtown Chicago, and was sharing some stories with me about his old neighborhood. Back then he lived with his mother, his father and three sisters in a four-room apartment. His bed was a couch in the living room. One bathroom for the six of them, with a bathtub, no shower."
