    "body": "Bob Greene’s op-ed “Dime Scorecards Were Worth Something” (Oct. 27) brought back fond memories. My friends and I used to lean our unlocked bikes against the first base wall of Wrigley Field, get a hot dog with all the trimmings, sneak under the turnstiles and sit behind first base. In those days, there were very few Cubs fans. We meticulously kept score in case the umpire lost track and needed to check the count or the score.<br />The reason we sat behind first base with our gloves was to take advantage of the Cubs great double-play combination of Ernie Banks to Gene Baker to the grandstand, if the throw was wild. We hoped to catch it, ride to Lincoln park, play baseball and, then, trade our collection of cards that came wrapped with our bubble gum. Today, those cards would have been wonderful birthday gifts for our grandsons, if only our mothers hadn’t thrown them out when we all went to college."
