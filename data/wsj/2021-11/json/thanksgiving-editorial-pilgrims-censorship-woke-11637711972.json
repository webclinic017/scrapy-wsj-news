    "body": "Regarding “Censoring the Pilgrims” (Review & Outlook, Nov. 23): First, they have gone after your Thanksgiving editorials. Next, they will come after your Christmas Eve editorial. Then, your Houses of Worship column on Fridays, and finally, Pepper . . . and Salt (clearly not woke).<br />It is wise to draw a line in the sand because the Change.orgs of the world are relentless and will never be satisfied with a surrender to their cause of the day. The Journal flourishes because its editorial content is appreciated by serious readers who find few alternatives in the media landscape."
