    "body": "In “Should Aspiring Entrepreneurs Major in Business?” (Journal Report, Nov. 4), John Sullivan suggests that business founders need specific skills. As a business owner, I agree. But I disagree that a college business program necessarily provides those skills.<br />Henry Doss, who takes the other side in the debate, is closer to reality. The skills business owners need lie in critical thinking, communication and “insight into the human condition.” I was a communication major. I learned more about business in my public-relations class than in business electives. We learned to create audience profiles, similar to customer or client profiles. We learned to ask “what’s the situation?” about a given issue. In business, we need to find the problems our customers have and provide solutions. The parallels run deeper than I have space to write."
