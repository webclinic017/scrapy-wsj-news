    "body": "WASHINGTON—Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon surrendered to law enforcement Monday and was released on his own recognizance, days after a federal grand jury indicted him on criminal contempt of Congress charges for defying a subpoena from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.<br />Mr. Bannon, 67 years old, turned himself in at the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Washington office just before 10 a.m. Monday. During a short afternoon hearing, he said little other than acknowledging he understood the conditions of his release, which include weekly check-ins with court officials and the surrender of his passport. Mr. Bannon will likely enter a plea during another hearing set for Thursday."
