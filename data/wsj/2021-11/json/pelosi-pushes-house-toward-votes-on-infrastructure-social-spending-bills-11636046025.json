    "body": "WASHINGTON—A push from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to bring up Democrats’ healthcare, education and climate package for a vote as early as Thursday hit a series of snags as lawmakers continued to haggle over immigration and the deduction on state and local taxes.<br />The California Democrat told House Democrats in a closed-door meeting on Thursday that she hoped the House would vote on the bill later that day, and then vote on the Senate-passed infrastructure bill on Friday, according to people familiar with her remarks. Progressives have been blocking the roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill until they were satisfied with the language in the social-spending and climate-change bill."
