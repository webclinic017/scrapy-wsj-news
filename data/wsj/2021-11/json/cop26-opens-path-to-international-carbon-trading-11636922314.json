    "body": "International carbon markets got a shot in the arm in Glasgow on Saturday after governments agreed on long-stalled rules for how countries, and companies, can trade carbon-emissions credits across borders.<br />Negotiations over the carbon agreement were overshadowed at the United Nations climate summit by a higher-profile deal on emissions cuts and climate-change funding. That broader deal asks itsÂ 190-plus signatories next year to revisit emissions-cutting plans that fell short of what scientists say is enough to prevent the worst possible effects of climate change. The deal, though, left big questions about how governments will follow through."
