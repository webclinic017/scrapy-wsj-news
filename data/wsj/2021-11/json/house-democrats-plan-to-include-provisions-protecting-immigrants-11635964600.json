    "body": "WASHINGTON—House Democrats included new protections for immigrants in the country illegally in the revised text of their social spending and climate bill released Wednesday, after several previous proposals hit a dead end in the Senate.<br />The protections would shield the immigrants from deportation for five years and provide a five-year, renewable work authorization. But a group of Hispanic lawmakers said that the provisions included in the bill wouldn’t open up a pathway to citizenship and need to go further."
