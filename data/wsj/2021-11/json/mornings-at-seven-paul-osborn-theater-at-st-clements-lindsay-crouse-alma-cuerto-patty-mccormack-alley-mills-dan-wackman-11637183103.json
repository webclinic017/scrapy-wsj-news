    "body": "New York<br />Paul Osborn’s “Morning’s at Seven” is a great American play that is not widely recognized as such. The original 1939 Broadway production was a flop, running for only 44 performances, and even though “Morning’s at Seven” has since received two successful Broadway revivals, in 1980 and 2002, it has still never quite managed to establish itself as the modern classic that it is. I have heard of only one professional revival in the past 15 years, by Philadelphia’s People’s Light in 2018, and that one, while it was outstanding, did not lead to a wider renewal of interest in the play."
