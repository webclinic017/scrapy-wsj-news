    "body": "Regarding “Ganging Up on Moderna” (op-ed, Nov. 17): The National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies are critical partners and funders of basic research that benefits domestic manufacturing, especially in the biomedical sciences. Public-private partnerships have supported many life-changing advancements, but private-sector research dwarfs the federal contribution.<br />A National Association of Manufacturers study finds that biopharmaceutical manufacturers annually invest $83 billion in R&D, all aimed at drug development. By contrast, less than 9% of the NIH’s fiscal 2019 budget of $39 billion—or $3.5 billion—was focused on research directly related to drug development. It is disingenuous for some policy makers to suggest otherwise as they try to justify stripping manufacturers of intellectual property protections."
