    "body": "There’s a famous story from the set of “At Close Range,” the 1986 film starring Christopher Walken and Sean Penn as father-and-son criminals. In one scene, Mr. Penn points a gun directly at Mr. Walken’s face. According to the story, Mr. Walken was diligent about checking the pistol before every take to make sure it wasn’t loaded. Moments before the cameras rolled, Mr. Penn grew frantic.<br />“Give me the other gun,” he shouted at a crew member, who duly complied. At that moment, the director called “Action!” The terror on Mr. Walken’s face is real, and it’s in the movie."
