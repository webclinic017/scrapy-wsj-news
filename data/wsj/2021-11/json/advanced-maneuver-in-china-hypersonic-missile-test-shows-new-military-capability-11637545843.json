    "body": "A hypersonic missile test China carried out last summer involved a sophisticated maneuver in which a projectile was fired from the system during the flight, according to U.S. officials, in a sign that the Chinese program is more advanced than previously known.<br />The hypersonic test, which was earlier reported this fall, and the advanced capabilities of the Chinese missile, show the pace at which the Chinese are developing advanced weaponry that is outpacing American technology. U.S. officials have expressed concern that Beijing is moving faster than expected to build platforms that could target American ports or installations in the Indo-Pacific region."
