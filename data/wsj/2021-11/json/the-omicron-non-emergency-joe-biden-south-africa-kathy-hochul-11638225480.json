    "body": "Markets rebounded Monday following their Friday freak-out over the Omicron variant of Covid-19. President Biden also seems to be calming down, though other politicians continue to impose restrictions and mandates that will do more harm than good.<br />Speaking at the White House on Monday, Mr. Biden said Omicron is a cause for concern but not panic. He stressed the need for vaccinations and booster shots, but he said new lockdowns aren’t being considered. That’s a relief after his rush to block air travel from several countries in southern Africa on Friday."
