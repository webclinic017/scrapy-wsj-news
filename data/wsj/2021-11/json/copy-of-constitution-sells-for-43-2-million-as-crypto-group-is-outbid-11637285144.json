    "body": "The art market wasn’t ready for revolution. A rare, first-edition copy of the U.S. Constitution sold for $43.2 million at Sotheby’s Thursday, but it appears the winner is a private collector rather than an online group of cryptocurrency investors.<br />The group, called ConstitutionDAO, caused a stir in art and crypto circles this week by pooling more than $40 million to bid, but an anonymous phone bidder pledged even more and will take home one of the 13 surviving official copies of the Constitution."
