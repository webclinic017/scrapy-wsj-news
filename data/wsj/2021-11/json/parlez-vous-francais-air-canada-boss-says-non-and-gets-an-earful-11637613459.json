    "body": "On a cool, wet Saturday afternoon in the outskirts of Montreal, near the city’s main airport, a crowd of about 100 gathered in front of  Air Canada ’s  headquarters demanding the resignation of the airline’s chief executive.<br />It had nothing to do with a lackluster stock performance at Canada’s largest airline. Protesters were mad that the CEO, who has lived in Montreal for roughly 14 years, can’t speak French."
