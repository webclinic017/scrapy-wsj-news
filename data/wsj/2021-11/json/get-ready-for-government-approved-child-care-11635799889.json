    "body": "President Joe Bidenappeared to fall asleep on Monday at an international gathering to discuss the climate issue he describes as an existential threat to the world. But back in the U.S. the remaining so-called moderate Democrats in Congress are the ones who seem to be asleep as they prepare to vote for an existential threat to private preschools and day care.<br />Given the multitrillion-dollar bundle of government interventions Mr. Biden is attempting to enact, itâ€™s not surprising that even highly consequential items are getting lost in the legislative shuttle without serious debate."
