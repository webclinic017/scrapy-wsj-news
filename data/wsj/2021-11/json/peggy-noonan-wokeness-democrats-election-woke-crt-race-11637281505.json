    "body": "What exactly is it about wokeness that has evoked such a reaction? Its premise, that there is much racism in U.S. history and in American biases, conscious and unconscious, is not controversial. Who could deny that slavery, Jim Crow and de jure and de facto segregation were not racist, or would argue that their effects could have disappeared entirely?<br />In “Democrats Need to Face Down the Woke” (Declarations, Nov. 13), Peggy Noonan identifies the aspect of wokeness that many find so offensive: the second premise, that “we are not individual persons with souls; we are part of identity groups marked by specific traits.” It is a kind of Calvinism in reverse: If we are not the victims of racism, we are morally fallen, and can do nothing to redeem ourselves. This premise stings, because most of us think of ourselves as good people with free will, or at least aspire to such. When this premise is weaponized politically, it seems manipulative as well as offensive."
