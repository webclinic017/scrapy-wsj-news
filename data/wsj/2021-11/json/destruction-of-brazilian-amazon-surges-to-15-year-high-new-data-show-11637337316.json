    "body": "SÃO PAULO—Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest has reached a 15-year high, newly released data shows. The surge is prompting environmentalists and scientists to question the government’s willingness to meet the pledge it made at the COP26 climate summit earlier this month to end illegal woodlands destruction by 2028.<br />About 5,100 square miles of Brazil’s Amazon—bigger than the size of Connecticut—was denuded in the 12 months between August 2020 and the end of July, a rise of 22% from the previous year and the most deforestation in one year since 2006, according to Brazil’s space research agency, INPE."
