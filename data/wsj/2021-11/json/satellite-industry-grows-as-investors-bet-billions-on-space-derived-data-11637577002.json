    "body": "Dozens of companies are dotting the skies with satellites, part of a growing bet that buyers on Earth will pay billions of dollars for a more granular view of the planet. Not all of the companies are likely to make it, according to industry observers.<br />Investors are pouring money into remote-sensing companies, with  BlackSky Technology Inc.  and  Spire Global Inc.  merging with so-called special-purpose acquisition companies this year. Competitors including Planet Labs Inc., Satellogic and Terran Orbital Corp. also have struck deals to go public by combining with SPACs, while other companies have raised money from venture-capital funds."
