    "body": "In 1909, a shadowy syndicate of treasure hunters set out from England on an expedition to Jerusalem. Their goal was nothing less than to find and take possession of the Ark of the Covenant—the legendary gold-covered chest in which the shattered remains of the Ten Commandments were said to be stored. Some of the group were fascinated by the mysterious quest itself; some hoped to become rich beyond their wildest dreams.<br />At the head of the expedition was Monty Parker, the son of an English earl and a veteran of the First Boer War. But the group’s ace-in-the-hole was Valter Juvelius, an eccentric Finnish scholar who claimed to have uncovered a code—in the Old Testament’s Book of Ezekiel, based on the number seven—that would lead them to the Ark. This may sound far-fetched today, but the period between the mid-19th and early-20th centuries was a time of fevered archaeological exploration marked by improbable discoveries across the remnants of the ancient world. Finds of the time included the Cuerdale Hoard in England, the palace of Knossos in Crete and Paleolithic cave art in Altamira, Spain."
