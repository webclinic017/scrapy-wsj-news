    "body": "SINGAPORE—One afternoon in late August, while manning a military checkpoint in a central Myanmar city, Sgt. Htet Aung noticed an unusual post near the top of his Facebook feed: an audio interview with an army defector urging others to desert. He clicked.<br />The clip was part of an activist campaign to lure soldiers away from Myanmar’s armed forces. Defector support groups have had some success winning over disillusioned youths such as Mr. Htet Aung, 23, who says he fled his base three weeks later and joined a rebellion against the country’s military junta."
