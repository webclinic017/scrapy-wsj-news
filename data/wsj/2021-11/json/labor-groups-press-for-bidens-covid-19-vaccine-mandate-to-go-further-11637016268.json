    "body": "Three labor organizations are calling on the Biden administration to review its Covid-19 vaccine mandate, with some indicating the policy is too limited in applying to only large businesses.<br />The AFL-CIO and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union filed a petition in federal court last week asking the Occupational Health and Safety Administration to review the new federal vaccine policy, which directs companies with 100 or more employees to require that workers either be vaccinated or get tested regularly for Covid-19 and wear masks. SEIU, Local 32BJ, which is a part of the larger Service Employees International Union, also filed a petition in federal court last week."
