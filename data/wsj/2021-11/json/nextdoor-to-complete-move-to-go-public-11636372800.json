    "body": "Nextdoor Inc., the free social-networking app aimed at connecting local neighborhoods, is due to make its stock-market debut Monday, capitalizing on its widening appeal during the pandemic.<br />The San Francisco-based company that was founded a decade ago made its name helping people scout locally for dog walkers or gripe about neighbors. During the height of the pandemic, with people stuck at home, users took to the platform to check on and stay connected with their neighbors. User numbers shot up to 58 million last year from 48 million in 2019. They grew to 63 million by mid-2021."
