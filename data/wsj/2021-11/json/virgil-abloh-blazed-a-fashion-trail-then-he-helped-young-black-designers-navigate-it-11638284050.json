    "body": "The death of trailblazing designer Virgil Abloh last weekend leaves a gaping hole for a younger generation of Black designers who drew inspiration from him, as the industry continues to face criticism about too few Black creatives and executives in top key roles at major fashion houses.<br />As tributes to the designer, who died Sunday of a rare and aggressive cancer, kept flowing this week from his peers, celebrities and fans, many young and aspiring Black designers recalled how much Mr. Abloh motivated them and how eager he was to help other Black people make it in a notoriously tough business."
