    "body": "CARACAS, Venezuela—The ruling Socialist government in Venezuela early Monday claimed sweeping victory in local and state elections that for the first time in four years included the participation of most of the country’s beleaguered, U.S.-backed opposition movement.<br />With more than 90% of votes counted, President Nicolás Maduro’s party won all but three of the 23 state governor offices and most of the 3,000 races for mayor and municipal council positions that were up for grabs in Sunday’s elections, said the National Electoral Council after midnight on Monday. About 41% of eligible voters cast a ballot, the lowest participation rate in regional elections in at least two decades."
