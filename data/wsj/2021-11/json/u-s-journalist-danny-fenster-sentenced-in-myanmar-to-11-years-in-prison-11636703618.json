    "body": "An American journalist detained in Myanmar was sentenced to 11 years in prison, his employer said, deepening tensions between Washington and the country’s military that seized power in February.<br />U.S. officials have repeatedly called for the release of Danny Fenster, who has been detained at Yangon’s Insein Prison with little access to his lawyer or relatives. He was arrested at Yangon International Airport on May 24 as he was heading to the U.S. to visit his family, and was later charged with five criminal offenses."
