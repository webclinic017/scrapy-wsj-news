    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration’s deal to ease off steel and aluminum tariffs from Europe has won plaudits from much of U.S. industry, but a complex new quota system that comes with it has fueled concerns for small importers.<br />The deal, announced during the Group of 20 summit last weekend, allows the European Union to export steel and aluminum duty free until reaching a quota of 3.3 million metric tons of steel and 384,000 metric tons of aluminum a year."
