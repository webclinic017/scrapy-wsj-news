    "body": "Managing French sensibilities is never easy. But President Biden set back U.S. interests in the Pacific Friday by bungling his intervention in the bitter standoff between the French and Australian heads of state.<br />French President Emanuel Macron is furious that Australia called off its military submarine contract with France in favor of a U.S. deal. Washington announced in September that it will share sensitive nuclear-submarine technology with Australia as part of Aukus, a strategic partnership among the U.S., U.K. and Australia to balance China. The resulting French diplomatic onslaught put Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on the defensive."
