    "body": "Ronald Reagan wouldn’t have been surprised at last week’s Republican turnabout. He predicted several previous such conservative comebacks, starting with the one he led in 1980.<br />Peter Hannaford (1932-2015), who worked for Reagan for 30 years as a communications and media adviser, was a friend of mine. He would often tell me after a disastrous election for conservatives that Reagan had the wisdom to put it into perspective and the ability to inspire optimism about the future."
