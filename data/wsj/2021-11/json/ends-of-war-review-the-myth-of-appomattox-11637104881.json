    "body": "When Robert E. Lee surrendered his battered Confederate army to Ulysses S. Grant at Virginia’s Appomattox Court House on Palm Sunday, April 9, 1865, the flames fanning the Civil War were extinguished—so the story goes—as abruptly as if turned off by a switch. Offered generous terms to abandon their rebellion, Lee’s soldiers supposedly stacked rifles meekly and returned to civilian life, never again to take up arms against their country.<br />But as America’s sloppy withdrawal from Afghanistan recently reminded us, the final days and weeks of war, and the large-scale evacuations that invariably follow, are seldom, if ever, orderly. There were always problems with the rosy myths about Appomattox and its aftermath, not least among them the fact that ex-Confederates soon undertook a second civil war, against Reconstruction in general and African-Americans in particular."
