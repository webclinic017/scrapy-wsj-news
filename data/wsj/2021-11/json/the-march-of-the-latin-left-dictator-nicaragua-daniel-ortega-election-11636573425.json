    "body": "Nicaraguan dictator Daniel Ortega claims to have won re-election on Sunday with 76% of the vote. That makes him a slacker compared to Fidel Castro, who during a half-century of one-man rule in Cuba typically carried 99%. But it’s one more sign of Latin America’s descent into left-wing dictatorship.<br />The result underscores how Mr. Ortega has strangled Nicaragua’s democratic institutions, with nary a peep from democracy advocates abroad. The former Sandinista guerilla has been at the Nicaraguan helm since 2006, and with this sham poll he rubber-stamps a fourth five-year term."
