    "body": "The trial of three Georgia men charged in the killing of Ahmaud Arbery began Nov. 5 in Brunswick, Ga.<br />Prosecutors have argued Gregory McMichael, his son, Travis McMichael, and neighbor William “Roddie” Bryan Jr. chased Mr. Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, and killed him based on unfounded suspicions. Defense attorneys argued he was killed by men trained in law enforcement who were protecting their neighborhood after a rash of burglaries and thefts. All three defendants are white."
