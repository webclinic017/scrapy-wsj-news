    "body": "LaNiah Moon had just moved out of her college dorm and into her parents’ house in February when she received a direct message on Instagram from a woman named Maya, offering her an opportunity to “make some quick cash.”<br />Ms. Moon, 22 years old, had lost her on-campus job the year before when the Covid-19 pandemic began, and was taking classes remotely from home in Chicago while also looking for a job. She says Maya told her that if she gave her $150, she could “flip” it into $1,500."
