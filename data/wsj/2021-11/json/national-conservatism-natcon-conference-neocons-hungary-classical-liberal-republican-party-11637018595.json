    "body": "Christopher DeMuth’s “Why America Needs National Conservatism” (op-ed, Nov. 13) was so fascinating I read it twice—and the second time I conducted an experiment. I removed the adjective “national” whenever it modified “conservatism” and found that it didn’t make much of a difference to his case.<br />Mr. DeMuth lists the accomplishments of the conservative movement in economics, social policy and jurisprudence, and explains that the current moment demands institutional reform in the spirit of both Edmund Burke and Adam Smith. As he points out, an earlier generation of conservatives made exactly this point. They did so without abandoning the classical liberal principles of limited government, equality under the law, religious pluralism and individual rights."
