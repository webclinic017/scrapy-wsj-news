    "body": "WASHINGTON—Alarm bells are ringing in the Democratic Party as it prepares to defend its narrow House majority in the 2022 midterm elections.<br />When a progressive firm last month polled Black voters, a key Democratic constituency, it found less than half saying their lives had improved under President Biden.
