    "body": "The wisest film in rock ’n’ roll history has been available only on VHS since it premiered in 1970. “Let It Be” documents the Beatles’ January 1969 recording sessions and the band’s dissolution.<br />Even hard-core Beatles fans may not have seen the movie, and I fret that even with talk of a remastered release, it will likely take a back seat to Peter Jackson’s new “Get Back” documentary series, which is sourced from the same material, but with a happier spin."
