    "body": "Voters have won at least one small political victory in the wake of last week’s thumping of Democrats. To wit, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has vowed not to raise taxes.<br />Ms. Hochul swore off near-term tax hikes Thursday in an interview with local magazine City & State. “I’m not interested in driving people out of the state,” she said, noting the loss of New Yorkers to Florida and other low-tax clim said she wants to attract business to refill empty offices, and “raising taxes right now will not accomplish that.”"
