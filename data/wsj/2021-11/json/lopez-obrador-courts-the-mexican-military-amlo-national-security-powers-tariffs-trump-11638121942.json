    "body": "When Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador pronounced himself above the constitution last week, it felt for some like the beginning of the end of the Mexican democracy.<br />His bold decree, published in the federal register on Nov. 22, is likely to be struck down by Mexico’s Supreme Court. This suggests that it is an act of desperation rather than a sign of strength. But there may be another reason for making an outlandish claim that even the president expects won’t stand."
