    "body": "As we pay tribute every November to those who serve and have served, I always think of Dennis Miller of La Salle, Michigan. Dennis gave the ultimate sacrifice during a firefight in Ramadi, Iraq, on November 10, 2004. His parents were notified of his death the next dayâ€”on Veterans Day. I was his company commander, bearing ultimate responsibility for his death.<br />I was wounded but survived with minimal harm. I was less lucky two months later, when a roadside IED detonated and ripped through my lower body. I was evacuated by a Marine Corps helicopter and operated on at a Navy surgical facility. Some 25 sailors and Marines gave their blood to save my life."
