    "body": "Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had to eat crow in 2009 when tiny Honduras refused to obey her decree to reinstate a former sitting president who had been legally deposed by the military. Honduras is still paying the price for Mrs. Clinton’s imperialism.<br />President Manuel Zelaya, who was an ally of Hugo Chávez, had been using mob violence to try to stay in power. The military argued that it upheld its oath to defend the constitution when it removed him. Honduran institutions, including Mr. Zelaya’s own Liberal Party, the Catholic Church and the Supreme Court, backed the military."
