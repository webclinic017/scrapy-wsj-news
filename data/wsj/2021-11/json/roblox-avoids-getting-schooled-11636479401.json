    "body": "A Halloween mishap didn’t scare away  Roblox ’s  users—possibly because more of them are old enough not to scare so easily.<br />The videogame platform that already runs its own metaverse posted strong third-quarter results late Monday. Bookings for the quarter jumped 28% year over year to about $638 million, beating Wall Street’s projections. And while Roblox doesn’t give a formal forecast, Chief Executive David Baszucki noted in the company’s conference call Tuesday morning that a major outage of its platform over the Halloween weekend resulted in “essentially no loss of users and continuation of our user trends.”"
