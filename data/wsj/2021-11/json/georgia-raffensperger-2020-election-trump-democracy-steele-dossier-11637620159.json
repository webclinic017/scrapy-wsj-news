    "body": "I respect Brad Raffensperger for resisting former President Trump’s attempt to get him to rig the Georgia election results. But Mr. Raffensperger’s attempt to blame the current Republican lack of confidence in elections on the Steele dossier is political hogwash (“Who Stole Americans’ Confidence in Elections?” op-ed, Nov. 16). So is his attempt to blame Stacey Abrams. It was Mr. Trump who claimed elections were “rigged” ever since he started running for office, including in Republican primary contests. They were rigged unless he won. In 2020 he lost about 60 court cases because there was never any evidence of “massive fraud” or fraudulent voting machines.<br />Gilbert H. Skopp"
