    "body": "A Chinese property developer on the brink of default has received approval for a debt swap, allowing it to delay payments.<br />Yango Group Co. had asked international investors earlier this month to exchange $747 million of dollar debt for new bonds, blaming a shutdown of its usual financing channels for its cash problems. It had said a successful exchange would help it avoid imminent payment defaults and, potentially, a broader restructuring of its business and its debts."
