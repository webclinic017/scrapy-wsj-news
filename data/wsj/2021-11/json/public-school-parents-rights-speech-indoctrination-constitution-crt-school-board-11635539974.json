    "body": "Philip Hamburger’s broadside against public schooling (“Is the Public School System Constitutional?” op-ed, Oct. 23) rests on an alleged violation of parental free-speech rights to decide what their children hear. This revisionist view is not what the Founders understood. In 1639 the Mather School in Massachusetts became the first publicly funded elementary school. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams encouraged taxpayer-funded schools. Adams drafted the Massachusetts constitution supporting “public schools.” Neither Jefferson nor Adams thought they were violating the free-speech rights of parents.<br />Whatever fears of foreigners occurred later had nothing to do with the Founders. Neither Catholics nor Jews formed a significant U.S. demographic then. It strains credulity to think a desire to forge an educated citizenry had as subtext the shackling of minds with Protestant indoctrination."
