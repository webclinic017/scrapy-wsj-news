    "body": "The Federal Reserve approved plans to begin scaling back its bond-buying stimulus program this month and end it by June, a major step toward withdrawing its aggressive, pandemic-driven economic support amid a recent inflation surge.<br />Fed officials in their postmeeting statement Wednesday said they still anticipated elevated inflation would fall because high readings are “largely reflecting factors that are expected to be transitory.”"
