    "body": "In the afterglow of the stunning Republican victories in Virginia—for governor, for lieutenant governor, for attorney general—the losers and their cheerleaders in the press have settled on an explanation: Glenn Youngkin waged a culture war.<br />Politico led off the day after the election, with a headline declaring “One Lesson of Virginia? The Culture War Still Works.” On MSNBC Joy Reid claimed that “education” as an issue is “code for ‘white parents don’t like the idea of teaching about race.’ ” Barack Obama planted the seed while stumping for Terry McAuliffe in Richmond, when he accused opponents of campaigning on “phony trumped-up culture wars.”"
