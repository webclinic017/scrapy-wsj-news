    "body": "Submarine movies are always suspenseful, none more so than the 1990 thriller “The Hunt for Red October.” Entertaining as it is, I never thought the film would be a source of sound child-rearing advice.<br />A few years ago, my daughters Molly and Hope ambushed their mother, Devin, and me over our Saturday morning coffee. They were both still in high school and charged us with favoring their older brother, Joe, who’d just left for college."
