    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert apologized to Muslims on Friday for a joke casting Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar as a possible suicide bomber that drew heavy criticism, with the top Republican in the House stepping in to try to tamp down the controversy.<br />Relations between the two parties have become increasingly contentious in the past year.
