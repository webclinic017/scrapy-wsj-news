    "body": "One business scandal that only just got its 15 minutes of media heat involved the crash of two Boeing 737 MAX airliners. Boeing had insisted after a Lion Air jet tumbled into the Java Sea, in October 2018, that the plane was safe. Less than five months later an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX went down too. In total, 346 people died.<br />An uproar ensued, and the 737 MAX—Boeing’s upgrade to its venerable 737—was grounded while the company worked on a fix. Hearings were held, lawsuits filed, the company’s chief executive was sent packing. Still, once the pandemic hit, the controversy faded. Peter Robison’s “Flying Blind: The 737 MAX Tragedy and the Fall of Boeing” is a disturbing account that will return much-deserved scrutiny both to Boeing and to its regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration."
