    "body": "Housekeepers are battling hotel owners’ efforts to eliminate daily room cleaning, a longtime staple of the American hospitality experience.<br />Many hotels, after suspending housekeeping at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, now clean only when guests request it.

The cutbacks also reflect staffing shortages, lower occupancies and hotel owners’ desire to reduce expenses, hotel analysts say."
