    "body": "WASHINGTON—China’s military is expanding its nuclear arsenal faster than U.S. defense officials expected, as part of an overall modernization of its armed forces to better compete militarily with the U.S., according to a Pentagon assessment.<br />At the new, accelerated pace, Beijing could have about 700 nuclear warheads in the next six years, and 1,000 by 2030, according to the annual report on Chinese military power released Wednesday. Those levels are well above the 200-plus warheads last year’s report said Beijing possessed and double the previous projections of 400 to 500 warheads by the end of the decade."
