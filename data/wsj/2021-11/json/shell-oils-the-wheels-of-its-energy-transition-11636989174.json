    "body": "Royal Dutch Shell is giving up its Dutch crown to become a more agile English commoner. It is good news for investors, though it would have been better news if the company had jumped before it was shoved.<br />The energy giant said Monday it wants to consolidate its dual British and Dutch structure into a single U.K.-based entity. It will lose its “Royal Dutch” tag and become plain Shell PLC. The move will help the company to accelerate buybacks and make portfolio changes as the energy transition picks up pace. What it won’t affect is a Dutch court ruling requiring the company to cut its emissions, though Shell might avoid other such cases once it leaves the Netherlands."
