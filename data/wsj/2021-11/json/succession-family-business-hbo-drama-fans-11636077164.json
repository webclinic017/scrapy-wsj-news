    "body": "In the HBO hit “Succession,” 80-something billionaire Logan Roy refuses to yield control of his global media conglomerate to anyone, including his four adult children, who maneuver for their father’s favor and for pecking order in his company.<br />The chief executive of a cheesecake dynasty can relate. Alan Rosen of Junior’s Restaurants and Bakery represents the third generation of his family to run the company started in 1950 in Brooklyn, N.Y. It still pains him to remember the time he says his father, Walter, grabbed his neck and punched his face during an argument over “business and transition and respect.”"
