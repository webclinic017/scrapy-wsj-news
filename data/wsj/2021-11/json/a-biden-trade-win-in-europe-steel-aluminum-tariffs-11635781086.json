    "body": "Good news for free trade is all too rare these days, so it was a relief to have some over the weekend. President Biden and his European Union counterparts made important progress in putting to bed one of the more foolhardy legacies of the Trump era, a trade war over tariffs on European steel and aluminum.<br />President Trump in 2018 slapped tariffs of 25% on steel imported from anywhere other than Canada or Mexico, and 10% on aluminum, under a trade-law provision known as Section 232. That law authorizes tariffs for the sake of national security, but Mr. Trumpâ€™s gambit hurt his domestic economic-growth agenda and goaded the EU into imposing retaliatory tariffs on a range of U.S. goods from  Harley-Davidson  motorcycles to Kentucky bourbon."
