    "body": "Michael Martocci, a 26-year-old startup founder, ignores the golf invitations and other solicitations from the  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  financial adviser trying to land him as a client.<br />Eighteen holes isn’t particularly appealing to the Miami-based Mr. Martocci, and neither is paying for financial advice.
