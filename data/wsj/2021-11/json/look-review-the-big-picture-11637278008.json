    "body": "America’s great glossy magazines were once at the pulsing heart of popular culture. Millions of readers devoured their copies of Life, Look, the Saturday Evening Post, Collier’s, the New Yorker, Reader’s Digest, Time, Newsweek, Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, Ladies’ Home Journal and more. They were rewarded with provocative stories, stunning photographs, illustrations by popular artists like Norman Rockwell, and beguiling ads for sleek new cars and other prizes of the booming consumer economy.<br />That world has all but disappeared. Most of those plump titles are gone, and the survivors often look like wraiths. It’s a shame because the slick magazines perfected forms of popular journalism, short fiction and fashion coverage that informed and entertained the country, and made fortunes for their proprietors—no small feat."
