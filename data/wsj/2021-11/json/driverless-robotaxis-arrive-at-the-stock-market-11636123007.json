    "body": "Driverless vehicles have a new public face:  Aurora Innovation .  Its stock will be a barometer of investor sentiment toward a technology that seems likely to change the world, albeit slowly.<br />The company, which is working on a package of hardware and software to automate driving, made its stock-market debut Thursday following the closure of its merger with a special-purpose acquisition company. The deal raised $1.8 billion before fees, slightly less than hoped when it was announced in July, to fund Aurora through the final two years before its targeted commercial launch. The stock fell 3% on its first trading day but rebounded at the open Friday."
