    "body": "Moderna Inc.  lowered its sales outlook for the full year and said that some planned Covid-19 vaccine deliveries will slip into early 2022.<br />Moderna now expects product sales of between $15 billion and $18 billion in 2021. In August, the company said it had signed agreements for sales of $20 billion. Now, some of those shots will likely be delivered early next year instead, Moderna said, citing longer delivery lead times for international shipments and other factors affecting the company’s production growth. It added that it has been giving priority to deliveries to low-income countries."
