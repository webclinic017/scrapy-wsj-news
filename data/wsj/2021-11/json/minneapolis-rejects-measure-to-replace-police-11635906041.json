    "body": "Voters in Minneapolis rejected a ballot measure that would have replaced the police department in the city charter with a new department of public safety in the first municipal elections since the murder of George Floyd in May 2020.<br />The new department was supposed to take a public health approach to public safety, shifting resources to social workers, violence interruption programs and others to respond to the city’s recent spate of violence in the wake of Mr. Floyd’s murder by former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin."
