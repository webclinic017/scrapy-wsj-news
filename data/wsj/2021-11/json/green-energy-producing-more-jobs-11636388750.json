    "body": "As Washington considers increasing incentives for businesses moving to a clean-energy future, one of the big questions is: Will the “greening” of the economy result in more employment or less?<br />Examples of “green jobs” include workers who build electric cars; construction contractors who install solar arrays and charging infrastructures; scientists who design carbon-capture solutions; and engineers who improve electricity grids and increase energy efficiency. Estimates vary widely on how many jobs the decarbonization of the economy could create. Those who support government action in this area see big net gains. But opponents say that a move away from fossil fuels could put nearly 600,000 U.S. jobs in oil, natural gas and coal at risk."
