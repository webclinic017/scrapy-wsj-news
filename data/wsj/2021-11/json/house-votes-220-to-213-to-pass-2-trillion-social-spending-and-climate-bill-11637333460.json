    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House passed a roughly $2 trillion education, healthcare and climate package on Friday, bringing Democrats a step closer to shepherding the core of President Biden’s economic agenda through Congress with historically narrow majorities.<br />While the 220-213 House vote largely unified Democrats’ fractious centrist and progressive wings, the party will need to move the legislation through the evenly divided Senate. There lawmakers are planning to change or pare back some of the bill’s provisions in the coming weeks."
