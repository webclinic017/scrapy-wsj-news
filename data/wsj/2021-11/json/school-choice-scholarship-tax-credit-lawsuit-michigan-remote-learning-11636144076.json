    "body": "As the editorial board notes in “School Choice Showdown in Michigan” (Nov. 2), five families are part of a lawsuit challenging a provision in Michigan’s constitution that prohibits state aid to parents who enroll their children in private K-12 schools. One of those families is mine.<br />Unfortunately, our twin boys were part of the 60% of Michigan public-school students who started last school year with remote or hybrid instruction. They spent their first day of kindergarten in front of a computer and remained there for most of the year. My sons went from happy little guys who liked school and learning to being sad and frustrated. Every morning I had to watch my two boys cry because they didn’t want to do school on computers anymore."
