    "body": "Allan Massie is not the first to claim that the Protestant Whigs invited William III to come to England in 1688 to “depose James II” and replace him on the throne (“When England Went Orange,” Bookshelf, Oct. 7). But if those had been the terms of the “invitation,” it would never have succeeded. The Tory conservatives would have (grudgingly) supported James as the legitimate sovereign, fearing a repetition of the horrible civil strife of 1642-60.<br />William was officially asked to bring his army to England to act as a referee between the Catholic reactionary James and the Whig-dominated Parliament. It was expected that a workable settlement of the outstanding political and religious issues would be hammered out and then given teeth by the presence of the Dutch forces. In three years on the throne, James had shown so much bad faith that no one had any confidence that anything less than a disinterested army could effect meaningful change. It was only when James—who had none of the personal courage of his father, Charles I—panicked and fled to France, that the Protestants decided not to look a gift horse in the mouth, and offered the throne to William and his wife Mary, who was also James’s daughter."
