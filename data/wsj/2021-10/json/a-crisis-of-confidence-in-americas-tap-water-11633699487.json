    "body": "Distrust of tap water is on the rise in the U.S. In 2018, roughly 60 million Americans didn’t drink their tap water, according to a study by researchers at Pennsylvania State University—a 40% increase compared with four years earlier.<br />The rise, which was sharpest in Black and Hispanic communities, followed the drinking-water crisis that broke out in Flint, Mich., in 2014, when a change in the city’s water source led to complaints of brown, foul-smelling water. Despite early assurances by state and federal officials that the water was safe, scientists found that it contained extraordinarily high levels of lead, a potent neurotoxin. The public health emergency hit a city already struggling with crime, job loss and a shrinking population that could barely support its infrastructure."
