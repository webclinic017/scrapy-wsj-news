    "body": "School boards are accountable to the people of the town or city they serve, to the people who elected them. They are not beholden to a national education association, the U.S. attorney general or even a U.S president (“A Dad Takes On the School Board” by William McGurn, Main Street, Oct. 12).<br />For hundreds of years, America’s schools were and largely still are built and sustained at the local town, village or city level. In New England, where the English colonists first arrived, communities built, staffed and sustained schools to prepare and educate children in a way consistent with their beliefs and values."
