    "body": "On Oct. 27, 2018, a man armed with an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle and three Glock semiautomatic pistols entered the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood and began shooting. Robert Bowers, the suspect arrested at the scene, had chosen a Saturday morning, when worshipers would be at Shabbat services. He killed 11 people and wounded six, including two SWAT officers, before he was shot and surrendered.<br />That afternoon, Greg Zanis, a 68-year-old retired carpenter from Aurora, Ill., looked at his caller ID and saw that it was his friend Anne Rosenberg. He answered, and she asked if he was going to Pittsburgh. Of course, he said. “Greg, I’ll finance you,” she said. He was always strapped for funds, as she knew, and for this trip she wanted to be his angel."
