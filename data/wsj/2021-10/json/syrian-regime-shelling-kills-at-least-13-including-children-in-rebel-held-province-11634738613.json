    "body": "At least 13 people including several children were killed Wednesday when government forces shelled a marketplace and roads in the last major section of the country held by rebels, providing a test for the fragile security alliance between Russia and Turkey.<br />The shelling on Wednesday morning took place soon after a roadside bombing in Damascus killed at least 14 people. A little known insurgent group called the Qasioun Brigade claimed responsibility on its Telegram channel for the roadside bombing, saying it acted to avenge “the daily massacres” perpetrated by the government. Its claim couldn’t be verified by The Wall Street Journal."
