    "body": "SAN JOSE, Calif.—A dermatologist testified Thursday in the criminal trial of Elizabeth Holmes that he agreed to serve as Theranos Inc.’s lab director after being asked to fill the role by one of his patients, but never did much more than sign paperwork and appear in the company’s lab once or twice.<br />Sunil Dhawan told jurors that he accepted the role in November 2014 at the request of Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, Theranos’s chief operating officer, whom he had treated for almost 15 years."
