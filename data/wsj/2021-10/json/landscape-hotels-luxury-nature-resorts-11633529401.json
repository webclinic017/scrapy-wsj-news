    "body": "BEFORE THE DOOR closed behind me, I was transfixed. As I stepped into my cabin at Piaule, a new hotel in New York’s Catskill Mountains, I faced a floor-to-ceiling, edge-to-edge wall of glass. It revealed an uninterrupted view of forest, thick with oak, hickory and maple trees—my own private IMAX-scaled nature epic.<br />When I finally turned away from the vista, I scoped out the cabin interior—pale, unfinished oak walls adorned with nothing more than delicate ceramic wall sconces; a pair of Danish folding chairs and a platform bed topped in white linens. The luxury was conspicuous enough to justify the premium hotel price ($399 a night), but not so conspicuous that it distracted from the view."
