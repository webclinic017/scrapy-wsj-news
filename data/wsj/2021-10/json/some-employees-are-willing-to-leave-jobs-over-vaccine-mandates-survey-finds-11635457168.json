    "body": "Slightly under 40% of workers who are unvaccinated say they would leave their job if getting the Covid-19 vaccine was mandated by their employer or if they were required to get tested for the virus weekly, according to the results of a new survey.<br />Even more unvaccinated workers—seven out of 10—would leave their jobs if their employers instituted a vaccine mandate and there wasn’t an option to get tested weekly, according to results from the Kaiser Family Foundation Covid-19 Vaccine Monitor. The survey took place Oct. 14-24 and polled 1,519 adults in the U.S."
