    "body": "‘It’s National Noodle Day,” said the Wednesday email from P.F. Chang’s. Thanks to the geniuses on Madison Avenue, every day is an occasion. “Celebrate today with your favorite noodle dish,” I was advised. According to NationalToday.com, which tracks such things, Oct. 6 was also World Cerebral Palsy Day, National Walk and Bike to School Day, National Plus Size Appreciation Day and—I’m not kidding—National Transfer Money to Your Daughter Day.<br />Widely recognized holidays sometimes have obscure tie-ins. Monday is Columbus Day, but it’s also National Sausage Pizza Day. Halloween doubles as Visit a Cemetery Day and National Knock Knock Joke Day."
