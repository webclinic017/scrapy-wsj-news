    "body": "As energy prices soar around the world, the key assumption behind President Biden’s foreign policy faces a severe test. That assumption is that aggressively backing the transition from fossil fuels to renewables will strengthen the administration’s hand at home and abroad.<br />Bidenites think that climate offers an opportunity to pry Democratic greens and harder-left progressives apart. The deep-blue progressives want massive cuts in the military budget and a wholesale reorientation of American foreign policy toward longtime left-wing goals. Overall, the idea is a transformation of American budget priorities toward domestic spending."
