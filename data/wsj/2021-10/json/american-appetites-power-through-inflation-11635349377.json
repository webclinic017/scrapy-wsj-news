    "body": "Strong earnings from  McDonald’s ,   Kraft Heinz  and  Coca-Cola  show America’s food and beverage giants have what it takes to overcome inflationary pressures.<br />The burger, ketchup and soda companies make for an appetizing trio in more ways than one. All three reported results on Wednesday that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines, sending share prices higher in morning trading. For that, they can largely thank strong customer demand, even in the face of price increases."
