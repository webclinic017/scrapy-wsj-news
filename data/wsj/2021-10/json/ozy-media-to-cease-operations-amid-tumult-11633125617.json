    "body": "Ozy Media said it would cease operations, less than a week after a  New York Times  article raising questions about the company’s business practices led to high-profile departures and a pullback from some major advertisers.<br />“At Ozy, we have been blessed with a remarkable team of dedicated staff. Many of them are world-class journalists and experienced professionals to whom we owe tremendous gratitude and who are wonderful colleagues. It is therefore with the heaviest of hearts that we must announce today that we are closing Ozy’s doors,” the board said in a statement Friday."
