    "body": "THE CLICK-CLACK of suitcases being rolled along the cobblestone alleyways is back. So too is the occasional pause in the luggage cacophony when tourists lift their bags to lug them up and down this city’s endless succession of bridges. But while Venice has once again become a busy tourist destination, the city reveals two tales. On the weekends, you need fancy footwork and aggressive elbowing to get a prime viewing spot of the Grand Canal from the Rialto Bridge. On weekdays, Venice still preserves some of the relative tranquility that characterized it during the pandemic. An unobstructed view of the Bridge of Sighs can be had without any particular maneuvering and the crowds in the alleyways near St. Mark’s Square vanish quickly.<br />According to the most recent government data available, Venice welcomed about 60% fewer tourists in June and July of this year than in the same two months of 2019. But while the number of foreigners dropped by 70% in those two months, almost 50% more Italian tourists came to Venice, many on weekend day trips."
