    "body": "Loose-leaf tea seller Plum Deluxe used to gain a new customer for every $27 it spent on Facebook and Instagram ads. Then,  Apple Inc.  introduced a privacy change restricting how users are tracked on mobile devices.<br />Now, the company spends as much as $270 to pick up a new customer. “That’s a huge jump and one that we just can’t absorb,” said Andy Hayes, founder of Plum Deluxe of Portland, Ore., which is now cutting its spending."
