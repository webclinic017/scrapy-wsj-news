    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Justice Department on Friday said it would soon file a request with the Supreme Court seeking to block enforcement of a Texas law that bans many abortions in the state.<br />The department’s plans, announced by a spokesman, will pose a new test for the high court just weeks after the justices, on a 5-4 vote, declined to prevent the law from taking effect in September."
