    "body": "Former Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas was convicted of campaign-finance charges Friday, capping the fall of a key figure in the first impeachment of former President Donald Trump.<br />After five hours of deliberating, a federal jury in Manhattan found Mr. Parnas guilty of all six counts. The trial lasted nearly two weeks, with federal prosecutors portraying Mr. Parnas as a Florida businessman with little political experience who began making large donations to campaigns in 2018 to gain influence with candidates in Washington, D.C., and around the country."
