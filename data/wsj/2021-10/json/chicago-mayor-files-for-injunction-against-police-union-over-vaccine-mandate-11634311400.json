    "body": "CHICAGO—Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the local Fraternal Order of Police on Friday said they had filed competing motions for injunctions against each other, escalating a fight over Chicago’s vaccination policy.<br />The city’s filing alleges the union’s president was encouraging an illegal work stoppage or strike by telling members not to let the city know their vaccination status. The union later asked a court to stop the city from enforcing its vaccination-notification requirement, saying it amounted to an unnegotiated change in the labor contract."
