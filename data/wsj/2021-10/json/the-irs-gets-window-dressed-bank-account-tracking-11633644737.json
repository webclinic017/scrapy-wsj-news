    "body": "Despite their growing aversion to private business, House Democrats grasp the concept of “sticker shock.” Many Americans reeled when they learned that the Internal Revenue Service plans to track bank accounts with yearly cash flow as small as $600. Legislators may now raise that number to $10,000, but don’t buy it—the effect of the policy would hardly change.<br />The controversy surrounds a provision the House Ways and Means Committee tucked into the Democrats’ $5 trillion spending bill. The rule would require banks to report annual deposit and spending totals for ordinary account holders. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has championed the change, telling CNBC on Tuesday that it “would really help the IRS target their auditing resources.”"
