    "body": "A federal judge extended an order requiring New York state to allow religious exemptions from its Covid-19 vaccination mandate for healthcare workers, in a ruling that could help shape the legal landscape around government-required shots.<br />In August, the New York State Department of Health said hospital and nursing-home workers would have to be vaccinated against Covid-19 within 30 days. Although there were provisions for medical exemptions, there were none based on religious beliefs, and when the mandate took effect last month, thousands of healthcare workers who refused vaccinations lost their jobs."
