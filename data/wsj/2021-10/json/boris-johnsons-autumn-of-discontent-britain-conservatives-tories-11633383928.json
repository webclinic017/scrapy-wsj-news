    "body": "It’s hard to believe it’s less than two years since U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson won a historic electoral mandate on a platform of getting Brexit done and unleashing Britain’s economic dynamism. It’s also hard to recall the last time anything went right for him, leaving his Conservatives in a precarious spot as they hold their annual convention this week.<br />Failures are accumulating. For the past week it’s been gas lines as fuel companies struggle to deliver gasoline and diesel to filling stations. The main culprit appears to be a shortage of truck drivers, a common theme in many countries. But it’s worse in Britain owing to post-Brexit immigration restrictions on drivers from Eastern Europe and tax and other policies that discourage those already in the country from staying."
