    "body": "Edward D. Miller grew up in Brooklyn’s rough Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. His early jobs included selling pretzels on the streets and bartending. After studying engineering at Brooklyn College for two years, he dropped out and took a clerical job at Manufacturers Hanover Trust, known as Manny Hanny.<br />With neither a business degree nor Ivy League polish, he might have seemed unlikely to go far in New York banking. After serving in the U.S. Marines in the early 1960s, however, Mr. Miller returned to Manny Hanny and slotted himself into a management-training program. At the age of 29, he was promoted to overhaul the company’s unprofitable credit-card business. Success there led to a series of further promotions."
