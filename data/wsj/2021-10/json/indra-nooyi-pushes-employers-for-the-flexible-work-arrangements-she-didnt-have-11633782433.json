    "body": "Even when Indra Nooyi reached the top of one of the biggest companies in the world, the former  PepsiCo Inc.  boss says she had to contend with sexism in her own board room, where a couple of male directors routinely talked over her.<br />In her new memoir, “My Life in Full: Work, Family, and Our Future,” she recounts how, as one of India’s first female M.B.A. graduates, she rose to become chairman and chief executive of the soda-and-snacks giant. She describes encountering a business climate that was inhospitable for families in which both parents worked. Ms. Nooyi says she and her husband struggled to find reliable child care and cobbled together informal arrangements, leaning on her mother and flying relatives over from India for monthslong stints."
