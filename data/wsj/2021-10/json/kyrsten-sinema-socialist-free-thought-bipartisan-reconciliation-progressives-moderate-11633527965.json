    "body": "‘Hi, I’m Kyrsten. I’m in the Arizona House and I’m a socialist.” That’s how the woman who’s now her state’s senior U.S. senator introduced herself to me when we met at an immigration conference in 2006. I found her to be more complicated than a slogan. I told her I worked for a federally sponsored job-training program in college and learned that she is a former social worker who is suspicious of impersonal bureaucracies and genuinely curious about other people.<br />Lately she’s become a pariah on the left for her skepticism of the $3.5 trillion Biden budget extravaganza. Detractors harassed her in a public restroom to cheers from some media figures. “Saturday Night Live” portrayed her as an obstructionist who’s too ditsy to know what she wants. There’s talk of a primary challenge in 2024."
