    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The Biden administration intends to ease Covid-19 travel restrictions on land-border crossings from Canada and Mexico and will require foreign nationals taking those routes into the U.S. for nonessential reasons to show proof of vaccination beginning in November.<br />The new rules from the Department of Homeland Security will amend land-travel restrictions first imposed by the Trump administration in 2020 that have become a source of frustration for the Canadian and Mexican governments and for U.S. border cities, particularly as Covid-19 vaccines have become widely available across the U.S."
