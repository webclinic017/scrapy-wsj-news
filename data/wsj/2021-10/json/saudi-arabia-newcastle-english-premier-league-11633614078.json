    "body": "Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund on Thursday struck a deal to acquire Newcastle United in the English Premier League, giving it a foothold in the world’s most popular sports enterprise after more than two years of on and off talks.<br />The investor group, led by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment and including British financier Amanda Staveley and the billionaire Reuben brothers, had pulled out of a $380 million deal last year after the Premier League spent months scrutinizing the Saudi state’s involvement."
