    "body": "The World Health Organization on Wednesday recommended the widespread deployment of the world’s first malaria vaccine to young children in sub-Saharan Africa and other at-risk regions, hoping to revive the fight against the mosquito-borne illness that kills more than 400,000 people every year.<br />The endorsement from the WHO—a crucial step for getting more investment in the production and rollout of the shot—comes more than three decades after scientists at what is now  GlaxoSmithKline  PLC started developing the vaccine."
