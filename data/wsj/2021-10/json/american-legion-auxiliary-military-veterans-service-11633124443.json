    "body": "Thank you for recognizing the impact veterans-service organizations have had on U.S. communities for over 100 years (“Old Veterans Organizations Are Fading Away” by Faith Bottum, op-ed, Sept. 24). While numbers in service organizations are declining for reasons Ms. Bottum cites, my perspective as a member and employee of the American Legion Auxiliary tells a different story of vitality, creativity and passion.<br />A few years ago I met a member from Florida who agreed to take care of her neighbor’s dog when he was called up to active duty. Last I knew, she had become a hub connecting military pets with safe temporary homes. A group in Wisconsin bought a handicap-accessible utility task vehicle to enable veterans who are disabled to access nature trails. Members in Connecticut work with the Veterans Affairs unit for the blind to provide quarters so those veterans can learn how to operate laundromat equipment. None of these members set out to start a movement, but in some cases it happened anyway. Lots of people doing small acts adds up to improved lives for our military families."
