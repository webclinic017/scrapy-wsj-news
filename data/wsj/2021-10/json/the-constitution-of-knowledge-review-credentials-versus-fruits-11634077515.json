    "body": "The experts who staff America’s universities, newspapers, law firms and government agencies are sufficiently numerous and powerful to constitute a class—the knowledge class. It isn’t exactly an honor to be counted among them. Decades of debacles—foreign-policy blunders, the 2008 financial crisis, the ObamaCare rollout—have undermined the credibility of the credentialed. Our would-be knowers often seem little more than self-dealing, blinkered elites. Many wonder if we would be better off without them.<br />In “The Constitution of Knowledge,” Jonathan Rauch makes a convincing case that we still need our institutions of expertise and the people who work for them. Mr. Rauch, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, argues that human beings have a natural tendency to believe whatever they wish, irrespective of evidence. Our institutions of expertise incentivize intellectual rigor through practices such as peer review and fact checking, which help tame this tendency."
