    "body": "WASHINGTON—A trading frenzy in shares of  GameStop Corp.  this year raised a number of questions for regulators but didn’t expose major weaknesses in stock-market infrastructure, the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Monday.<br />A highly anticipated SEC report attributed the episode primarily to a rapid increase in trading by individual investors, many of whom used social-media platforms like Redditto swap ideas and strategies. The agency poured cold water on a number of alternative hypotheses for why the struggling videogame retailer’s share price soared to an intraday high of $483 on Jan. 28 from less than $20 at the end of 2020."
