    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden’s Supreme Court commission split sharply Friday over increasing the number of justices, with conservative members questioning whether Congress held the power to do so and liberals arguing that expansion could be the only plausible remedy to what they view as a constitutional crisis.<br />Friday’s meeting was the first public debate by the 36-member commission, which Mr. Biden appointed in April in part to defuse Democratic frustration over Republican actions that have produced a 6-3 conservative majority on the court."
