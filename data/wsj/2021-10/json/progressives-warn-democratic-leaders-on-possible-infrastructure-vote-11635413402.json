    "body": "WASHINGTON—Progressive Democrats are warning party leaders that they could vote against the long-stalled bipartisan infrastructure bill even after the White House released a new framework for its $1.85 trillion social-spending and climate bill.<br />The continued threats from progressives come as Democrats were hoping to hold a vote on the roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill, which includes about $550 billion in new spending, as soon as this week. Passing the package would show momentum for President Biden’s agenda, as he travels to the Glasgow climate summit and voters head to the polls in gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey. The bill would also reauthorize highway funding that is set to expire this weekend."
