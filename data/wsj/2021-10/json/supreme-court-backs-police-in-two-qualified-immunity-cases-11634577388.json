    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court threw out two separate excessive-force lawsuits filed against police, ruling Monday that the doctrine of qualified immunity protected the officers from having to answer the allegations in court.<br />Qualified immunity—the doctrine that police officers and other officials can’t be sued for misconduct unless they have violated “clearly established” rights—has come under scrutiny by critics who argue it too often gives legal protection to police misconduct. Following last year’s police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and other Democrats proposed scrapping the court-made doctrine, but initial efforts toward a bipartisan agreement to overhaul the legal framework for police conduct reached a stalemate."
