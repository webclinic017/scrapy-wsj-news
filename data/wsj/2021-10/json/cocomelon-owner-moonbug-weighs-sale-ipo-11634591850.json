    "body": "Moonbug Entertainment Ltd., the company behind the hit children’s show “CoCoMelon,” is looking to cash in on its popularity by either selling itself or going public, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />“CoCoMelon,” with its lilting nursery rhymes on subjects like putting on shoes, has been a breakout hit of the Covid-19 pandemic, with busy parents parking their children in front of the TV to sing along with computer-generated toddlers. It became even more popular when  Netflix Inc.  in July struck a deal to launch a spinoff of the series for three seasons."
