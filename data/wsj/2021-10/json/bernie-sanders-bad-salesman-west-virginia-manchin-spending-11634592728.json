    "body": "If you were a Democrat appealing to the good people of West Virginia, is Bernie Sanders the guy you’d want making your pitch?<br />Yet that’s exactly what happened Friday, when Mr. Sanders published an op-ed in West Virginia’s largest newspaper, the Charleston Gazette-Mail. It was an act of war directed at Sen. Joe Manchin, who Mr. Sanders notes is one of two Democrats standing in the way of the $3.5 trillion progressive wish list that is the stalled reconciliation bill. It didn’t help that Mr. Sanders characterized opponents as Republicans and others who “want to maintain the status quo in which the very rich get richer while ordinary Americans continue to struggle to make ends meet.” Presumably that includes Mr. Manchin."
