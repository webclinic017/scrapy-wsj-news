    "body": "As television cameras scan the seats during the World Series, viewers at home will see fans dressed in the jerseys of their favorite teams, texting friends to let them know they’re at the game or waving wildly at the lenses zooming in on them. TV viewers likely won’t spot a once-commonplace baseball standby: fans with stubby pencils leaning intently over cardboard scorecards, keeping track of every pitch, hit, strikeout and run.<br />It was a universal ritual at every ballpark, major league or minor. Fans would buy a scorecard for as little as a dime when they arrived, and by marking up little boxes that demarcated each inning they kept a running account of the game."
