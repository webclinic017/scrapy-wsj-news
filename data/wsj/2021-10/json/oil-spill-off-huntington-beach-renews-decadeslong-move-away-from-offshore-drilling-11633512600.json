    "body": "Offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico produces more crude oil in 2.8 days than the West Coast produces in an entire year. But a few decades ago, California’s coastline was humming with activity. In 1995, the West Coast produced 92 million barrels from California’s offshore reserves, according to estimates by the Energy Information Administration. By 2019, that number had plummeted to 13 million.<br />In 2020, offshore federal production accounted for 15% of all crude-oil production, most of it from the Gulf of Mexico. California is part of the third-largest U.S. oil-producing region, PADD 5, which also includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon and Washington, as well as the Pacific Outer continental shelf.  There are currently 23 oil-and-gas production facilities in federal waters, installed between the late 1960s and 1990. There are four more platforms in California’s waters."
