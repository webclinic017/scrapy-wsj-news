    "body": "Forget what you’ve heard about the downfall of organized labor. A spate of strikes across the country is highlighting the power of unions amid today’s national worker shortage, with potentially damaging consequences for the continuing nationwide supply problems.<br />The biggest strike came after midnight Thursday when more than 10,000  Deere  & Co. employees walked off the job. Workers on Oct. 10 overwhelmingly rejected a deal for wage and benefit increases negotiated by their United Auto Workers reps."
