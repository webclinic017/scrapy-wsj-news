    "body": "The alarms raised by Walter Russell Mead (“In Europe, Confusion Reigns About the U.S.,” Global View, Oct. 26) should be heeded. Europe may no longer be a priority, but no U.S. president will ever be able to dismiss the continent as irrelevant. At the same time, few policy makers in Washington realize how badly the reputation of the U.S. has been damaged by recent and, as Mr. Mead rightly notes, prospective instability.<br />Confusion is pervasive, and counterproductive attitudes are making it worse on both sides of the Atlantic. But what should President Biden try to achieve in Europe to repair these rifts and put the trans-Atlantic relationship on firmer footing?"
