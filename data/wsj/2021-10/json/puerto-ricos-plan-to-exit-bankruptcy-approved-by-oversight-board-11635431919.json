    "body": "The federal board overseeing Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy agreed Thursday to drop its opposition to legislation enacted earlier this week authorizing the island to raise new debt needed to complete its debt restructuring plan.<br />The disagreement between the oversight board and the U.S. territory’s government had concerned public worker pensions, among other matters. Resolving the disagreement averts the threat that a restructuring plan negotiated over four years could be discarded and the case dismissed by a bankruptcy judge."
