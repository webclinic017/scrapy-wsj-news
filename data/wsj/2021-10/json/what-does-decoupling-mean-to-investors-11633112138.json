    "body": "Over the past year, investors have seen the term “decoupling” often. However, it is likely to confuse people because it had one definition for decades, while now it has another. The two meanings are related, but they aren’t the same.<br />The first “decoupling” has its origins decades ago. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, America reigned supreme among world economies and experts considered it the locomotive of global economic growth. In other words, the global economy didn’t grow without U.S. leadership. But as other countries rebuilt and recovered from the carnage of war, some economists thought there might be a decoupling of the U.S. economy from world growth, with other countries taking up the economic-growth leadership."
