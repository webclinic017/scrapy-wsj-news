    "body": "<br />After a season of anxiety, fragmented attention spans and the incessant drumbeat of headlines, it’s more than usually wonderful to report the arrival of new works of fiction that promise immersion, reflection and the particular delights of storytelling. This season our reviewers highlight long-awaited new work from writers such as Jonathan Franzen, Anthony Doerr and Gayl Jones, transporting readers to settings from 17th-century Brazil to a 1970s church group and on to a spacefaring future. Dive in."
