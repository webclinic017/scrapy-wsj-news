    "body": "Regarding Peggy Noonan’s “What Milley Got Right—and Wrong” (Declarations, Sept. 25): Gen. Mark Milley is chairman of the Joint Chiefs, not the director or dictator of our military services. An adviser to the president and secretary of defense, he is supposed to work with the chiefs and commanders of the military services.<br />As chairman, he is not charged with determining the mental state of the president. As chairman, he reports his concerns to the secretary of defense, not to a foreign government. His “counterpart” in the Chinese Communist government is not in his chain of command. The charter for the chairman does not include saving the nation from a rogue president. His duties do not include eliminating “white rage” from the ranks."
