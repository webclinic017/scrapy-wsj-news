    "body": "Rep. John Yarmuth, the chairman of the House Budget Committee and a central figure in advancing President Biden’s agenda through Congress, said on Tuesday that he wouldn’t run for re-election next year.<br />First elected to the House in 2006, Mr. Yarmuth (D., Ky.) represents what is currently a safely blue seat in the Louisville area. As the chairman of the budget panel, he has been closely involved in crafting both the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill Democrats passed earlier this year and the broader social-policy and climate bill the party is currently working on."
