    "body": "WASHINGTON—Former President Donald Trump’s adviser Steve Bannon said he wouldn’t cooperate with the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, while President Biden rejected Mr. Trump’s attempt to assert executive privilege over records related to the attack.<br />Deeming the riot by Trump supporters while Congress was certifying Mr. Biden’s victory “a dark day in democracy,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Mr. Biden believes in the importance of providing Congress and the public a complete understanding of the events “to prevent them from happening again.”"
