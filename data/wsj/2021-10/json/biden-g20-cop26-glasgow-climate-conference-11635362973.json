    "body": "President Biden will push allies to do more to confront climate change and seek progress on a global minimum tax during a foreign trip that follows a bumpy stretch on the world stage and struggles to advance his agenda at home.<br />Following a celebratory trip overseas in June aimed at strengthening U.S. alliances, Mr. Biden’s five-day tour to Italy and Scotland will include efforts to ease recent tensions. His administration is coping with frustration over the U.S. exit from Afghanistan and a diplomatic dust-up with France after it was cut out of a deal to supply nuclear submarines to Australia."
