    "body": "A federal appeals court ruled a California law that bans private prisons canâ€™t stand because it impedes on federal immigration policy.<br />The law, which went into effect last year, prohibits the state from entering and renewing private prison contracts, and bans their use after Jan. 1, 2028. It includes for-profit immigrant-detention facilities run by private companies on behalf of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement."
