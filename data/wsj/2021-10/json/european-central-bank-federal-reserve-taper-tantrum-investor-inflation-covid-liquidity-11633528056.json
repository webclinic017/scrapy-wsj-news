    "body": "Do you have too much money? Losing sleep over that ballooning bank account? Perhaps not. But spare a thought for Jerome Powell and Christine Lagarde, who must lead us all out of a global monetary glut. Facing essentially the same pandemic-era problem, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have come to the same solution: drastically cut monthly net asset purchases. Unfortunately for financial markets, they will be pulling back at the same time, setting up 2022 as the year of the “taper tandem”—the fastest liquidity drain in a decade.<br />Monetary data indicate that advanced economies are awash in money, thanks to central banks’ voracious buying of financial assets. In March 2020, amid financial panic over Covid-19, the New York Fed was creating money to buy up to $75 billion of assets every day. Around the same time, the ECB announced an emergency program targeting €1.85 trillion ($2.15 trillion) of purchases in total. Plentiful liquidity helped governments, businesses and households survive lockdowns. Cash flows collapsed but bankruptcies barely increased. Asset markets and the real economy exited the crisis on a strong footing."
