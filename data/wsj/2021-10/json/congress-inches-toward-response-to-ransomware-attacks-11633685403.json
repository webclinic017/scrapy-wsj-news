    "body": "CONGRESS, FEDS MAKE MOVES ON RANSOMWARE ATTACKS, but a clear fix for the expensive cybercrime epidemic is far from clear. The Senate Homeland Security Committee took a step forward on Wednesday, advancing a bill that would require hospitals and oil and natural-gas pipeline companies, among other critical infrastructure operators, to report cyberattacks and ransom payments within 72 hours. Chairman Gary Peters said he wants the bill tacked onto the broader annual defense authorization package.<br />Who is responsible for reporting ransomware attacks remains a point of contention. Florida GOP Sen. Rick Scott didn’t want reporting requirements for small businesses and Ohio Sen. Rob Portman successfully added an amendment to exempt small businesses from having to tell the government they paid a ransom. Sen. Elizabeth Warren introduced a separate reporting requirement bill for a broader group of companies and public entities—it exempts individuals—that pay ransoms to regain access to their computer systems so federal authorities will have more comprehensive data on the extent of the problem."
