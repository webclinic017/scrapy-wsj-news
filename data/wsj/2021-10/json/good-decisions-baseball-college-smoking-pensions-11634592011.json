    "body": "I made one awful life-changing decision when I was 18 to walk out onto an icy ledge to escape my college dorm room after my roommate locked me in as a prank. I fell and have been partly disabled ever since. But I’ve made some good decisions too.<br />Perhaps the best decision was something I chose not to do—smoke cigarettes. Now that I’m 83, many of my contemporaries who were dedicated smokers are long gone. I think especially of the wonderful Bart Giamatti, who preceded me as Major League Baseball Commissioner and who once confessed sardonically that the only thing he did at a world-class level was smoke cigarettes. He smoked five packs a day and died at 51 of a heart attack."
