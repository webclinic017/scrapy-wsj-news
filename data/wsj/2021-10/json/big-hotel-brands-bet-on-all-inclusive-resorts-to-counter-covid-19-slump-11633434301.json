    "body": "Big hotel companies are adding more all-inclusive resorts, betting that the pandemic will boost a business model that encourages guests to stay in one place.<br />These resorts, where customers pay a flat fee that covers their room, food, drinks and other services, have recovered from the shock of the pandemic faster than other types of hotels, analysts say. They typically cater to tourists, who have been more eager to take trips again than business travelers. And they appeal to safety-conscious travelers who want to stay in one place to limit the risk of Covid-19 infection."
