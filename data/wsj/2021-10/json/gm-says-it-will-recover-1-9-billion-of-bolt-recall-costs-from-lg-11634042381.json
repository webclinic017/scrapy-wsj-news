    "body": "General Motors Co. said it would recover from supplier LG Electronics Inc. nearly all of the $2 billion cost of recalling Chevrolet Bolt electric models for the risk of battery fires.<br />GM said Tuesday that LG would reimburse the car maker because of manufacturing defects in battery modules supplied by the Korean company. GM in August expanded a previous recall to include all of the roughly 142,000 Bolts that the auto makerÂ has produced since 2016, citing a likely manufacturing flaw that has been linked to at least 13 fires."
