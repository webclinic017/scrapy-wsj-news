    "body": "Expensive cotton is in vogue again and apparel company investors aren’t too happy about it.<br />Cotton prices have surged 18% over the past month, and 42.5% year to date, to levels last seen roughly a decade ago. That has sent shares of apparel companies—including denim-maker  Levi Strauss —tumbling. On Wednesday alone, Levi’s shares were down 5.1% while the S&P 500 index was up 0.4%. Fast-fashion retailers  H&M  and  Inditex  were down 4.9% and 4.6%, respectively, while Gap shares fell 2.2%."
