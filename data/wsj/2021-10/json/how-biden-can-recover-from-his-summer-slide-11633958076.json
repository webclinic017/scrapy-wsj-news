    "body": "It’s funny how August, which is supposed to be a quiet month, so often turns into a disastrous one for presidents. And so it was for President Biden this year, bringing about a slide from which he has yet to recover.<br />The disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, the resulting tensions with allies, a surge in the coronavirus Delta variant, a stall-out in his domestic agenda amid nasty intraparty fighting, the continuation of a summertime surge in illegal border crossings—all merged into a kind of toxic brew. The president’s job approval rating in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls fell from 51.3% on the first day of August to 46.3% on its last, and has slid further since, to 43.3% this week."
