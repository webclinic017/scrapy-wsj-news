    "body": "SINGAPORE—Myanmar’s military junta will be excluded from a regional summit in late October, foiling the regime’s latest bid for international legitimacy and ratcheting up pressure on the country to cooperate with neighbors on resolving its political crisis.<br />The Southeast Asian nation has been in turmoil since its military seized power on Feb. 1, overthrowing an elected government, imprisoning its leaders and suppressing pro-democracy protests with violence that human rights groups say has left more than 1,000 people dead."
