    "body": "Harry Jackson left the Fairfax County School Board meeting Thursday night feeling frustrated. The father of a Thomas Jefferson High School sophomore, he had signed up to address the board about sexually explicit material in the school library, including work he and other parents say normalizes pedophilia. But the list of speakers ended right before his two minutes at the mic.<br />A student who did speak that evening defended the contested material, saying “there is nothing that is inappropriate unless you go looking for it.” Mr. Jackson takes it as a backhanded admission. “I am glad to see we agree there’s pornographic material in the library,” he says."
