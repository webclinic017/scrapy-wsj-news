    "body": "Ross Douthat is a New York Times op-ed columnist who vaulted to his perch in 2009 at the age of only 30—which may explain why his columns can sometimes read like seminar submissions. Yet this too-earnest quality is only rarely apparent in “The Deep Places”—Mr. Douthat’s sixth and latest book—a harrowing, and often profound, account of how one man’s life can be laid almost to waste by Fate.<br />In his “memoir of illness and discovery,” Mr. Douthat tells us of his descent into a netherworld of consternation, paranoia and despair after contracting a chronic form of Lyme disease six years ago. Although he experienced physical pain that was often unbearable, he was stonewalled and scoffed at by skeptical doctors who refused to accept the existence of a long-lingering form of Lyme."
