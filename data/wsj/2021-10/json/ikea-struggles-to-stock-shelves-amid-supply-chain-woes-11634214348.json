    "body": "IKEA, the world’s largest furniture seller, said a significant share of its products are missing from store shelves around the world, with many of its flatpacks and houseware items sitting idle at warehouses waiting for trucks.<br />The problem “is very global from where we sit,” said Tolga Öncü, retail operations manager at Ingka Holding B.V., the family-controlled retailer’s main holding company and the operator of the majority of IKEA’s outlets. IKEA has its products in warehouses in most cases, but fewer ways to get them to stores because of transportation strains in many of its biggest markets."
