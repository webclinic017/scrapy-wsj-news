    "body": "LONDON— Royal Dutch Shell PLC  pledged to halve its carbon-dioxide emissions by 2030, a day after activist investor Third Point LLC called for the breakup of the energy giant to improve its environmental and financial performances.<br />The company said Thursday that after “ongoing stakeholder engagement” it would reduce by 50% the carbon emissions under its operational control by the end of the decade compared with 2016 levels, though stopped short of promising to cut emissions linked to the use of its products."
