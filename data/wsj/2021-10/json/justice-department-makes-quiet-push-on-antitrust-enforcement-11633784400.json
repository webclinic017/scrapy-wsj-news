    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The Justice Department has been quietly ramping up antitrust enforcement under the Biden administration, despite not having a politically confirmed official to serve as antitrust chief.<br />The department shares antitrust authority with the Federal Trade Commission, whose new liberal leadership has drawn much of the early spotlight. Yet in recent months the DOJ has blocked a major insurance-industry merger between  Aon  PLC and rival  Willis Towers Watson  PLC; filed an aggressive challenge to a partnership between  American Airlines Group Inc.  and  JetBlue Airways Corp. ; and withdrawn from a real-estate industry settlement in order to take a deeper look at whether industry practices keep some broker commissions artificially high."
