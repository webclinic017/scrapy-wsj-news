    "body": "Parents might want to fill up the freezer with fish sticks, but at least Catholics are a long way from Lent. Millions of pounds of Alaskan seafood remain stranded en route to the East Coast, amid a fight over one of America’s dumbest laws. A federal judge last week declined to unstick the supply chain, at least for now, meaning things could get worse.<br />The seafood became trapped in Bayside, a Canadian port near Maine, when Customs and Border Protection in August began issuing millions of dollars in fines for alleged violations of the Jones Act. This 1920 law says cargo shipped domestically must travel via vessels built in the U.S. and 75% crewed by Americans. The Alaskan fish went aboard ships that don’t qualify."
