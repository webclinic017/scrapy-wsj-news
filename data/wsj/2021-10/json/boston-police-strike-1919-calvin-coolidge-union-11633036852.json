    "body": "In his review of Calvin Coolidge’s autobiography (Bookshelf, Sept. 25), Barton Swaim notes that Coolidge ascended to national office because Republicans “admired the skill with which, as governor of Massachusetts, he put down the Boston Police Strike of 1919.” Mr. Swaim could have added the memorable statement at the heart of Gov. Coolidge’s decisive action: “There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, any time.”<br />Coolidge showed that in a public emergency a conservative Republican could boldly assert the primacy of the broad public interest over private action—a lesson that some current Republican governors would do well to keep in mind as our nation continues to fight the coronavirus."
