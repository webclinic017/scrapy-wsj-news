    "body": "Climate negotiators from nearly every country will gather for two weeks in early November in Glasgow, Scotland, to hammer out a new agreement to limit global warming. The meeting is officially called the 26th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. A COP has taken place every year since 1995, except last year, when it was canceled due to Covid-19. The U.K. is hosting this year’s meeting, called COP26. The aim is to push along commitments made in the Paris Agreement.<br />The Paris Agreement, signed in 2015 at COP21, is the most ambitious U.N. deal yet to tackle climate change. Governments agreed on a collective goal to limit the earth’s warming by the end of the century to well under two degrees Celsius compared with the preindustrial era, and to strive to keep warming to 1.5 degrees. To achieve that goal, they agreed to submit national plans to limit their emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which most scientists agree are the primary drivers of global warming."
