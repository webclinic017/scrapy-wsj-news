    "body": "Germanyâ€™s  CureVac  NV said it would shelve its most advanced Covid-19 vaccine and focus on a new version, in the latest sign that efforts to develop vaccines against the virus are entering a new phase, centered on next-generation shots.<br />The initial rush of pandemic vaccine development appears to have ended with only a handful of clear winners, immunization drives across the Western world are dominated by shots made by  Pfizer Inc.  with partner  BioNTech SE ,   AstraZeneca  PLC and  Moderna Inc.  The field may be narrowing further as dozens of countries now clamor for supplies of the Pfizer vaccine, drawn by its high level of efficacy and a lack of concerns over rare side effects."
