    "body": "Banks are moving past the pandemic that sent quarterly profits on a wild ride. That is drawing attention to their weak spots.<br />America’s biggest banks report third-quarter earnings this week, starting with  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. on Wednesday. Analysts expect banks in the S&P 500 to report aggregate profits of about $31 billion, up about 20% from a year ago but down 20% from the second quarter, according to FactSet. Profits are expected to hold steady in the fourth quarter."
