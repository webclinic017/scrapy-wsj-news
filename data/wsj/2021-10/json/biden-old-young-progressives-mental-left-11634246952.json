    "body": "Have we failed the youngest generations of our citizens? The radical progressive movement (“Progressives Hold the Capital Captive” by Peggy Noonan, Declarations, Oct. 9) is in large part the domain of young, entitled people who have been coddled before they have made their first contribution to society. They heap scorn on their country, using modern norms to judge the actions of those who lived by their wits, character and strength in times past—times in which the young progressives would have been found wanting.<br />They have no expectation of being asked to serve and defend the country they will inherit. They demand that we, the older generations, step aside while they change the core of what makes our country great. But as Ms. Noonan states, “Ideological aggression isn’t working.” We resent it. These young tyrants might contemplate the words attributed to a famous Japanese admiral after he led the attack against our country: “I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.”"
