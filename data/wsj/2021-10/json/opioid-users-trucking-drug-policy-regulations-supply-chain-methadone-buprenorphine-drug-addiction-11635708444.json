    "body": "You’ve heard about supply-chain disruptions causing shortages and inflation, but here’s a surprising contributor: misguided drug policy. The U.S. trucking industry is short some 80,000 drivers in a country where more than 70% of commercial goods reach their destination via truck. One reason is that the U.S. Department of Transportation makes it extremely difficult for would-be truckers to obtain commercial driver’s licenses if they’re being treated for opioid-use disorder with buprenorphine or methadone. States have even revoked licenses of patients who had been driving safely for years, solely because they took their medication as prescribed.<br />The problem arises in part from contradictory regulations. Two federal rules allow commercial drivers to take controlled substances if prescribed by a medical practitioner who has concluded they won’t impair the ability to drive safely. But two other regulations state that commercial-driving employers aware of controlled substance use by employees shouldn’t permit them to drive, with no clear distinction between medical and nonmedical use."
