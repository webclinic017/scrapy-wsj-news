    "body": "Opposition by the American Dental Association (ADA) to proposed legislation to provide dental benefits through Medicare Part B runs counter to the popularity of the legislation among many dentists and the general public (“Dentists’ Group Fights Medicare Coverage,” U.S. News, Sept. 28).<br />The major barrier to obtaining dental care is cost, not fear of visiting the dentist or even chronic dental pain. Expansion of Medicare Part B to include dental benefits would go a long way toward ensuring that the 60 million seniors and people with disabilities are able to obtain the care they need."
