    "body": "Alumni have a strong weapon to use to stand up for freedom of speech on campus (“Alumni Unite for Freedom of Speech” by Stuart Taylor Jr. and Edward Yingling, op-ed, Oct. 18) and against intolerance of different viewpoints: the withholding of money. This can include refusing to watch or attend any sporting events involving your alma mater (or perhaps any other university as well), refusing to purchase anything from the school, including any item, such as a sweatshirt, that is official merchandise, and, of course, refusing to donate to the alumni association.<br />If enough people make it clear to their alma maters why they are practicing an economic boycott, I predict positive results can and will be achieved."
