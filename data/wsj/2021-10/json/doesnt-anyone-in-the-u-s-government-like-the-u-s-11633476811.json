    "body": "“Woke” seems like too nice a term for people who casually toss around vicious smears against the United States. Particularly galling is when rhetorical attacks on U.S. liberty come from tax-consuming officials at the most dubious arms of the federal government. Did the Federal Reserve recently publish one such attack?<br />The Fed’s recent tolerance of inflation in our nation’s currency is disturbing enough. But however misguided the Fed’s monetary policies and bank supervision may be, one hopes that Fed officials are at least attempting to preserve our nation and the vibrant free economy that made the U.S. the most prosperous nation on earth."
