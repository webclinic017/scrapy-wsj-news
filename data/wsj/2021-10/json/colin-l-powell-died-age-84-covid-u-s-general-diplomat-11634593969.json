    "body": "Few men in American history came from more modest means and rose to more dramatic military and diplomatic heights than Colin L. Powell, who died Monday at age 84. His family said he died of complications from Covid-19, which still kills too many Americans too soon. But Powell’s extraordinary life is what the country should remember and celebrate.<br />Born in Harlem to immigrants from Jamaica, Powell went to City College when that institution had high standards and was still a path to upward mobility. He enrolled in the Army’s Reserve Officer Training Corps, which launched him on a distinguished military career. His service included combat tours in Vietnam, two Purple Hearts, and the Soldier’s Medal for returning to a crashed helicopter to rescue fellow soldiers."
