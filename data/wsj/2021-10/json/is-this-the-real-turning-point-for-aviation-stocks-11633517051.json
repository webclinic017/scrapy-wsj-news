    "body": "Investors who bought aviation stocks to ride the pandemic recovery have learned the hard way that this is a turbulent trip. Things could get smoother, but it is worth shelling out for a first-class ticket.<br />Airline stocks have gained more than 10% over the past month, as broader equity markets tumbled. However, this is merely a partial rebound from a bad summer for aviation shares, including those of plane makers. Only budget-airline stocks currently trade above their pre-Covid levels."
