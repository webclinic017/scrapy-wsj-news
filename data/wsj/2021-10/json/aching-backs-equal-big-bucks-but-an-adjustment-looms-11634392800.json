    "body": "When the boss of a public company tells his investors that “pain isn’t going away,” it is usually a bad sign. Not in this case.<br />The Joint Corp  seems to have cracked the formula for chiropractic treatment. Using convenient storefronts and upfront prices that bypass insurance, the rapidly expanding chain has drawn flocks of customers with sore backs. Systemwide gross sales have grown at a blistering compound annual pace of 70% a year since 2012 compared with barely 5% for the overall U.S. market for the controversial treatments, which is worth about $18 billion a year."
