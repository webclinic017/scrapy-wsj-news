    "body": "Josh Gottheimer was certain the House would vote Thursday to pass the Senate public-works bill, as Speaker Nancy Pelosi had promised. How certain? “1,000 percent,” the New Jersey Congressman told CNN.<br />By the end of Thursday, with no vote looming, Mr. Gottheimer was still confident that a vote Friday would save the day. “It ain’t over yet!” he tweeted. “This is just one long legislative day—we literally aren’t adjourning. Negotiations are still ongoing, and we’re continuing to work. As I said earlier: grabbing some Gatorade and Red Bull.”"
