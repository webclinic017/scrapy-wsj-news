    "body": "A Haitian gang kidnapped a group of American missionaries on Oct. 16 and is holding them for ransom. The group of 16 Americans and one Canadian includes seven women and five children, and belongs to Ohio-based Christian Aid Ministries, a charity set up by Amish and Mennonites. Haitian authorities believe the abduction was carried out by a gang that calls itself the 400 Mawozo.<br />The missionaries were ambushed on a road east of the capital Port-au-Prince on Saturday after visiting a nearby orphanage. They were traveling in a minibus through the Croix-des-Bouquets suburb when armed men forced their vehicle off the road and abducted them, Haitian officials say. Haiti’s Justice Minister Liszt Quitel said the group is being held for ransom and that the FBI was assisting Haitian authorities. He said he didn’t know how much money the kidnappers were asking to free the American missionaries, but said the gang in the past had asked as much as $8 million for a kidnapped priest."
