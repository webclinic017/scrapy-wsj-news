    "body": "U.S. home sales surged in September with their strongest showing since January, ending a monthslong stretch when housing market activity slowed from its frenzied pace and high prices crowded out many buyers.<br />A late-summer dip in mortgage rates and the continued hunt for more space to work at home spurred an uptick in demand, housing analysts said. Sales were especially robust at the high end, aided by a booming stock market."
