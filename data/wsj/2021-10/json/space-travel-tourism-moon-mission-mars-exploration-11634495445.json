    "body": "Space tourism has arrived, coming into its own with the launch, orbit and safe return of civilians to Earth on SpaceX’s Inspiration4 mission in September. Watching that mission was gratifying. It was American ingenuity at its finest and showed that space missions have evolved from a public enterprise to a private one. But it also reinforced the urgency of reasserting broader American leadership in space.<br />Nearly 25 years ago, when I testified before Congress on space-related developments—and delays—my primary concern was that we were failing to approach the future with the same energy, ambition, vision and execution that characterized our moon missions. Areas of particular concern included American leadership in near-Earth orbit, heavy launch, reusability, public-private partnerships, international cooperation, pioneering civilian space tourism and getting back to the moon and on to Mars."
