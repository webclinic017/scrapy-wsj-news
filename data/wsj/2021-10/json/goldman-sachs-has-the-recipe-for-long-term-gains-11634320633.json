    "body": "As the autumnal poem goes, nothing gold can stay. Except maybe  Goldman Sachs  shares.<br />While big commercial banks have been getting huge earnings uplifts from releases of loan-loss reserves, that is not as much the case for Goldman Sachs, which isn’t a lender to the same degree. Instead, what is extraordinary for Goldman right now is just how much money it is making in Wall Street businesses such as merger-and-acquisition advising, a bigger contributor for the bank than many peers. Revenues in financial advisory more than tripled in the third quarter from a year ago. Over the first three quarters of the year, they doubled from a year earlier."
