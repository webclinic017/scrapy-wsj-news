    "body": "As a child growing up in the 1930s, Vin Scully would take a glass of milk, a plate of crackers and a pillow into the living room of his family’s walk-up apartment in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. He would crawl underneath a massive four-legged radio console, put his head down and let the sound of a baseball game wash over him, like water rushing out from a shower head.<br />“When I got old enough to really express myself, I knew that it was the radio that really brought me into yearning to do baseball,” Mr. Scully said. “The simple radio and baseball, that was my springboard.”"
