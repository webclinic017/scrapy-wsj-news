    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House was set to vote Tuesday for legislation raising the U.S. borrowing limit into December, temporarily staving off a default while lawmakers battle over setting a new ceiling for U.S. debt.<br />House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif) called the House back from a week away from Washington to pass a debt-ceiling increase that cleared the Senate last week. The hasty return followed a warning from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to House Democratic leaders that if the chamber failed to act this week, the U.S. would be unable to pay its bills. The White House has said that President Biden will sign the measure into law."
