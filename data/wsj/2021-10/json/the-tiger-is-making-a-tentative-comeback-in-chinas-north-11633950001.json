By 1998, decades of economic expansion, poaching and human encroachment had reduced the population to just seven known individuals—leaving them functionally extinct in a country that has long revered the large cats.<br />What has happened since, however, is a rare success story in the world of conservation. Over the past two decades, as tigers have been wiped out in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and southern China, the number in northeastern China, the last corner of the country where the wild felines still roam, has climbed to as many as 55. That is a “dramatic recovery,” according to a recent study by Chinese scientists, the World Wildlife Fund and the Wildlife Conservation Society."
