    "body": "Evergrande, the heavily indebted Chinese property developer spooking global markets, appears to be running out of money and customers. Nonetheless it surprised creditors by paying off $83.5 million of interest on a dollar bond last Thursday. Meanwhile it needs to make another $45 million payment by this Friday, and its dollar bonds are still trading at around 20 cents on the dollar, implying a very high probability of default or deep haircuts.<br />What are investors to make of all of this? If the company is going to default eventually, why make payments now? Especially given that Evergrande is also on the hook to deliver so many unbuilt apartments to Chinese families who are presumably Beijing’s priority?"
