    "body": "Education reform advocates have proposed a ballot initiative in California that could allow them to use the courts to challenge teacher-tenure laws and other policies they believe are harming public school students.<br />Similar ballot measures were proposed last year in Minnesota and earlier this year in New Mexico. As with the California proposal, they would put childrenâ€™s right to a quality public education in state constitutions."
