    "body": "The opinion poll seems now to be at the center of contemporary American political life. So endemic is polling that it feels as if what a politician does is less important than whether the public approves or disapproves. Polls are a great mainstay of television news, filling in five or so minutes on an otherwise dull day. They are especially valuable to the standard politician, whose primary question is how to get re-elected. Approval or disapproval of his actions in polls may provide crucial clues.<br />Polls have been around for more than a century, though they only gained authority in the 1940s with the scientific pretensions of the polling procedures of George Gallup and the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at Cornell University. For years the accuracy of polling was challenged. Doubtless the greatest failure of the pollsters came with their confident assurance that Thomas Dewey and not Harry Truman would be elected president in 1948. Today critics continue to question some of the methods of the pollsters: their choice of population samples, their neutrality, sometimes the inanity of their questions."
