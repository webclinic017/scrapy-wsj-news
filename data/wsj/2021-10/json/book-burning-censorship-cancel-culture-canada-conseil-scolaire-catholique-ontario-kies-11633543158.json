    "body": "Mention book burning and people think of Nazi Germany, or maybe Anthony Comstock. Yet the practice has made a comeback recently, in Canada of all places.<br />Conseil scolaire catholique Providence, a French-language school board for southwestern Ontario, launched an “educational program” in 2019 called Giving Back to Mother Earth. The goal was to replace library books “that had outdated content and carried negative stereotypes about First Nations, Métis and Inuit people.” Radio-Canada, the French-language public broadcaster, broke the story last month."
