    "body": "In “The Government Family Plan” (Sept. 21), the editorial board cites a survey that found two-thirds of workers who took family or medical leave over the previous two years received some pay. Often, that’s only for a small period of time—and what about the one-third of workers who received no pay at all? We need to ensure all Americans have a safety net that provides paid leave so they can recover from illness or injury, bond with a new child or care for a sick loved one.<br />The editorial suggests that employers will steer clear of private paid leave if they have the public option. This is not the case. The Ways and Means Committee’s proposal creates a private-public partnership that provides basic coverage to everyone and gives employers the choice to leverage the government program or build a private plan, based on their needs and ability to do more. We see many of our clients choosing to offer richer benefits, even when a state paid leave program is in place. In the war for talent, robust benefits are a key tool in recruitment and retention."
