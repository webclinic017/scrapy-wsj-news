    "body": "The global auto industry is investing billions of dollars in chips made of silicon carbide, a more robust cousin of Silicon Valley’s namesake element that companies believe can help them build high-performance electric vehicles.<br />Silicon carbide, or SiC, is silicon married to carbon, the material in a diamond. Using it in chips that control power—as  Tesla Inc.  has done for several years—means less energy gets lost, which in turn leads to a more powerful motor that can drive farther on a single charge."
