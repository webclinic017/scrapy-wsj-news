    "body": "One evening while watching Netflix with her husband, Nicole Katsulis worked up her nerve and asked him something terrifying:  “Why don’t you want to have sex with me?”<br />Ms. Katsulis, a teacher, knew her body had changed during the pandemic.

Countless nights snuggled with her family in front of the TV bingeing on chips and cookies had also taken their toll. Now, she worried that she no longer turned her husband on."
