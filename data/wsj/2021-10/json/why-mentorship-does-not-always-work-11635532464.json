    "body": "Companies have a problem when they make workplace mentorship programs optional: The workers who would benefit most are less likely to sign up.<br />That is the conclusion of a study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. “Where we might think that those who are likely to benefit the most from mentoring are going to raise their hands and choose to participate, we find that it is actually the opposite,” says Jason Sandvik, assistant professor at the Freeman School of Business at Tulane University, and one of the study’s four co-authors. “Those who are likely to benefit the most from mentorship are those who opted out.”"
