    "body": "IT’S BEEN A banner year and a half for astronomy buffs. Backyard hobbyists, housebound for much of the pandemic, drove sales of home telescopes, according to David Nagler, president of Tele Vue Optics in Chester, N.Y., which specializes in astronomical instruments. “There isn’t a week that doesn’t contain several phone calls from customers who either bought their first telescope or had a latent interest in amateur astronomy but never got around to pursuing it,” said Mr. Nagler. And then this July, the Shanghai Astronomy Museum—the world’s largest—opened and the Chankillo Astronomical Complex, a prehistoric observatory in Peru’s Casma Valley, was added to the Unesco World Heritage List.<br />While Peru reopened its borders to tourists in March, China remains off-limits to most visitors for now, but astronomy fans are typically a patient bunch. If you can’t wait to indulge your stargazing passion, we’ve rounded up a few places stateside to satiate pros and rookies alike."
