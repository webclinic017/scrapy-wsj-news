    "body": "On Monday Mitch McConnell sent President Biden a letter insisting, as he has for months, that Democrats bear sole responsibility for raising the nation’s debt limit. The president responded by calling Mr. McConnell’s position “reckless” and “irresponsible.”<br />Although Mr. McConnell’s tactics are patently partisan, Mr. Biden and Chuck Schumer must face facts: They do not have the power to make him change course. If Democrats don’t discharge the responsibility Mr. McConnell has thrust upon them, the country faces an economic crisis."
