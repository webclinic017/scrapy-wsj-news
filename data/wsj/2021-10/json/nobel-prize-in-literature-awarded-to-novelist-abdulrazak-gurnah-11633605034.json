    "body": "Abdulrazak Gurnah won the Nobel Prize in Literature for what the judges described as his uncompromising and compassionate presentation of the effects of colonialism and the fate of refugees.<br />Mr. Gurnah was born in 1948 and grew up on the island of Zanzibar, now part of Tanzania. He arrived in the U.K. as a refugee at the end of the 1960s. Until his recent retirement, he was professor of English and postcolonial literatures at the University of Kent, Canterbury."
