    "body": "Democrats walked into a political ditch with their plan to let the Internal Revenue Service snoop on American banks accounts, and so far they’re doing a lousy job of scrambling to get out.<br />This week Senate Democrats backed by the Biden Treasury released a revised proposal that raises the threshold for financial institutions to report to the IRS on individual accounts to $10,000 from the previously mooted $600. The proposal also tries to dodge the charge of snooping on Everyman by exempting wage income from “certain payroll companies” and Social Security checks."
