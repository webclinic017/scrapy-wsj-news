    "body": "WASHINGTON—Attorney General Merrick Garland signaled he has no plans to withdraw a memo ordering the FBI to help local leaders address threats against educators, as Republicans stepped up their criticism of it as a heavy-handed effort to silence parents who speak out on topics like mask mandates and how race is addressed in schools.<br />Mr. Garland on Wednesday stood behind the Oct. 4 directive during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, his second appearance before Congress in less than a week in which Republicans made it the focus of their questioning."
