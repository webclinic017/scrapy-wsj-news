    "body": "Chinese equities’ terrible, no good, very bad year has been a boost to India. But with energy prices rising and India’s market already very richly valued, buying in now might be a mistake.<br />The country’s red-hot stock market contrasts sharply with its languishing Chinese counterpart. Regulatory concerns and a property market slowdown have punished the MSCI China in 2021—the index is down 11%. That compares with a 30% gain for MSCI India. The Indian market has probably benefited from investors fleeing Chinese and Hong Kong stocks for a big Asian emerging market that still offers strong growth potential. Indeed, according to Goldman Sachs, India is one of the most overweighted markets for funds invested in emerging markets. Allocations to India for Asia-focused funds are 4.1 percentage points higher than India’s weight in the benchmark MSCI Asia ex-Japan."
