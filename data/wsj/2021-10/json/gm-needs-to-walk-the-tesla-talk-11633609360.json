    "body": "GM painted a wildly ambitious picture of growth at its much-anticipated 2021 investor conference. What investors really need from the company, though, isn’t more talk.<br />On Wednesday afternoon, the Detroit automotive giant kicked off its first big strategy event since the start of the pandemic by promising to double revenue and raise margins by 2030. These targets form the core of Chief Executive Mary Barra’s boldest bid yet to position GM as a growth-focused technology company rather than a mere manufacturer of light vehicles. As cars become the ultimate mobile devices, she wants to be the  Apple  of the automotive industry, a “platform innovator” with more than $80 billion in revenue from “new businesses” at the end of the decade."
