    "body": "The United Auto Workers union is notoriously corrupt, but is there a glimmer of reform hope? Some one million active and retired union members began voting this week on a weeks-long referendum to directly elect their leaders.<br />Under the current process, local chapters select delegates, who in turn choose who serves on the UAWâ€™s governing international executive board. This has produced a network of cronies with little accountability to the broader membership. The referendum is part of a consent decree the federal government reached with the union this year after an investigation led to the criminal conviction of 11 senior UAW officials and others."
