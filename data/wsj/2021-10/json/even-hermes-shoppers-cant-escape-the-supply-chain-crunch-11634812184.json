    "body": "Birkin handbag maker Hermès reported another impressive set of results on Thursday. But it’s nothing compared with how the brand has performed in the secondhand market recently.<br />The Paris-listed luxury goods company is coming out of the Covid-19 crisis as a much bigger business. Sales over the three months through September increased by 40% compared with the same period of pre-pandemic 2019. Demand is especially strong in China and in the U.S., where the brand recently opened a new store in Florida."
