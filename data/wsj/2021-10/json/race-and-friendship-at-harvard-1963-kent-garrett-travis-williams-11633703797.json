    "body": "The book is called “The Last Negroes at Harvard: The Class of 1963 and the 18 Young Men Who Changed Harvard Forever.”<br />Its author, Kent Garrett, born in Brooklyn’s Fort Greene projects, was one of those 18 young men. So was my friend Travis Williams. Kent called them “the last Negroes at Harvard” because presently the term “Negro” would be retired in favor of “black” and later “African-American.” I, too, was a member of the class of ’63. I am white."
