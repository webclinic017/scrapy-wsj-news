    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to quickly consider two lawsuits challenging a Texas ban on most abortions but left the restrictive law in place for now, adding a new blockbuster battle to a docket that already included another major abortion-rights case.<br />The court set oral arguments for Nov. 1 but deferred acting on an emergency request from the Justice Department to block the Texas law while the federal government challenges its legality. The Texas limits, which are the most restrictive in the U.S., have been in effect for nearly two months."
