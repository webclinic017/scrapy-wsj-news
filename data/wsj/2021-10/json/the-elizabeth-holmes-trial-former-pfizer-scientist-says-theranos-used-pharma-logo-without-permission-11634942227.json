    "body": "SAN JOSE, Calif.— A former scientist for  Pfizer Inc.  testified in federal court Friday that he had advised his employer against working with Theranos Inc. more than a year before the startup altered a report so it featured Pfizer’s logo and purported to validate Theranos’s blood-testing devices.<br />The testimony by Shane Weber in the criminal fraud trial of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes directly supports claims by government prosecutors that Ms. Holmes had forged the document to show it to investors and persuade them that Theranos had been checked out and approved by Pfizer."
