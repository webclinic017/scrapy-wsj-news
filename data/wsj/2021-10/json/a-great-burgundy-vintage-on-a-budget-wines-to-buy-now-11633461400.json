    "body": "EXTREME WEATHER happens so frequently these days that when a vintage is described as “dramatic,” it almost seems commonplace. Happily, in the case of the 2019 Burgundy vintage, the word “dramatic” is coupled to the word “great.”<br />The weather in Burgundy that year ranged from frost to rain to intense sun and extended dry periods. But all was well in the end. Indeed, the Bourgogne Wine Board used the word “magic” to describe 2019—though the same press release noted that the growers were stressed and tense. That struggle made the 12 bottles of 2019 Bourgogne Blanc I purchased to taste seem that much more impressive."
