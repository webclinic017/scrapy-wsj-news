    "body": "William Shatner of “Star Trek” fame didn’t see any Klingons or Romulans during his recent trip to outer space, but he’s now firing a few photon torpedoes at another enemy of the whole enterprise. This week Britain’s Prince William, without mentioning any names, told a BBC interviewer: “We need some of the world’s greatest brains and minds fixed on trying to repair this planet, not trying to find the next place to go and live.”<br />The BBC journalist then mused about the carbon footprint presumably created by a rocket flight for leisure, which Prince William agreed was a “fundamental question.” What rubbish, as the Brits say."
