    "body": "Your editorial “Colin L. Powell” (Oct. 19), noted how he attended City College, part of the City University of New York (CUNY). Unfortunately, you claimed that Powell attended City College “when that institution had high standards and was still a path to upward mobility.”<br />Just as City College did for Powell in the 1950s, CUNY continues to transform the lives of students in the 21st century. City College was singled out this past month by the annual Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education College Rankings for being the top “Best Value” college in the nation. This is the second year in a row that City College—as well as several other CUNY institutions—were cited by these rankings for the singular quality, affordability and diversity they offer students."
