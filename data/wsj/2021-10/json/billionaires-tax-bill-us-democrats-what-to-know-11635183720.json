    "body": "WASHINGTON—Democrats are considering a new tax on billionaires to help pay for President Biden’s agenda.<br />The tax would help raise money to pay for spending proposals, including expanded child tax credit and climate-change policies. While Mr. Biden didn’t support the idea during the 2020 campaign, he turned to it after a different capital-gains tax change failed to get enough support among some congressional Democrats and after Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) objected to other tax-rate increases."
