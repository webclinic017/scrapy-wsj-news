    "body": "Saudi Arabia is pushing fellow oil producers to present a united front at climate talks that start this month and oppose rising calls for a reduction in fossil-fuel investment, say people familiar with the strategy, arguing that such a move could further push up energy prices.<br />The kingdom, along with key oil-producing allies, including the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, is arguing publicly and privately that any calls for lower investment in new oil and natural gas development endorsed at a United Nations climate summit that kicks off on Oct. 31 in Glasgow, Scotland, could lead to higher prices and widen the gap between rich and poor countries."
