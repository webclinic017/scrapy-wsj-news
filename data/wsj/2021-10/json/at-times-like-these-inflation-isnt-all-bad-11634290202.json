    "body": "The jump in inflation that the Covid crisis has brought on might not be as transitory as many have hoped. But for the economy to smoothly adjust to a post-pandemic future, higher prices could be necessary.<br />Covid-related shortages have driven prices for all kinds of things sharply higher, something more than evident in last Wednesday’s inflation report from the Labor Department, much less a trip to the store. The global semiconductor shortage has slowed production of cars, for example, and new vehicle prices last month were up 8.7% from a year earlier, the inflation report showed. Supply-chain snarls have helped push prices for furniture 11.2% higher."
