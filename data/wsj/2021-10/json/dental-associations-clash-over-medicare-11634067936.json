    "body": "It is essential to provide some perspective regarding “Dentists’ Group Fights Medicare Coverage” (U.S. News, Sept. 28), concerning the American Dental Association. The National Dental Association (NDA) is advocating for a Medicare dental benefit. Members of the NDA have accepted Medicaid patients at a rate of over 60% participation since the implementation of Medicaid in the 1960s, and we believe that our position gains credibility from our experience in the delivery of care to underserved populations.<br />We do not believe that there should be a needs test or co-payments for those who have paid into the Medicare program for their healthcare. Oral healthcare is a part of healthcare and can lead to significant cost savings. A study by the Dental Trade Alliance found that treating gum disease led to medical cost savings of $5,681 a year, with hospitalizations reduced by 39%. Diabetics receiving care saved $39 billion in medical costs annually. That doesn’t include the cost savings from a reduction in emergency-room services. Those savings could be used to provide dental services without needs testing or co-payments."
