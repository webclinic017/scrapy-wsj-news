    "body": "Reading, the Swiss writer Ludwig Hohl tells us, is like entering “a dark room, leaving behind the previous tolerable level of light: semi-darkness.” You notice how “here and there, a piece of jewelry flashes, a candle glows.” Through a window, you look out onto “a world (none other than the old world, your own mundane world) so layered, so painted, so much richer than all you had known,” yet at the same time gently blurred. A great book lets us see differently, even if we don’t know exactly how.<br />The first draft of Hohl’s magnum opus, “The Notes, or On Non-premature Reconciliation,” was itself written in a dark basement room in The Hague, over three years of “extreme spiritual desolation.” When, after more than a decade of peripatetic self-exile, the autodidact author returned to his native Switzerland, in 1937, he carried with him a “four and a half kilo primeval forest of variations and attempts” at concise, precise, “firm” literary expression. Then 33, he spent much of his remaining four decades in another basement, in Geneva, arranging and rearranging the pages on the clotheslines that crisscrossed his room."
