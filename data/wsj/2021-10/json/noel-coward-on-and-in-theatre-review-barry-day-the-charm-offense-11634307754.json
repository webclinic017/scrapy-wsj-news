    "body": "The young Noël Coward was often disparaged as a boy who was clever and knew it. You have to admire his response: “How do they think I could be clever and not know it?” The logic and tone are distinctively Coward’s. Here was confidence and reasonableness and a nimble wit able to render ambition and even arrogance appealing. And, obviously, a dramatic flair for turnabout.<br />By the time the shy and gangly Noël reached his teens, he was a veteran of the English stage. He’d turned pro—begun drawing a salary—at the age of 10, performing in a fairy play. Noël was born in 1899 into a middle-class family of exaggerated ancestral glory (manorial estates and family crests floated dimly in the golden background), and the theater provided him with something more than an escape—a princely, if wobbly, palace of powder and paint. He made it his own. Eventually, he made an even larger domain his own: He became a dispensary of words through a host of written and spoken media. There can’t be another English artist, rooted in theater, whose career exhibited mastery of such scope: He was playwright and actor, screenwriter and film director, songwriter and singer and cabaret artist, poet and fiction writer and autobiographer—the list goes on."
