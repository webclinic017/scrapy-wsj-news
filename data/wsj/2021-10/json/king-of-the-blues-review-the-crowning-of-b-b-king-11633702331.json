    "body": "B.B. King, dead six years, just grabbed an exclamation point-studded headline on TMZ. Not exactly noted for guitar geekdom, the site reveled in the news that King had not fathered the 15 children he claimed as his own and supported.<br />The suggestion that King was sterile due to an accident at age 12 and a brutal STD treatment in young adulthood is grabbed from Daniel de Visé’s new cradle-to-grave and beyond biography. But “King of the Blues” is mostly not that kind of book—in fact, it’s quite a fluent read of a major artist’s evolution, along with a good bit of context that the scandal-skimmers won’t print. Mr. de Visé has dived deeply into the world of an American master and discovered that the guitar god was mortal after all—in certain respects anyway."
