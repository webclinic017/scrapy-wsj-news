    "body": "I’d always assumed I’d be a father, for better or worse, until the day I assumed I never would. My wife and I married at 25, expecting, like good Catholics, that our own children would simply arrive. But they didn’t.<br />For the first two years after we were married I didn’t really notice. I felt I had been dealt an extended honeymoon. In the third year I started to wonder, and then my wife and I spent the next five years asking questions: first of each other (are we doing this right?); then of doctors (well, are we?); and finally of God."
