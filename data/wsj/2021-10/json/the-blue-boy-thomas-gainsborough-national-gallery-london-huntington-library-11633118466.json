    "body": "From the moment “The Blue Boy” made its debut at London’s Royal Academy in 1770, it has always been a sensation. Scholars and critics have called it “the world’s most beautiful picture” and deemed it the career “apogee” of Thomas Gainsborough, one of England’s greatest 18th-century painters. When the painting went on view in January 1922, after the Duke of Westminster sold it to art dealer Joseph Duveen, who resold it to the American Henry E. Huntington, “great crowds almost stormed” the National Gallery in London for a last look, according to contemporary accounts; some 90,000 people visited it during its three-week exhibition there.<br />Next Jan. 25, exactly 100 years later, “The Blue Boy” will again be shown at the National Gallery, on loan (until May 15, 2022) for the first time ever from the Huntington Library, Art Museum and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, Calif., which the railroad and real-estate magnate created as a public institution in 1919. Many people go there only to see “The Blue Boy,” which hangs in a place of honor in a large gallery devoted to British Grand Manner portraits."
