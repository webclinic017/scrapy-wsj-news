    "body": "Volvo Cars, the Swedish auto maker owned by China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding, said Monday it would proceed with an initial public offering in Stockholm, in a deal that people familiar with the matter say could value it at upward of $25 billion.<br />Volvo said it aims to raise about 25 billion kronor, equivalent to $2.86 billion, from the issue of new shares. Geely will also sell an unspecified number of its shares as well, according to marketing material. Volvo didn’t provide a target valuation of the entire company following the IPO, or say what percentage stake Geely would retain."
