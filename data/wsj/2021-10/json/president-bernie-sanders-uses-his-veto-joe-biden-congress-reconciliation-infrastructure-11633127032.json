    "body": "As we recall, President Biden defeated Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Democratic primaries, but lately it’s hard to tell. The Vermont socialist is issuing his own veto over Mr. Biden’s agenda on Capitol Hill until he gets the new entitlements and tax increases he wants.<br />Mr. Biden, who desperately needs a political victory—any victory—had been hoping the House would pass the $1 trillion Senate infrastructure bill on Thursday as Speaker Nancy Pelosi predicted. When was the last time Democrats turned away $1 trillion in spending, especially when it comes gift-wrapped in 19 Senate GOP votes? Our guess is never."
