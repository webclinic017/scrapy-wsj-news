    "body": "President Joe Biden’s weak standing in public opinion polls is so dangerous for incumbent Democrats that party colleagues up for reelection in 2022 may soon be chanting, “Let’s go, Brandon!”<br />Part of Mr. Biden’s problem is that much of his agenda is disconnected from the current challenges facing the country.
