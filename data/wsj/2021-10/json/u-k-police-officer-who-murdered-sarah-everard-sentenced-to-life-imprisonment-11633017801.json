    "body": "The London Metropolitan Police officer who murdered Sarah Everard has been sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison, in a case that sparked alarm in the U.K. over women’s safety and the trustworthiness of the police.<br />Wayne Couzens, 48, abducted the 33-year-old marketing executive under the guise of enforcing Covid-19 restrictions as she walked home from a friend’s house in south London in March. England was in lockdown at the time, and London’s Central Criminal Court heard how Mr. Couzens stopped Ms. Everard and showed his police identification before handcuffing her and pulling her toward a rented car."
