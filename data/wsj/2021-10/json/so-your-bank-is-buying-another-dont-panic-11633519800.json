    "body": "There’s an urge to merge among U.S. banks right now. Investors might not need to run for cover.<br />It is usually pretty pleasant for a bank stock you own to be acquired, but often not as nice to own the one doing the acquiring. There is typically agreement that size and scale are beneficial. One potential investor concern is that a merger might be driven in part by executive compensation since bigger bank bosses tend to be paid more, notes Autonomous Research analyst Brian Foran. It can also be tough to independently measure whether cost-savings projections actually materialize partly because conditions for banks, such as interest rates or the direction of markets, are constantly in flux. As for the stocks: A recent McKinsey & Co. study found that among 58 midcap bank mergers from 2010 to 2021, only 17 merged institutions’ returns outperformed peers over the two years postdeal."
