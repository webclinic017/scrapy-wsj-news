    "body": "A painting that British street artist Banksy purposely shredded during a previous auction sold Thursday to an anonymous Asian collector for $25.4 million at Sotheby’s in London, setting a new record for the artist at auction.<br />Banksy famously pranked the art world three years ago when he hid a remote-controlled paper shredder in the gilt frame of one of his paintings so it could self-destruct right after Sotheby’s London auctioned it off."
