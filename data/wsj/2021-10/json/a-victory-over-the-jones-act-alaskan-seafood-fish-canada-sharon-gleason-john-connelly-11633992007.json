    "body": "Millions of pounds of Alaskan seafood have been trapped in a legal limbo in Canada for weeks, but on Sunday a federal judge said the fish-filet supply chain can get moving again. That’s good news for jobs and American consumers, so feel free to bust out the tartar sauce, even if the court fight isn’t finished.<br />The dispute is over the 1920 Jones Act, which says that domestic waterborne cargo must be carried by ships built in the U.S. and manned by Americans. The law has an exception if the route involves Canadian rail. How much rail qualifies? Since 2012, Alaskan seafood has been shipped to Bayside, a Canadian port north of Maine, where it has been given a fast ride on 100 feet of rail track."
