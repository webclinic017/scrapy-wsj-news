    "body": "As a volunteer physician in Haiti during the early 1980s, I witnessed another of Anthony Fauci’s unsubstantiated epidemiological proclamations besides promulgating the high risk of a heterosexual AIDS epidemic in America (“Unlearned AIDS Lessons for Covid” by John Tierney, op-ed, Oct. 4). In his senior government role, he unfairly stigmatized Haitians as a disease vector for AIDS. This decimated Haiti’s tourist industry, which has not recovered to this day. Haitians in the U.S. were subject to brutal discrimination, especially when trying to find work or rent apartments.<br />To me and my Haitian physician colleagues, the source of AIDS in Haiti was obvious—American sex tourists. In fact, virtually every dying AIDS patient I cared for was a prostitute who had catered to Americans. As a physician, Dr. Fauci certainly knew that Haitians had no genetic predilection to AIDS."
