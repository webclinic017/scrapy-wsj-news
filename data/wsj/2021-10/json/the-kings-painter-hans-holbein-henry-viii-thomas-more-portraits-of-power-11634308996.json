    "body": "We trust that political art is always bad art, but Hans Holbein the Younger, one of the first masters of the modern character study, was a political artist to the tip of his brush. He was also, as Franny Moyle shows in this intricate and enlightening study of Holbein and his age, a religious artist about whom we know very little.<br />Contemporary sources, Ms. Moyle admits, are “sparse, to say the least.” Holbein was present at the court of Henry VIII and the creation of modern England. His absence from the records has formed an invitingly blank canvas for novelists, including Ford Madox Ford and Hilary Mantel, but created a challenge for historians. Ms. Moyle makes ingenious use of the literary equivalent of chiaroscuro, shadowing in what we know of the times so that the outline of the life shines brightly; as well as of sfumato, the “smoky,” allusive blurring of details that made Renaissance paintings shimmer with significance."
