    "body": "‘The Arabs never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity,” the Israeli diplomat Abba Eban observed in 1973. As the unfolding Biden fiasco looks set to present Republicans with an unusually promising political moment, will the same prove true of America’s conservative movement?<br />It’s easy to understand Republican complacency. Why not sit back and enjoy the spectacle of Democratic ineptitude and ideological overreach and wait to receive its fruits? On current polling evidence, the GOP is well-placed to win back control next year at least of the House and perhaps the Senate too, setting itself up for a good shot at the White House in 2024. In the face of your opponents’ implosion, masterful inaction is usually the order of the day: Don’t just do something, stand there."
