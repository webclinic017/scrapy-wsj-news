    "body": "In November 1975, Truman Capote published “La Côte Basque, 1965,” a chapter from a novel he was writing called “Answered Prayers.” The book, acquired by Random House nine years earlier, was to be Capote’s magnum opus, as he put it, an intimate exposé of midcentury New York society that would place him alongside Marcel Proust and Edith Wharton. After the success of “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” (1958) and his masterpiece, “In Cold Blood” (1966), Capote had shown himself to be a virtuoso in both fiction and nonfiction. His eagerly awaited new work would be a combination of the two. The book was so long in coming, however, that people began to wonder if the 51-year-old author was writing it at all.<br />When “La Côte Basque, 1965” appeared in Esquire magazine it proved to be thinly fictionalized, salacious gossip about the small circle of rich society women who were Capote’s friends. He’d been warned that they’d recognize themselves. “Naaaah, they’re too dumb,” Capote said. “They won’t know who they are.” He could not have been more wrong."
