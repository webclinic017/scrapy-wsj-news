    "body": "Reckitt Benckiser Group  PLC said demand for its cold and the flu products was picking up as social distancing eases, helping the owner of Mucinex medicine report stronger quarterly sales and raise its guidance for the year.<br />The U.K.-based consumer-goods giant said Tuesday that it had seen a “sharp improvement in cold and flu sales trends” in the third quarter. The resurgence comes after demand for Reckitt’s cold and flu medicines like Mucinex and Strepsils was hit last year as Covid-19 restrictions closed schools and offices, suppressing seasonal illness."
