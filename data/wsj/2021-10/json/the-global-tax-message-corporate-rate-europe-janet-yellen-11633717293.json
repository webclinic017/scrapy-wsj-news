    "body": "The high-tax lobby achieved—they think—their devoutly wished-for deal Friday when officials from 136 countries settled on new rules for taxing global corporations. Attention now shifts to national governments that are responsible for implementing this agreement, and the U.S. Congress especially should understand what it’s getting dragged into.<br />The contours of the deal follow earlier versions hashed out this year by Group of Seven finance ministers and then by roughly 130 governments via the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The plan consists of two pillars. The first is a major overhaul to century-old rules for taxing large companies, aimed especially at tech firms. The second is a new global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, which is supposed to limit tax-policy competition among governments."
