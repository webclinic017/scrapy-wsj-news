    "body": "EARLY IN THE new movie “Halloween Kills,” Laurie Strobe—Jamie Lee Curtis’s now-iconic character—is in the back of a truck, on the way to the hospital, terrified, a stab wound in her abdomen, fresh from setting fire to a house with the masked monster Michael Myers inside of it. She sees a fire truck heading toward the conflagration and screams: “Let it burn!”<br />Ms. Curtis, 62, comes by terror naturally. It’s an expression she’s worn her entire life, she says. “Even when I was a toddler, I was always looking over my shoulder,” she admitted in a recent Zoom interview, holding up her phone to flash a black-and-white picture of herself as a child. “I’m always looking like I’m in trouble or someone’s angry at me or something is coming at me,” she said of the surviving record of those early years."
