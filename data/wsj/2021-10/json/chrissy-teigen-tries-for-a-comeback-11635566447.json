    "body": "Chrissy Teigen, who once proclaimed herself canceled, is back.<br />The former supermodel, who is married to musician John Legend, spent years building a brand as a cookbook author, television personality and wisecracking star on Twitter. But over the past year, in the wake of a social-media scandal, the Chrissy Teigen brand turned its volume way down. After months being as low-profile as a celebrity with millions of social media followers can be, Ms. Teigen is edging further into the spotlight with this week’s release of her new cookbook, “Cravings: All Together.”"
