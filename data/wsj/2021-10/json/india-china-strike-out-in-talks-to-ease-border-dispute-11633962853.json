    "body": "NEW DELHIâ€”The latest round of high-level military talks between India and China failed to reach a deal to defuse tensions along their disputed border, the two countries said Monday, as troop deployments in the region have reached their highest level in decades.<br />The talks held between Indian and Chinese army commanders on Sunday were the latest efforts by the nuclear-armed neighbors to cool a standoff at the border. A Himalayan melee in June 2020 left 20 Indian troops and four Chinese soldiers dead."
