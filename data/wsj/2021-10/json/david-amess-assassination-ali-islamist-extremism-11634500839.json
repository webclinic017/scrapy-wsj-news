    "body": "The murder on Friday of Member of Parliament David Amess as he met with constituents has shocked Britain, and it ought to concern other Western democracies too. It’s the first assassination of a British political figure by an apparent Islamist that we can recall, and it raises troubling questions about assimilation and democratic norms.<br />Amess, a 69-year-old Tory MP for Essex east of London, was among the most well-liked and respected backbenchers. His service extended to the Thatcher era and he had assisted refugees from the world’s many despotisms. He was attacked in a church during his regular Friday constituent meeting. He was killed, in other words, doing the normal open business of representative democracy."
