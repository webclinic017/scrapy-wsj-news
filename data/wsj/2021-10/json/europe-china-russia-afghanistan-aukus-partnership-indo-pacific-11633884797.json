    "body": "After the chaotic Afghanistan retreat and the announcement of the new U.S. defense relationship with Australia, many Europeans are questioning the Biden administration’s assertion that America is “back.” Since the summer, those who long for so-called European strategic autonomy—mostly muted since President Biden’s election—have resumed banging the drum for the European Union to decouple from the U.S.<br />It’s time for those Europeans to confront the new global reality: America is back, but the world has changed. There are still security threats in Europe, not least from Russia, but for Washington the priority is Beijing’s campaign of hegemony. It is the right priority. If America loses its dominance in the Indo-Pacific, it will trigger a shock wave in global power balances that will engulf Europe too. Against such odds the U.S. and Europe should be working together, not competing, in the Indo-Pacific region."
