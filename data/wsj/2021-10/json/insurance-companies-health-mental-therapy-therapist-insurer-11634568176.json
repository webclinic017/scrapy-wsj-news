    "body": "As a therapist of more than 35 years who accepts insurance, I’ve witnessed a great metamorphosis in the industry (“Why It’s So Hard to Find a Therapist Who Takes Insurance,” Personal Journal, Oct. 6). Insurers made it difficult in the early years, chronically requesting reports to justify treatment, coupled with low reimbursements. More time was spent on paperwork than seeing patients. When you have overhead to cover and can see only one patient an hour, unlike medical physicians, insurance doesn’t cut it. Having office space in my husband’s medical office, I was lucky to have no rent, and hence was able to do it.<br />But Congress passed legislation that requires mental-health coverage to be on par with medical coverage. I now find reimbursements to be respectable and reasonable by most but not all companies. I am glad to see that mental health is finally being treated as though it were as vital as medical health."
