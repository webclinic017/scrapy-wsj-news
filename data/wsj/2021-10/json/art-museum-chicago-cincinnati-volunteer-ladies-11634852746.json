    "body": "Regarding the Chicago Art Institute’s firing of its “mostly” white docents (“Indocency at the Art Institute of Chicago” by Faith Bottum, op-ed, Oct. 16) and the ensuing letters (Oct. 20): I write as a proud adult child of one of the founding members of the first class of docents at the Cincinnati Art Museum. My mother was blessed with a fine college education, a rewarding experience during World War II in the Waves (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service), and marriage and motherhood. She was a smart white woman married to a white entrepreneur in the 1950s, ’60’s and ’70s.<br />She and her lady friends worked, unpaid, their whole adult lives for the Cincinnati Art Museum, establishing the docent program, gift shop and book department, as well as fundraising and event planning. Cincinnati’s cultural center benefited for years from this group of women’s unpaid efforts. My mom went to the museum every Tuesday and Thursday as I grew up, and other days as meetings demanded. Over the years she served as committee secretary, treasurer and buyer. She was only one of so many. She didn’t go to a “job,” but we children knew she was important and served as the ultimate example of “giving back.”"
