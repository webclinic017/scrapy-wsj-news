    "body": "WASHINGTON—Lawmakers pressed forward with efforts to strike a deal enabling Medicare to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to lower drug costs, despite President Biden’s decision to leave the provision out of the framework for a $1.85 trillion social spending and climate package.<br />The omission of any provision allowing Medicare to negotiate for the price of drugs unleashed intense concern from a range of lawmakers on Thursday, who said discussions over the topic were continuing with the goal of including a proposal in the bill’s final text."
