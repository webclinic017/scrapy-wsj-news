    "body": "Garry Kasparov does an excellent job defending Christopher Columbus (“Celebrate Columbus’s Achievements,” op-ed, Oct. 11). The annual bashing of the 15th-century European discoverer of the New World always strikes me as absurd. What do today’s virtuous judges of history imagine as the alternative to the global exploration by Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Ferdinand Magellan, et al.? Do they really think there was a moment when everyone in Europe would say, “Oh, let’s just stay home and make the best of things where we are?” Mankind has always had its explorers, seeking new frontiers, crossing the oceans, going to the moon. Exploration and colonization of other lands could not have stopped at any prior point with Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great or Charlemagne.<br />What about all the good things that happened as a result of European colonization of the Americas? First and foremost, the evolution of the greatest, freest nation on earth, which went on to help others—liberating Europe from the Nazis, for example. There’s a reason so many people want to come here."
