    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden’s wide-ranging framework for social-spending legislation includes about $555 billion for climate-related provisions, a proposal that the White House said will help the U.S. meet its pledge to halve domestic greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the decade.<br />Democrats haven’t formally signed off on the framework, and lawmakers expect that it could change as they hammer out the details of the measure. It nonetheless gave Mr. Biden something to tout at the international climate summit in Glasgow that begins Sunday."
