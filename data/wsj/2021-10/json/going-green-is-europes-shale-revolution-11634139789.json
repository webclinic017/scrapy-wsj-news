    "body": "The shale revolution gave the U.S. energy independence. Europe wants the same thing from green energy—all the more so as natural-gas prices skyrocket.<br />Europe is in the midst of an energy crisis, with concerns about gas shortages if the winter is cold. On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putinrejected assertions that Moscow is weaponizing energy, blaming the current shortage partly on the diversion of U.S. liquefied natural gas to Asia, where prices are higher. Speaking at a conference in Moscow, he said Russia had increased gas supplies to Europe this year and could provide more, adding that quick approval of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline could help rebalance the market."
