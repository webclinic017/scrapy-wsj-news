    "body": "Social media is far from perfect, but it is a game—for better or for worse—that is won by comparison.<br />Facebook ’s  shares rose nearly 2% on Monday after the company said its total revenue growth in the third quarter fell by more than 20 percentage points on a sequential basis due to  Apple ’s  recent changes to its iOS system which limit user tracking. The company’s forecast for total revenue growth from a year earlier in the fourth quarter was also about 7 percentage points shy of analyst estimates at the midpoint of the guidance range."
