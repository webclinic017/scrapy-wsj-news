    "body": "SAN JOSE, Calif.—The former top executive for Safeway Inc. took the witness stand Wednesday in the criminal-fraud trial of Elizabeth Holmes to discuss years of promises by Ms. Holmes that led the grocery-store chain to invest more than $350 million into a partnership with her blood-testing company Theranos Inc. that never fully materialized.<br />The relationship between Ms. Holmes and Safeway’s then-chief executive, Steven Burd, started with a shared vision of making healthcare more accessible but soured as Mr. Burd faced the end of his career with nothing to show from the expensive pursuit of installing Theranos clinics in hundreds of stores."
