    "body": "Having effectively won more time on the clock,  Box  needs to make every minute count.<br />It has been a month since Box, which provides cloud-based collaboration software to businesses, defeated a proxy challenge brought by activist Starboard Value. It wasn’t particularly close: Box co-founder and Chief Executive Aaron Levie drew three times the number of “For” votes as the highest-ranking Starboard nominee. But it wasn’t a slam dunk either. In a report ahead of the Sept. 9 shareholder meeting, influential proxy-advisory firm  ISS  credited Starboard’s involvement for sparking necessary changes at the company. The firm’s recommendation against Starboard’s slate was based on the reasoning that Box’s current board “appears to deserve some additional time to implement the turnaround.”"
