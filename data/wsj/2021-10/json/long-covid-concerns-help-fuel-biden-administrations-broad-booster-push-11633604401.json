    "body": "Emerging data indicating that a small percentage of vaccinated people develop long-term Covid-19 is helping drive the Biden administration’s push to roll out boosters broadly, according to people familiar with the planning.<br />Breakthrough infections among fully vaccinated people remain rare and long Covid cases are more common in unvaccinated people. Yet some federal health regulators see the new data as a reason to offer boosters more widely in the coming weeks, the people said. Other health experts, however, say most people don’t need the extra doses."
