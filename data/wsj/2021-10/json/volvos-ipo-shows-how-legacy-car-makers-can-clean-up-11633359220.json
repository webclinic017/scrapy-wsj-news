    "body": "A $25 billion valuation would be a coup for Volvo Cars and a wake-up call for larger peers—particularly  Volkswagen .<br />The Swedish manufacturer gave details of its long-awaited initial public offering Monday, following a Wall Street Journal report that it was ready to press the button. The company’s confidence seems to be growing that investors will give fair value to its well-articulated strategy to shift from gas-run cars to electric vehicles. That raises important questions for other “legacy” car makers, which are getting little stock-market credit for their own transition plans. What is Volvo doing differently, and can they do it too?"
