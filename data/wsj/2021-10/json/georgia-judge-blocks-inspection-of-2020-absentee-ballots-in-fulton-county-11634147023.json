    "body": "A Georgia state judge dismissed a lawsuit from a voting group that sought to inspect absentee ballots cast in Fulton County, a day after state investigators said they hadn’t found any counterfeit ballots there.<br />Henry County Chief Judge Brian Amero said in his order the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue and blocked their effort to inspect the ballots. It represents the latest in legal defeats for supporters of former President Donald Trump who sought to challenge the 2020 election results."
