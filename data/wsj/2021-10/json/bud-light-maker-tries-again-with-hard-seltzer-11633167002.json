    "body": "The maker of Budweiser tried to jump on the alcoholic seltzer craze years ago—and flopped. The problem, according to Anheuser-Busch’s new chief executive: It was too focused on Bud Light.<br />Now the White Claw brand dominates the hard seltzer market and the category’s growth is slowing. But Anheuser-Busch says it isn’t too late to cash in. It aims to do so by using the marketing heft of its Bud Light and Michelob Ultra brands, along with a new seltzer created with rapper Travis Scott."
