    "body": "Amazing as it may sound, the American worker shortage is getting even worse. For the second consecutive month, the number of small businesses reporting they could not find workers to fill open positions set a new record high. Given this historically tight labor market, it’s no surprise that the number of small firms raising compensation also hit a record high. That’s according to the latest monthly employment survey from the National Federation of Independent Business, due out later today.<br />“Fifty-one percent (seasonally adjusted) of all owners reported job openings they could not fill in the current period, up 1 point from August and a record high reading for the second consecutive month. The number of unfilled job openings far exceeds the 48-year historical average of 22 percent,” reports NFIB Chief Economist William Dunkelberg."
