    "body": "WASHINGTON—Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R., Ill.), one of 10 GOP lawmakers who voted to impeach then President Donald Trump on a charge of inciting an insurrection at the Capitol, said on Friday that he wouldn’t run for re-election next year.<br />Mr. Kinzinger’s decision comes as he was increasingly at odds with members of his own party, many of whom remain loyal to Mr. Trump, and as he faced a tough re-election fight for his seventh term in the House after his district was redrawn."
