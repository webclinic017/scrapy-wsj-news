    "body": "WASHINGTON—The State Department plans organizational changes to confront international-cybersecurity challenges such as ransomware and waning global digital freedom, U.S. officials said, the latest overhaul by the Biden administration aimed at treating cyber threats as a top-tier national-security issue.<br />The restructuring will include the creation of a new bureau of cyberspace and digital policy to be led by a Senate-confirmed ambassador-at-large and a new, separate special envoy for critical and emerging technology, officials said. Both positions will report directly to Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman for at least the first year, the officials said. The administration hasn’t decided who will fill either role."
