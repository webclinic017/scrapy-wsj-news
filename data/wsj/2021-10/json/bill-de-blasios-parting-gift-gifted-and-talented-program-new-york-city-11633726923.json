    "body": "The foremost principle of the modern progressive is leveling everyone down. So it goes that New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, weeks from leaving office, has decided to kill the city’s gifted-and-talented program for elementary students.<br />He says the city will eliminate the entrance exam given to 4-year-olds, which sees about 2,500 students admitted to the program each year. Critics say that this is too young to sort out high achievers, and that it contributes to a school system in which whites and Asian-Americans are overrepresented in elite programs."
