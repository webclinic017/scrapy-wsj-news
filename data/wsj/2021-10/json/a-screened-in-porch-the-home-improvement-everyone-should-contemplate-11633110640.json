    "body": "YEARS AGO, when I floated the idea of a screened-in porch to my opinionated, renovation-savvy friends, some thought it frivolous. One considered the plan old-fashioned. “I don’t get it,” she said. But I did. My house in Springs, N.Y., which I bought in 2014, is in a woodsy area, 350 steps from the harbor. At the time, I simply wanted a breezy, outdoor, mosquito-free zone. But my fresh-air haven became much more.<br />A year almost to the day after I finished my porch, Covid-19 forced us into lockdown. That summer, my pandemic dinner pod was able to eat together, al fresco but covered, even if it rained, at a time when eating with mixed households indoors was deemed a bad idea. Deep into winter, we bundled up in down and fleece and sat on my porch eating cassoulet like we were in Paris, even when it snowed."
