    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”Researchers at a Wuhan, China, laboratory were probably unaware of the existence of the virus that causes Covid-19 before the pandemic began in late 2019, and if it leaked from the lab, it was likely the result of an accident not connected to deliberate genetic engineering, a U.S. intelligence report released on Friday said.<br />The declassified 17-page report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, expanding on a brief summary released in August, found that without more information from China, U.S. government analysts cannot determine whether the global pandemic emerged when the virus passed to humans from an animal, or from a laboratory accident."
