    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Securities and Exchange Commission is asking a federal judge to require Sen. Richard Burr’s brother-in-law to testify in an enforcement probe that examines possible insider trading by both men.<br />U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman has scheduled a Friday hearing to consider the SEC’s request for testimony from Gerald Fauth, who is chairman of the National Mediation Board and Mr. Burr’s brother-in-law. The SEC says the order is necessary because Mr. Fauth has “waged a relentless battle to avoid” complying with a SEC subpoena issued in May 2020, according to a court filing."
