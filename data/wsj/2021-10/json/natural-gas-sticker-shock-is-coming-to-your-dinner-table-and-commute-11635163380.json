    "body": "High natural-gas prices today mean your electricity and heating bills will likely be expensive this winter. Next year, it could mean you will end up paying more to eat and to fill up your car.<br />In Europe, where natural gas is almost six times as expensive as it was a year earlier, fertilizer companies—including Norwegian company  Yara ,  as well as BASF and Borealis—have announced curtailments as a result of expensive gas. Fertilizer production in the region has dropped as much as 40% as a result of tight supplies, according to CME Group. Natural gas can account for up to 85% of the production cost of ammonia, a key ingredient for many fertilizers, according to estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture."
