    "body": "MEXICO CITY—Mexico is weighing a bill to change the country’s constitution to boost state control of the electricity industry, a move that would jeopardize billions of dollars of investments by private power generators and could lead to international lawsuits by energy firms.<br />The bill, unveiled Friday by President Andres Manuel López Obrador, could face a hard time in Mexico’s Congress, where Mr. López Obrador’s leftist party lacks the two-thirds majority needed to change the constitution."
