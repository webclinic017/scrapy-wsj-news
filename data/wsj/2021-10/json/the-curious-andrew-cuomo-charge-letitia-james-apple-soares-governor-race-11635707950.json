    "body": "Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was charged last week with groping an aide in 2020 just as Attorney General Letitia James, who played a key role in forcing him from office, announced her bid for Governor. That timing, which redounds to Ms. James’ political benefit, could be a coincidence—but it raises questions about political motivations in the justice system that can’t be ignored.<br />Mr. Cuomo has faced a series of sexual harassment allegations. He denied the allegations, but he resigned under pressure after lawyers hired by Ms. James issued a report in August concluding that his conduct amounted to sexual harassment."
