    "body": "The gap between yields on shorter- and longer-term Treasurys narrowed Wednesday after data showed inflation accelerated slightly in September, fueled by investors’ bets that the Federal Reserve may need to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which helps set borrowing costs on everything from corporate debt to mortgages, finished the trading session at 1.549%, according to Tradeweb. That is down from 1.579% at Tuesday’s close. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 2.041%, from 2.106% Tuesday."
