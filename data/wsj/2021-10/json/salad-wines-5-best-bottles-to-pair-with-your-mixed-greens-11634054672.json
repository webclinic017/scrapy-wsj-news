    "body": "SALAD HAS NEVER BEEN very important to me. It’s rarely, if ever, the centerpiece of my meal, so I just don’t tend to think about it in terms of wine pairing.<br />Wine and salad have, in fact, long been considered adversaries, mostly due to the acidity of some salad dressings. And yet, as many oenophiles seem to be eating less meat and more greens, it seemed worth considering the pairing more closely. So I bought a few bottles I thought might prove suitable and tried them along with an unreasonable number of salads."
