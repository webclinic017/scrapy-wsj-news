    "body": "In 49 states in America, people are free to bake cookies or cakes at home and then sell them at a local farmer’s market. But not in New Jersey, where a home baker who tried that would face a fine of up to $1,000.<br />Until this week. On Monday the state’s Department of Health published new rules that now allow people who bake from home to get a $100 “cottage food” license to sell their goods to friends, neighbors and other eager customers. “I am beyond happy that New Jersey finally has a cottage food law and has caught up with the rest of the country,” says Martha Rabello, a board member of the New Jersey Home Bakers Association."
