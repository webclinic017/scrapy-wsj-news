    "body": "Google needed its latest earnings report to be perfect. It was almost there.<br />Parent company  Alphabet Inc.  came into its third-quarter report Tuesday afternoon as the hottest stock in big tech. Its shares are up 59% year to date—easily exceeding the 18% gain averaged by  Apple ,   Amazon ,   Microsoft  and  Facebook .  That set a high bar for the company’s results, particularly when privacy changes by Apple and production shortages rippling through the economy are weighing on other companies dependent on internet advertising."
