    "body": "A student at George Mason University complained about Congress last month. The allocation of U.S. funds to the Iron Dome, Israel’s missile-defense system, “hurts my heart,” she said, “because it’s an ethnic genocide and displacement of people, the same that happened in America.”<br />In response to the student’s comment, America’s vice president nodded. “Your truth should not be suppressed,” she said."
