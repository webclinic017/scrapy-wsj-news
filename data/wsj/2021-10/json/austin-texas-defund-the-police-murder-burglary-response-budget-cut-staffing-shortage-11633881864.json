    "body": "Cut police funding, and you get less policing. That’s what Austin residents are learning the hard way this month as law enforcement tries to triage its emergency response amid a severe staffing shortage.<br />Beginning this month, the Austin Police Department has asked the public not to call 911 for “non-emergency situations” if “there is no immediate threat to life or property,” “where crimes are no longer in progress,” and “when the suspect(s) are no longer on scene or in sight.” The directive applies to burglaries, thefts, prostitution, vandalism, and several other crimes. The police urged victims and witnesses to call 311 or file a report online instead."
