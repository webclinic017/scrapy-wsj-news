    "body": "Shortages are making it harder and more expensive for Americans to find what they want to buy. That didn’t stop them in September.<br />Supply-chain issues and inflation may count as big problems for U.S. consumers, but the pandemic is still what matters most. Covid cases fell last month, and people spent more.

Economists expected a decline of 0.2%. The Commerce Department also upwardly revised its August and July sales figures."
