    "body": "TOKYO—Japan’s Princess Mako married her college sweetheart, became a commoner and, hours later, denounced the media for what she said were groundless reports that drove her to despair.<br />In a statement before the cameras at a Tokyo hotel, Mako said she was the one who urged her then-fiance and now husband, Kei Komuro, to establish a new life in the U.S., suggesting she found the scrutiny of being a royal in Japan unbearable. Mr. Komuro received a law degree from Fordham University’s law school this year after three years of study, and the couple plans to move to New York."
