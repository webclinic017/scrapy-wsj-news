Baime.<br />When I was younger, I decided that I wanted to learn to drive really well. I went to stunt-driving school, rally-racing school and high-performance driving school. I started driving professionally in drift competitions and drag racing. In 2012, I won the Rally America B-Spec National Championship with my co-driver (we were the first all-female team to win this title). People ask me all the time: What is your daily driver?"
