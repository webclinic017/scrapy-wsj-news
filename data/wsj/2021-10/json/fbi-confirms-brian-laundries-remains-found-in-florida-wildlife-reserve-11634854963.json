    "body": "Human remains found in a Florida nature reserve are those of Brian Laundrie, a person of interest in the death of his fiancée Gabby Petito, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said Thursday, after a weekslong manhunt that garnered national attention.<br />Investigators earlier this week had found what appeared to be human remains and a backpack and notebook that belonged to Mr. Laundrie in the Carlton Reserve near Myakkahatchee Creek Environmental Park in North Port, Fla., Michael McPherson, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Tampa field office, said Wednesday. The area had been underwater until recently, Mr. McPherson said, making search efforts for the team more challenging."
