    "body": "U.S. inflation likely remained high in September, as pandemic-related shortages of labor and materials continued to push up prices.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimate the Labor Department will report the consumer-price index—which measures what consumers pay for goods and services—rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in September from August. That is the same pace as in August and down markedly from June’s 0.9% pace, but wouldn’t be enough to slow inflation last month compared with a year ago, economists say."
