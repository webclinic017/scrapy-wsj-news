    "body": "Colleges are in a great position: They can sell their product at the price they want knowing that students will take out loans to pay for it (“Student-Debt Crisis Ensnares Parents,” Page One, Oct. 14).<br />Colleges won’t face consequences if students don’t do well. As an investment manager, I am required to disclose to our investors the risks inherent to our investment strategy, that the returns may be unpredictable and that there can be no assurance that we will meet our investment objective. The civil-liability provisions of the federal securities laws impose those obligations and expose me to severe sanctions. It is time for colleges to use similar disclosures and tell students that no assurances are given to them regarding their future performance in the job market and ability to repay the loans. Maybe reading those 20-page risks disclosures will prompt students to think twice."
