    "body": "WASHINGTON—A $150 billion program aimed at pushing utilities to draw more power from clean-energy sources is in danger of falling out of Democrats’ social-policy and climate bill, according to people familiar with the negotiations, as Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) remains opposed to the provision.<br />A centerpiece of the package’s climate measures, the clean-electricity performance program as drafted in the House, would provide grants to utilities that increase the amount of clean electricity they generate by at least 4% a year, while penalizing utilities that don’t meet that standard."
