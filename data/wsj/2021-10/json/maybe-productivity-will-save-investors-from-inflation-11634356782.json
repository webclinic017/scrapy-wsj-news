    "body": "I’ve spent a lot of time this year on the twin threats of inflation and rising bond yields. Add in soaring energy prices and pending Christmas shortages and it sometimes feels like everything’s awful. But there is a bull case to be made that two decades of depressed productivity are about to come to an end.<br />The basic case is that companies are investing again, and that higher capital spending quickly translates into a lift in productivity. The headwinds that held back spending in the last two cycles—caution following the aftermath of the dot-com excess and a lack of credit after the 2008 financial crisis—have gone. And companies have a strong incentive to invest, because labor is no longer cheap, with wages rising fast and firms reporting difficulties in hiring."
