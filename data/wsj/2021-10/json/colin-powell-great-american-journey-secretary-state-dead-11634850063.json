    "body": "Condoleezza Rice tells a story that she wrote about this week in the Washington Post after the death of Colin Powell. We spoke about it by phone.<br />It was 2003, President George W. Bush’s first state visit to Britain, and there was a dinner in Buckingham Palace given by the queen. Ms. Rice, then White House national security adviser, found herself in a sitting room off the banquet hall with Secretary of State Powell and his wife, Alma Johnson Powell. It was very grand, the women in gowns, Colin in white tie and tails. Talk turned to the past. Condi and Mrs. Powell were daughters of the segregated South, raised in Birmingham, Ala. In 1963, when the 16th Street Baptist Church was bombed by white supremacists, Condi, blocks away in her home, heard the blast and learned that a little girl she played dolls with had been murdered, along with three others. Alma’s father had been principal of the largest black high school in Birmingham, and her uncle principal at the second-largest, where Condi’s father had been a guidance counselor. Colin, raised in the South Bronx, had served in the South in the 1950s, and knew Birmingham from courting Alma."
