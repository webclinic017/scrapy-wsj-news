    "body": "As gig economy companies work to woo drivers back to their platforms, they have been making some expensive promises. Breaking them could prove even more costly.<br />On Tuesday, the Federal Trade Commission said it sent a notice of penalty offenses to more than 1,100 companies, warning that those that mislead people about potential earnings could incur fines that can exceed $43,000 per offense. For gig economy companies, this includes “pitching a steady second income” for drivers that may prove to be less than advertised, the agency said.  Uber Technologies  (as well as Uber Eats),  DoorDash ,  Instacart and  Lyft  all received the notice."
