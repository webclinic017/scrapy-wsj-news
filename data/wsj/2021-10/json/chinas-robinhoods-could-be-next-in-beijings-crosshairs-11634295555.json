    "body": "China’s regulatory crackdown has already slowed trading flows for its Robinhood-like online brokers. Now data security is a new problem. And tougher enforcement of existing rules on cross-border investment on top of all that could add up to an existential threat for these brokers.<br />Shares of Nasdaq-listed Chinese online brokerages took a dive Thursday after state media questioned their ability to comply with the country’s new data-privacy law that goes into effect next month. Tencent-backed Futu lost 12% while Up Fintech, usually known as Tiger Brokers, plunged 21%. These online trading platforms are used by mostly Chinese investors to trade stocks listed in the U.S. and Hong Kong, and are popular because they charge low fees."
