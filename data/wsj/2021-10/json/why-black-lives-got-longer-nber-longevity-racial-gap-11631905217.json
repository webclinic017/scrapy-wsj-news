    "body": "The central divide in America’s racial politics is over whether the country has made any progress at all. Liberals and conservatives used to agree that the social position of black Americans has greatly improved since the civil-rights movement. But an ascendant left is challenging that consensus with a new narrative in which racism became “systemic,” Jim Crow segregation gave way to a “new Jim Crow” of disguised white supremacy, and the color-blind ideal is itself suspect.<br />Allegedly supporting that radical view are statistics showing stubborn gaps in black and white life outcomes, including on crime, education and wealth. But a recent examination of life-expectancy data from the National Bureau of Economic Research reminds us that on that crucial metric, progress has been significant."
