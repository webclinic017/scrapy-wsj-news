    "body": "A CLASSIC Wellington—beef tenderloin smothered in a paté-enhanced mushroom duxelles, baked within a pastry crust—is a dish I’ve always treasured at the table and found elusive in the kitchen. The first time I ventured to make it, I found out why the Wellington is usually reserved for special occasions: Laborious and tricky, the recipe is a minefield of kitchen disasters waiting to happen. If all goes well, expect a juicy, crisp-crusted, richly flavored centerpiece to a festive meal with a tremendous wow factor. If not, you’re left with a soggy log encircling bland, dried-out meat—after a day toiling in the kitchen.<br />With the approaching holiday in mind, I asked three chefs for their top tips on how to avoid the most common Wellington pitfalls. Their advice and trusty recipes follow."
