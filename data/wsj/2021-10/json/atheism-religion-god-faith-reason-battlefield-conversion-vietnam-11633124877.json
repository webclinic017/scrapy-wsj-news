    "body": "Like Michael Guillen, I was also a confirmed atheist (“Why Atheists Need Faith,” Houses of Worship, Sept. 24). But unlike his studied journey to faith, my conversion to something else was rapid and explosive. It occurred when I was a flight surgeon for a fighter squadron during the Vietnam War.<br />I did my doctoring in the dispensary on base—mostly venereal disease, minor trauma and various aches and pains. I bunked, ate, drank and flew with my squadron. One day in February 1971, one of the back seaters in the squadron gave me some unsolicited advice. He asked if I ever flew gunship escorts and I responded that I did and was scheduled for just such a mission three nights hence. He continued: Was I in the habit of looking back at the antiaircraft gun that we had just attacked as we were climbing back to altitude? I said I had never done that, and he noted that smart enemy gunners knew that we rolled left as we climbed and, while they could not see us, they would tail-shoot our aircraft if our suppression was off. I thanked him for the unbidden advice and have spent 50 years now offering thanks."
