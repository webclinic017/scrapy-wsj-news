    "body": "Budweiser brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev SA sold more beer at higher prices in the third quarter, as strong demand in South America helped make up for weakness in the U.S., where drinkers switched away from beer and supply chains were disrupted.<br />The world’s largest beer company Thursday said revenue rose 7.9% in the period, with volumes up 3.4%, as drinkers reached for pricier brews. Both those figures beat analyst forecasts and prompted the company to raise its full-year earnings guidance.  AB InBev ’s  shares rose over 7% in early trading in Europe."
