    "body": "President Biden has plenty to do as congressional Democrats struggle to pass the tax increases and entitlement expansions that are the core of his agenda. So it’s notable that for much of Monday Mr. Biden was not in Washington but New Jersey with Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who is up for re-election next week.<br />Mr. Murphy appeared for months to be coasting to victory, but Republican Jack Ciattarelli is putting up a spirited fight in the heavily suburban state. A close race, to say nothing of a Democratic defeat, would add to the headwinds against progressive policies nationwide."
