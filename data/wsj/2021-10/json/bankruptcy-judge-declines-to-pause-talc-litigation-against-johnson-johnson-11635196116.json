    "body": "A bankruptcy judge refused an initial bid to pause talc litigation against  Johnson & Johnson ,  setting the stage for a November hearing that will likely scrutinize the corporate maneuvering the company undertook to try to settle thousands of personal-injury lawsuits through a subsidiary’s chapter 11.<br />Judge J. Craig Whitley of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Charlotte, N.C., on Friday refused to extend to J&J a temporary restraining order that would have halted lawsuits against the consumer-goods giant during the two-week period before next month’s hearing."
