    "body": "The Biden Administration has botched immigration policy as badly as it did the Afghanistan withdrawal, and it now may suffer the indignity of re-adopting a Trump-era border policy that candidate Joe Biden denounced as un-American.<br />“Donald Trump’s ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy is dangerous, inhumane, and goes against everything we stand for as a nation of immigrants. My administration will end it,” Mr. Biden tweeted in March 2020. That was when Mr. Biden was courting the left."
