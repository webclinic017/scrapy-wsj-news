S. soldiers and volunteers are wrestling with logistical and cultural barriers as they transform a rural military base into a small city hosting nearly 13,000 Afghan evacuees.<br />The Army overcame early hurdles, such as understanding Afghan food preferences, but the persistent need for volunteers and the realities of housing foreign civilians on a base designed for spartan military training threaten to strain the effort as it stretches into the winter with no certain dates for resettlement."
