Bean catalog in 1944, it was called the Ice Carrier, marketed to “those who have found difficulty in carrying ice from car to ice chest.” It launched again in 1965 in a trimmer form and with a sunnier disposition, rebranded as the “Boat and Tote”; it now sported colored handles and came in various sizes and colors."
