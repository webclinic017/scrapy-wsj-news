    "body": "Members of a congressional committee questioned whether  Amazon . com Inc. executives misled them during an investigation of the company’s business practices and if they may have lied under oath.<br />In a letter sent to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on Sunday, five members of Congress asked the company to provide “exculpatory evidence” to corroborate the sworn testimony that several leaders, including then-CEO Jeff Bezos, provided to the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee in 2019 and 2020. The letter was signed by Reps. David Cicilline (D., R.I.), Ken Buck (R., Colo.), Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash.), Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) and Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.). The subcommittee probed Amazon’s use of data from third-party sellers as it has developed private-label products."
