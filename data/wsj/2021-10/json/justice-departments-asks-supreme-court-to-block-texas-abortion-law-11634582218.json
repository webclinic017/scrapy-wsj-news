    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Justice Department on Monday filed an emergency request with the Supreme Court that seeks to block Texas’ ban on most abortions, returning the issue to the justices after they previously declined to intervene against the new state law.<br />The department’s high-court filing said the Texas measure, which bans abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, is in open defiance of Supreme Court rulings that have protected abortion rights for a half-century. “Texas has, in short, successfully nullified this court’s decisions within its borders,” the department wrote."
