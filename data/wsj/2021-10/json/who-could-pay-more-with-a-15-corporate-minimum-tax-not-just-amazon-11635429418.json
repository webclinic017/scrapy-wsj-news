    "body": "Democratic lawmakers are pushing a proposal that would seek to collect more taxes from dozens of large companies such as  Amazon . com Inc. that record sizable profits but report little or no tax expense.<br />The push for a new corporate minimum tax comes as Democrats abandon plans to raise the 21% federal corporate rate to help fund spending on healthcare, education and climate-change initiatives. Instead, they hope to raise hundreds of billions of dollars over 10 years by setting a minimum 15% federal tax rate on large companies, based on the profits companies report to investors."
