    "body": "I TRAVELED to Munich last month during an uptick in the Delta variant, which required taking multiple Covid tests with those extra-long nasal swabs they use in Germany. But a chance to drive  BMW ’s  new iX all-electric premium crossover was nothing to sneeze at.<br />If (and only if) you follow the auto industry, you know that BMW’s i division was created in 2011 to develop and sell electrified mobility products to practically no one. One of the wonders of BMW-land is the Zaha Hadid-designed factory in Leipzig, where legions of robots glue and screw together the carbon-fiber-bodied i3s in sun-flooded ateliers. They really knew how to spend money back then."
