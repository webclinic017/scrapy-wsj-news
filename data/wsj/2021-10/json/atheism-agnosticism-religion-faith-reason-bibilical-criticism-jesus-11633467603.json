    "body": "As a former minister turned agnostic, I enjoyed reading “Why Atheists Need Faith” (Houses of Worship, Sept. 24) by Michael Guillen, a scientist and former atheist turned Christian. Just as Mr. Guillen arrived at Christianity during his doctoral studies by debunking core tenets of his atheistic worldview, I left Christianity by studying the New Testament, not through the lens of faith, but in graduate and postgraduate settings through the lens of the historical-critical method of biblical scholarship. It raises questions about the authorship and authenticity of scripture.<br />For me, the paucity of extrabiblical evidence for even the existence of Jesus, let alone the historical-critical problems with his alleged resurrection, led me to abandon my faith (and career as a Baptist minister), a faith that had been foundational since childhood."
