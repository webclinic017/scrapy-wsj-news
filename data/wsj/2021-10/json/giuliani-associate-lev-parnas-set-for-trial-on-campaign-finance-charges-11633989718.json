    "body": "A former associate of Rudy Giuliani is set to go to trial Tuesday on campaign-finance charges, bringing renewed attention to a key figure in former President Donald Trump’s first impeachment and the push by federal investigators to root out foreign influence in U.S. elections.<br />The criminal trial of Lev Parnas, 49 years old, is only tangentially related to what made him a figure of national scrutiny in 2019—his role aiding former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s effort to persuade Ukrainian officials to investigate Joe Biden, then Mr. Trump’s top Democratic rival, and Mr. Biden’s son Hunter. Mr. Parnas has said he arranged meetings and carried messages for Mr. Giuliani in Ukraine and has spoken of having a role in the removal of the U.S. ambassador in Kyiv."
