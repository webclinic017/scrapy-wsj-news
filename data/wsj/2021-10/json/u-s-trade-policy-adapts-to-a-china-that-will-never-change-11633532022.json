    "body": "President Biden’s top trade official this week delivered an unusually bleak assessment of U.S. efforts over the past two decades to change China’s trade practices, from subsidies and intellectual property to technology transfer.<br />In annual bilateral talks, the U.S. extracted commitments of reform that proved “inconsistent and impossible to enforce,” U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said. When the U.S. won cases at the World Trade Organization, China didn’t change its underlying policies, she said. Former President Donald Trump’s tariffs led to a limited trade deal that “did not meaningfully address the fundamental concerns” with China’s behavior, Ms. Tai said."
