    "body": "Countless young adults have moved back home during the Covid-19 pandemic. At first it was mostly a good way to navigate the lockdowns, spend time with family and save money. But for many parents and children, it turned out to be something more: an opportunity for both of them to learn some important financial lessons.<br />The pandemic, it seems, was an ideal backdrop for families to put their finances under the microscope, and learn from each other as they adjusted to living under the same roof again. Parents and their adult children were able to pick up on one another’s good financial habits, and drop bad ones. And the experience also has helped some young adults rethink their financial goals."
