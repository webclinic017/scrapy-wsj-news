    "body": "If Beijing has a grand plan for dealing with the slow-rolling collapse of property giant Evergrande Group, it’s one of the best kept secrets in Asia. It’s clear that Xi Jinping’s government will step in to protect at least some of Evergrande’s creditors, but uncertainty about who will benefit and how is becoming another risk.<br />Investors and Chinese policy makers had known for months about Evergrande’s problem managing more than $300 billion in liabilities. Since August the company has missed three coupon payments on bonds issued outside China, although it isn’t in default thanks to 30-day grace periods."
