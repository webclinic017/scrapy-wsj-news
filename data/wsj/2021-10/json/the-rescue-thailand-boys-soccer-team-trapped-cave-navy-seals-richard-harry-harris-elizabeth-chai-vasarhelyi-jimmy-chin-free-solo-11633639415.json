    "body": "Claustrophobes beware, but even you may find “The Rescue” enthralling. It’s a National Geographic documentary, playing in theaters, about the international effort, organized at a feverish pace in June 2018, to rescue 12 boys and their soccer coach trapped in a flooded cave in northern Thailand. The directors were Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin. They won an Oscar in 2019 for “Free Solo,” a literal cliff-hanger of a doc about a climber ascending the sheer wall of El Capitan, the 3,200-foot monolith in Yosemite National Park, without the usual array of climbing equipment or safety gear. Their latest film chronicles the skill and unfathomable courage of divers who descended into the darkness of a labyrinthine system of caves, risking entrapment in the tightest of spaces by rapidly rising water. The stuff of heroism is always mysterious. In this case it’s also marvelously strange.<br />Chances are you recall the end of the story, which spanned more than two weeks and, during most of that time, figured prominently in news coverage around the world. Even so, the suspense will be almost unendurable. I wrote that about “Free Solo” and it’s no less true here, because the fate of the teenage athletes and their coach is tied to the safety of the divers. Every dive is fraught with peril, every constricted chamber in the vast subterranean maze could turn out to be a death trap. (Although a movie about confined spaces might seem a logical candidate for viewing on home screens—and though some of the diving scenes are, of necessity, re-enactments—try to see “The Rescue” in a theater before it goes to streaming. Only the big screen can do justice to the remarkable scale and complexity of the endeavor, which involved almost 5,000 Thais and more than 10,000 people altogether.)"
