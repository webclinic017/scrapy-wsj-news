    "body": "PEOPLE TRY to put Gen Z down, just because they get around. But since 2015, the generally awesome Honda Civic has been the bestselling light vehicle in the U.S. among “first-time buyers, Millennials, Gen Z and multicultural customers,” says the company. Seems to me the kids are alright.<br />Our guest, the 2022 Honda Civic 1.5T Touring—representing the new, 11th design generation of Civic compact (available in sedan and hatchback body styles)—will test something of an untried principle in the showroom, a post peak-car strategy. Call it Civique Classique. Here, the U.S.-market Civic is nearing its end-stage evolution, carrying into perpetuity this more formal-looking exterior and understated grille design, harking back to the ’90s Accord. See it hark? Also note the lower hoodline and the hidden windshield wipers, which helped create the old Civic’s expansive world view."
