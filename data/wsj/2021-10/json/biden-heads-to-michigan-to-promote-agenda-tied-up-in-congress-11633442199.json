    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden traveled to Michigan Tuesday to build public support for his agenda, pitching it as a necessary investment for the U.S. to remain competitive, as Congress wrestles with two legislative packages stacked with his priorities.<br />Mr. Biden visited a union facility in Howell, Mich., to talk up a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package that passed the Senate in August and is waiting for a vote in the House. Progressives say they won’t vote for the proposal unless lawmakers reach a deal on a second, larger set of proposals, including new spending on healthcare, education and child care."
