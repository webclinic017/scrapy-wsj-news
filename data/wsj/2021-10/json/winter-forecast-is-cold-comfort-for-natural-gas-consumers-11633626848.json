    "body": "Hereâ€™s something that might take some pressure out of the fear building in natural-gas markets: A closely watched forecast from the Natural Gas Supply Association says that the U.S. winter will be just slightly colder than last year. That might not be enough to take the edge off of prices, though.<br />The association said in its presentation on Thursday that winter will be 1% colder than last year and roughly in line with the past three winters. If the season pans out the way NGSA expects, the U.S. will end up with 1.7 trillion cubic feet of gas in underground storage by the end of March, 6.3% below the five-year average but enough to quell any fears about an actual physical shortage of the commodity. If temperatures turn out to be similar to the cold winter of 2013-2014, however, the NGSA forecasts that storage will start approaching a trillion cubic feet in March, a level that could cause prices to spike."
