    "body": "NEW YORK—Disbarred attorney Steven Donziger is set to be sentenced Friday for contempt of court after a federal judge concluded that he willfully violated orders stemming from a three-decade-long legal crusade against  Chevron Corp.  over pollution in the Ecuadorean rainforest.<br />Friday’s sentencing follows a July ruling by U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in New York finding Mr. Donziger guilty of six counts of criminal contempt of court. She found that he disobeyed court orders as he sought to enforce a $9.5 billion judgment that he won against the oil giant in Ecuador and that he was barred from profiting from."
