    "body": "Migration to rich countries plummeted last year as the Covid-19 pandemic closed businesses and borders, but a rebound is under way as shortages of workers bite and industries that had come to rely heavily on migrant labor over the past two decades reopened.<br />In its annual report on the movement of people across borders, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based research body, said the number of migrants arriving in its mostly rich-country members fell by almost a third to 3.7 million, the largest drop since records began in 2003."
