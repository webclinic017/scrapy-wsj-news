    "body": "Federal judges would be required to report stock trades over $1,000 within 45 days and post their financial-disclosure forms online under legislation proposed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the Senate and House of Representatives.<br />The two bills, to be introduced as soon as today, have been drafted by both Democrats and Republicans in response to a Wall Street Journal investigation finding 131 federal judges violated federal law by hearing lawsuits involving companies in which they reported owning stock, according to congressional aides."
