    "body": "Despite his long track record of commercial and critical success, Ron Howard has seldom been written about as a filmmaker with a strong personal vision. Yet if one judges on matters of outlook and tone, Mr. Howard is indisputably an auteur.<br />As a young actor—first as Opie on “The Andy Griffith Show,” and then as a male lead in the classic film “American Graffiti” (1973) and the television series “Happy Days”—Mr. Howard unfailingly projected an aw-shucks wholesomeness. As a director, he has retained that same upbeat, it-will-all-turn-out-OK attitude in films as eclectic as the aquatic comedy “Splash” (1984), the senior-citizens sci-fi yarn “Cocoon” (1985), the paean to newspapermen and newspaperwomen “The Paper” (1994) and, especially, the true-life account of interstellar heroism “Apollo 13” (1995)."
