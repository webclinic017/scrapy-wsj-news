    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is considering options to offer deportation protections to immigrants working in the country without authorization if they report an abusive employer.<br />The idea is included in an internal memo Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas sent to acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Tae Johnson Tuesday morning, outlining the administration’s goal of pursuing employers who hire immigrants without authorization to work, rather than the employees themselves. The memo asks Mr. Johnson, along with the heads of Customs and Border Protection and Citizenship and Immigration Services, to develop policy options in the next 60 days to carry out that change in enforcement priorities."
