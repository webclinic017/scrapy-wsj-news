    "body": "An early sign that President Biden would follow rather than lead his party was his refusal to repudiate “court-packing” in the 2020 campaign. As President he still had a chance to dismiss the idea as an exercise in constitutional arson. Instead, he appointed a commission to study packing the Supreme Court.<br />The commission is now completing its work as the Justices open a highly contested term with abortion and the Second Amendment on the docket. Its mere existence is a sign of Democratic ambitions to intimidate the Court. But the good news is that the project appears to be ending in disarray. While it may only whet the appetites of progressives over the long run, the Biden court-packing meltdown also signals that norms against political meddling in the judiciary remain intact—for now."
