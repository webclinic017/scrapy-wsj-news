    "body": "With oil and natural gas prices reaching multiyear highs ahead of winter, the world was counting on OPEC and its Russia-led allies to ride to the rescue. The group opted not to, but the industrialized world need not panic.<br />On Monday, the group decided to continue with its original plan to gradually release 400,000 additional barrels a month, ignoring calls from world leaders—notably the White House—to bring additional barrels to the market to cool prices down. Global benchmark Brent crude jumped above $81.50 a barrel Monday, the highest since 2018, and West Texas Intermediate hit a seven-year high."
