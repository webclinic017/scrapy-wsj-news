    "body": "Let’s start with one of the countless details, tiny and large, that make “Lamb” a tale of hypnotic beauty—and one with a wild and woolly premise that could have gone howlingly wrong. It’s what we see immediately after the Icelandic heroine, María, sits down to calm herself by playing the piano. (She’s played powerfully in her turn by Noomi Rapace.) As the first notes are heard, the camera peers inside the instrument at the hammers hitting the strings to make the music. What’s that all about? Well, the hammers are made of felt, which comes from wool, which comes from sheep.<br />“Lamb,” playing in theaters with English subtitles, is sheepcentric, not to mention eccentric, and the quirky shot contributes to the tone of the film, a debut feature by Valdimar Jóhannsson that is delicately droll as well as frightening, fearlessly silly and weirdly profound. (Eli Arenson did the elegantly austere cinematography. Þórarinn Guðnason wrote the music. Björn Viktorsson created the haunting sound design.)"
