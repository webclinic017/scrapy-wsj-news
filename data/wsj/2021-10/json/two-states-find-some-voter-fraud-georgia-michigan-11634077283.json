    "body": "In the eyes of many Democrats, any push to ensure ballot integrity amounts to voter suppression, while Georgia’s inquiry into Atlanta’s elections is nothing more than a prelude to a power grab. Yet this week two Georgia election workers were fired for shredding voter registration forms, and three Michigan women were charged with fraud.<br />Georgia’s performance review of elections in Fulton County, which includes most of Atlanta, has largely been painted as a GOP plot to take over the handling of ballots in a blue area. Yes, the state’s new voting law theoretically gives it the power to suspend local election boards. But that’s only after a lengthy process, which must include a finding of malfeasance, gross negligence, or the like. And Fulton County has a long record of screw-ups."
