    "body": "Former President Donald Trump is taking his most affirmative step yet toward a possible 2024 campaign by returning to a crucial state on the nominating calendar for the first time since his presidency, even as Republicans there express mixed feelings about him running again.<br />Mr. Trump will host a rally Saturday evening in Iowa, the state that traditionally launches the nomination process. His event on the state fairgrounds in Des Moines is likely to stoke speculation about his previously stated interest in trying to win back the White House and follows his hiring of two operatives in the state to work for his political-action committee."
