    "body": "SINGAPORE— Fantasia Holdings Group Co. , a developer of luxury apartments in China, said it didn’t make a $206 million U.S. dollar bond payment that was due Oct. 4, adding to the malaise surrounding the country’s highly indebted property companies.<br />The company, which like  China Evergrande Group  is based in Shenzhen, said late Monday that it didn’t pay the outstanding principal on a 7.375% bond which it issued in 2016. Fantasia originally sold $500 million of this debt and earlier this year bought back some of the securities."
