    "body": "Ezekiel Emanuel claims that “Reconciliation Offers a Shot at Simpler Government” (op-ed, Oct. 8) and then describes three ways to simplify federal programs through the reconciliation bill. My government-simplification plan is even more basic: Kill the reconciliation bill.<br />I cannot envision a scenario in which passing a multitrillion dollar bill with an array of new entitlements would make government simpler. The first step to simpler government is less government, not more."
