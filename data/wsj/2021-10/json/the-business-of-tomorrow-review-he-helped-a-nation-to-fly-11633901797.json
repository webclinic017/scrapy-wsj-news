    "body": "Aviation geeks like me remember that Charles Lindbergh, returning to America after his epic 1927 flight across the Atlantic, hounded by a starstruck public and obnoxious hordes of newspaper reporters, found refuge on the north shore of Long Island at the elegant and protected estate of one of the country’s wealthiest men, the former World War I flyer Harry F. Guggenheim. In the shelter of Guggenheim’s faux-Norman castle, Falaise, Lindbergh famously retired to a guest room and revised the ghostwritten, error-riddled account of his flight, “We.”<br />But even devoted prop-heads are not likely to know that it was Guggenheim who conceived, planned and financed Lindbergh’s famous goodwill tour over the summer after he returned from crossing the Atlantic. During that three-month excursion across the country, Lindbergh flew his “Spirit of St. Louis” monoplane to packed events in 92 American towns and cities across the 48 continental states. The Lone Eagle’s continental tour cemented his fame and helped turn American aviation into a growth industry for the next half century."
