    "body": "Google on Wednesday introduced new features for its Nest smart thermostat that will let users dial down their use of fossil fuels, the technology company’s latest consumer-facing initiative aimed at addressing climate change.<br />An update to the thermostat’s software, known as Nest Renew, will allow homes to automatically adjust their energy use to tap more renewable power, such as wind and solar. The service will be invite-only until Google, owned by  Alphabet Inc.,  is ready to roll it out across the U.S."
