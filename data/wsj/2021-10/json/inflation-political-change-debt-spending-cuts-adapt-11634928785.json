    "body": "Since excessive inflation is one characteristic outcome of a fiat money system, who is really surprised that such a moment might be on us again? The table would seem to have been set for a long time: Unruly government borrowing. Mounting regulatory burdens and disincentives to business and workers. A decline in labor force participation. The peculiar unwillingness of a large cohort of young men either to work or pursue schooling.<br />Then came the pandemic and the pandemic spending binge, which shifted public demand away from services (no longer available) to goods that the supply chain struggles to deliver."
