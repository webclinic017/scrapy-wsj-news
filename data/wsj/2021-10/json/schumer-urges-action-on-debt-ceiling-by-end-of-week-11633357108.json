    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a letter to colleagues Monday that lawmakers must act to increase the federal government’s borrowing limit by the end of the week to avoid any repercussions, but Democrats didn’t lay out how they planned to pass a bill without Republican votes.<br />“Let me be clear about the task ahead of us: we must get a bill to the president’s desk dealing with the debt limit by the end of the week.
