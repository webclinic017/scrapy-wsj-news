    "body": "The Mom Project Inc., a recruitment firm focused on mothers, raised $80 million in new capital at what may be a pivotal moment for working women and the companies that want to hire them.<br />Mothers, who left the workforce in large numbers during the pandemic, are increasingly able to return to work as schools reopen, said Allison Robinson, co-founder and chief executive of the Chicago-based Mom Project.Â At the same time, companies are becoming more willing to offer flexible job options to them due to talent shortages."
