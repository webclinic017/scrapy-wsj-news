    "body": "The federal judiciary is planning a new electronic financial-disclosure system to spot judges’ conflicts, but the chairwoman of the judiciary’s ethics committee stopped short of promising an end to long delays in getting those reports to the public.<br />“In some cases the release of reports takes too long,” Judge Jennifer Elrod said in written testimony for a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing Tuesday. She said the judiciary “has been engaged in continuing efforts to develop and implement a new electronic financial disclosure system.”"
