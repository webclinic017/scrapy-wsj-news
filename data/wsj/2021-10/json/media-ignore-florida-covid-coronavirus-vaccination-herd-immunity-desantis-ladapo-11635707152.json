    "body": "St. Petersburg, Fla.<br />Florida went from having the country’s highest rate of Covid infections to the lowest in about two months.

Is Florida’s infection rate lower than in states with significantly higher vaccination rates and mandates? Are those policies futile or counterproductive? Are Floridians now close to herd immunity?"
