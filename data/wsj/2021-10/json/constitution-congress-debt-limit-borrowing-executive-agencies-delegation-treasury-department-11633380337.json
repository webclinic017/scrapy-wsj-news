    "body": "The U.S. national debt is near its statutory limit of $28.4 trillion, and Congress has to act this month to prevent the government from defaulting on its financial obligations. Lawmakers are considering whether to increase the limit or—as Democrats prefer—simply to suspend it for a time and allow the Treasury to decide how much debt to take on to meet federal financial obligations.<br />But although Congresses controlled by both parties have used the latter approach in recent years, it is unconstitutional. Article I Section 8 gives Congress the authority to “borrow money on the credit of the United States.” It doesn’t permit wholesale delegation of that core legislative power to the executive branch."
