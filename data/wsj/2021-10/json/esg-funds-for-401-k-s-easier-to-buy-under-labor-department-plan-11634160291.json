    "body": "The Department of Labor on Wednesday proposed a rule that would make it easier for investors to purchase funds focused on environment, social and governance measures in their 401(k) plans.<br />These types of funds have become increasingly popular in recent years as individuals seek to invest in ways more consistent with their own personal values. The proposal has been supported by many Wall Street firms, which are rolling out such offerings to meet demand."
