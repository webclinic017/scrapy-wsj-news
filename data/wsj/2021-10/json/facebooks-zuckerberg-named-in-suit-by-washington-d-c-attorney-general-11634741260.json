    "body": "WASHINGTON—The District of Columbia’s attorney general is seeking to hold  Facebook Inc.  Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg personally liable in a lawsuit stemming from the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal, in what the district said was a novel legal action against the social-media giant.<br />Attorney General Karl Racine said Wednesday he filed a motion to add Mr. Zuckerberg as a defendant in a consumer-protection lawsuit originally filed in December 2018 accusing Facebook of misleading its users about the privacy and security of their personal data. His office said it was the first time a U.S. regulator has specifically named Mr. Zuckerberg in a complaint."
