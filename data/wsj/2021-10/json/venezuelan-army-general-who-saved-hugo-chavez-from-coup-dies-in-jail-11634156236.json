    "body": "Raúl Baduel, an army general who became a hero of Venezuela’s leftist government when he helped its strongman survive a coup but later turned into one of its most prominent political prisoners, died in jail late Tuesday, his family and the government said. He was 66.<br />The death of Gen. Baduel, a confidant of the socialist leader Hugo Chávez before becoming a dissident, was announced in a Twitter post by Venezuela’s attorney general, who said Gen. Baduel had suffered a cardiac failure triggered by Covid-19. He died awaiting trial for treason in what is commonly called “The Tomb,” an underground Caracas detention center run by the country’s military intelligence."
