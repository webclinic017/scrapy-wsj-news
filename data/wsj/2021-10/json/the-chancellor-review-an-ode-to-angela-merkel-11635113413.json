    "body": "To label Kati Marton’s biography of Angela Merkel a hagiography would not be fair—not entirely. That said, when she writes of the chancellor being “too busy saving the world” to have much time for strolling in the woods, the expression may be less of a rhetorical flourish than it should. “The Chancellor” is an impressively researched but, in many respects, devotional work—the reflection of a worshipful establishment consensus that will eventually seem absurd.<br />Ms. Merkel is undoubtedly an immensely gifted—and ruthless—politician, but for someone periodically dubbed the “leader of the free world” (a title she disdains), her legacy after 16 years as chancellor of Germany is, actually or potentially, and disconcertingly often, destructive, whether economically, geopolitically, at home or abroad."
