    "body": "WASHINGTON—Much of the debate on Capitol Hill over whether to allow Medicare to directly negotiate with pharmaceutical companies centers on one question: how government intervention would affect drugmakers’ ability to develop new treatments.<br />The proposal is key to Democrats’ larger healthcare, child care, education and climate package. Such a provision is widely popular with the public, and it likely would generate hundreds of billions of dollars in savings for the federal government, which Democrats want to tap to fund expanding other health programs. But it is contentious even among Democratic lawmakers, who must reach near unanimity if they want to pass legislation opposed by all Republicans."
