    "body": "Shoplifters get off easy in California, where stealing goods worth less than $950 is a mere misdemeanor—if the crime is prosecuted at all. Bad actors have taken advantage, and this week Walgreens announced the closure of five San Francisco stores plagued by theft.<br />Walgreens spokesman Phil Caruso says the retailer has hired off-duty police officers to guard its San Francisco stores and is spending 46 times the chain average on security in the city. Yet the San Francisco stores endure theft that’s five times the average."
