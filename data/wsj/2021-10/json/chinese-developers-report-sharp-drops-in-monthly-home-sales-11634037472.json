    "body": "Home sales in China are dropping by a third or more in some cases as curbs on property lending and worries about the financial health of  China Evergrande Group  and other developers are sidelining house buyers.<br />In recent days, numerous big developers have reported lower sales figures for September, with many showing year-over-year declines of more than 20% or 30%. That is a stark drop-off for what is usually one of the strongest months in the year, thanks in part to promotions offered around Chinaâ€™s Oct. 1 National Day holiday."
