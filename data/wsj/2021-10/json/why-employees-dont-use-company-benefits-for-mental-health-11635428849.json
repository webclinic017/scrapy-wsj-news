    "body": "Many companies are expanding their mental-health benefits, but getting employees to take advantage of them can be challenging. Puget Sound Energy is on a mission to change that.<br />Last year, 98% of the utility’s employees watched a 20-minute mental-health training video, and managers were offered a two-hour live mental-health training. The sessions included tips on how to recognize and respond to mental-health issues in themselves and others, information on what mental-health resources the company offers, and personal stories from PSE workers who had experienced mental illness in their own lives."
