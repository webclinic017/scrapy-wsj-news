    "body": "Adam Kirsch writes about many different definitions of heroes, including superheroes, but he doesn’t mention how often the word is used incorrectly in everyday language, especially for athletes (“What Makes an American Hero?” Review, Oct. 2). The word ‘hero’ should be applied only to those who truly are: Those who help others in a time of need at a risk to themselves. People like Marine Sgt. Nicole Gee, who was evacuating people from Kabul, was a true hero. She was killed helping others. We should honor her, the 12 service members who died with her and all the other true heroes by using the word correctly.<br />Elizabeth Bettina Nicolosi"
