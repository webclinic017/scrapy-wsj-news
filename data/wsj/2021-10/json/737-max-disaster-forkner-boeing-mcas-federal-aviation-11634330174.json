    "body": "With the indictment of a former  Boeing  employee in the two 737 MAX crashes that killed 346, have we finally got to the bottom of a colossal industrial screwup? No. As persuasive as the indictment might be, it doesn’t try to persuade that the crashes were caused by Mark Forkner, who served as chief technical pilot for the 737 MAX.<br />The allegation: Mr. Forkner at first inadvertently misled federal aircraft certifiers about the function of a new software system in the MAX known as MCAS, or Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System. A year later, on belatedly discovering that Boeing engineers had altered the system, he failed to inform the Federal Aviation Administration as the plane approached certification despite many opportunities to do so."
