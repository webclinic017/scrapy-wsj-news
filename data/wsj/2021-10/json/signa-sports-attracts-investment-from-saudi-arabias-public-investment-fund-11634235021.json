    "body": "Online retailer Signa Sports United is nearing a deal to raise money from a group of investors including Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund would join Signa’s earlier backers, including Japan’s  SoftBank Group Corp. , and Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co., the people said. It would mark a reunion of sorts for the three investors, who were the cornerstones of SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund, launched in 2016."
