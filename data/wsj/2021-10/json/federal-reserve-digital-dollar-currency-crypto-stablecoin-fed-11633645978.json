    "body": "Alexander William Salter is spot on when he warns of the “Dangers of a Digital Dollar” (op-ed, Oct. 6) to financial privacy and political dissent. Another reason to be skeptical of a government-backed digital currency is that the benefits acknowledged by Mr. Salter, such as faster payments and financial inclusion, are already being achieved by private-sector innovators.<br />Fintech apps such as Dave and Chime offer consumers low-fee banking and free or very low-cost advances on their paychecks. Privately issued “stablecoins” move money quickly between cryptocurrencies and state-backed national currencies. A central-bank digital currency would be duplicative of these innovations and could crowd them out."
