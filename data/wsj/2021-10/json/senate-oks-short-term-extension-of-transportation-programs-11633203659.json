    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The Senate approved a short-term extension of transportation programs Saturday, sending to President Biden stopgap legislation after the House again delayed a vote on a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill.<br />The 30-day extension of the transportation programs effectively creates a new deadline for Democrats to resolve divisions that have held up the $1 trillion infrastructure bill in the House. Mr. Biden on Friday called on House Democrats to hold off on approving the public-works legislation, which passed the Senate this summer with broad bipartisan support, until the party first unifies around a broader social policy and climate proposal."
