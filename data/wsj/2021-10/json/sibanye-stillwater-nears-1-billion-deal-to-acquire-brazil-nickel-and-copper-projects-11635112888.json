    "body": "Sibanye-Stillwater Ltd.  is in advanced talks to buy two Brazilian miners for about $1 billion including debt, people familiar with the matter said, a bet on continued demand for metals used in the production of electric-car batteries.<br />The South Africa-based miner would acquire Atlantic Nickel, which operates the Santa Rita mine, one of the world’s biggest open-pit nickel sulfide mines, and Mineracao Vale Verde, which is developing a copper-and-gold mine, the people said. The deal is expected to be announced in the coming days, assuming it doesn’t fall apart."
