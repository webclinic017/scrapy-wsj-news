    "body": "‘The hellscape that is high school,” as someone describes it in “One of Us Is Lying,” is hardly unexplored territory. Several current shows—“Never Have I Ever” and “Sex Education,” among them—are making comedy gold out of exactly that. Other shows have taken darker paths through the winding corridors of lockers and lust. But the question about “One of Us Is Lying”—part Agatha Christie, part Aaron Spelling—is what, exactly, it’s supposed to be: comedy, drama or something else entirely.<br />Based on the young-adult thriller by Karen M. McManus, the show is a catalog of soap-opera conceits that borrow not just from “Melrose Place” or “Dawson’s Creek” but ’30s radio: At one point, a maudlin confession is accompanied by a tinkly piano in a fashion that suggests “The Guiding Light.” It can’t have been an accident. But neither is the rather gruesome death around which this eight-part series is constructed (three episodes drop Thursday, three on Oct. 14, and the final two on Oct. 21). That is the kind of thing that separates it from its ancestors."
