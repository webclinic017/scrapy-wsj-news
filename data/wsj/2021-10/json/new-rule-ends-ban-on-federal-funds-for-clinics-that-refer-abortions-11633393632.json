    "body": "The Biden administration Monday reversed a Trump-era policy that stripped federal family-planning dollars from clinics that refer patients for abortions.<br />The Department of Health and Human Services finalized a rule that would undo a 2019 policy on a federal program which called for clinics that received federal funding to physically separate their abortion services in a different building from all other services, and not to discuss abortions as an option with patients. The program, known as Title X, offers about $286 million each year to clinics that provide reproductive healthcare and other womenâ€™s health screenings, such as Pap smears, to about four million uninsured Americans a year."
