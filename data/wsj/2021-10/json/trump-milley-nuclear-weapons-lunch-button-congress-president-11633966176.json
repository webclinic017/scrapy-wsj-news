    "body": "Former Defense Secretary William Perry presents a reasoned argument that “One Man Shouldn’t Control the Nuclear Button” (op-ed, Oct. 5). His case for a launch-response policy “that allows for deliberation, including consultation with leaders in Congress,” has its flaws, however, not least of which is actually finding leaders in today’s Congress.<br />Mr. Perry’s justifying a slower collaborative decision with “we have more than enough submarine missiles to respond with devastating force to any attack, even one that wiped out our silos” isn’t as reassuring as intended when he adds: “We can ride out any presumed attack until we are certain it is happening.” Obviously, some—perhaps many—of “we” wouldn’t be riding out that attack."
