    "body": "Deutsche Bank AG’s  businesses did better than expected in the third quarter but higher costs and a continued slowdown in its investment-banking arm weighed on results.<br />Quarterly net profit rose 6% to €329 million, equivalent to $381 million, aided by a decline in provisions for bad loans related to the pandemic. Analysts had forecast a profit of €280 million. Revenue rose 2%, mostly due to a strong performance from the bank’s asset-management business."
