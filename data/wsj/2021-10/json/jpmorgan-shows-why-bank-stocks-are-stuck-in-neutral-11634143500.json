    "body": "If the U.S.’s biggest bank is any indication, lenders are still hunkering down and waiting for economic liftoff.<br />The good news from JPMorgan Chase’s earnings report is that the emergence of the Delta variant of Covid-19 and the crunch of supply chains seen in the third quarter didn’t hit the bank’s strong core. The bank continued to release loan-loss reserves and even further lowered its outlook for net charge-offs of credit-card debt in 2021, to around 2% from around 2.5% earlier in the year."
