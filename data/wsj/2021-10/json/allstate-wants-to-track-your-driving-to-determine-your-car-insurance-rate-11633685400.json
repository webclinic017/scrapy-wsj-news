    "body": "Many consumers are unhappy that car insurers use their credit histories in setting premium rates. Now an alternative is in sightâ€”and some might like it even less. Insurers would be able to track how, when and where they drive.<br />Since late summer, car insurer  Allstate Corp.  has been talking to state regulators about helping to lead an industrywide effort to transition in the coming years from sizing up risk in applicants with factors including credit scores to largely using telematics to determine rates, the company and regulators said."
