    "body": "The deployment of superfast 5G networks is supposed to usher in a new era for so much more than the smartphoneâ€”everything from enhanced virtual-reality videogames to remote heart surgery. That vision has been slow to come into focus, but a first wave of 5G-enabled gadgets is emerging.<br />Among the first uses of 5G to hit the consumer market is the delivery of home broadband internet service for the ultimate cord-cutters: those looking to not just shed their cable-TV bills but abandon Internet access via wires altogether. Samsung Electronics Co., for instance, has teamed up with  Verizon Communications Inc.  to offer wireless 5G routers that promise to deliver at-home broadband access. The router picks up 5G signals just like a smartphone would."
