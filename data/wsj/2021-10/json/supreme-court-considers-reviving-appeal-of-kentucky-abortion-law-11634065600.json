    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Tuesday appeared inclined to revive an appeal of lower-court rulings that struck down a Kentucky antiabortion law as unconstitutional.<br />The legal question was procedural: Whether Kentucky’s Republican attorney general has the right to pursue additional litigation in defense of the statute, which outlaws most second-trimester abortions, following a loss before a federal circuit court that the Democratic governor’s administration declined to appeal further."
