    "body": "The humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia’s Tigray region continues to escalate, with only a fraction of needed aid allowed to enter, the United Nations said hours after the government in Addis Ababa expelled seven of the organization’s officials, accusing them of meddling in the country’s internal affairs.<br />In a report released late Thursday, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said 79% of pregnant or lactating women screened over the past week in Tigray, which has been at war with Ethiopia’s government for almost a year, were suffering from acute malnutrition. Nearly one in five children under the age of 5 were also moderately malnourished, with 2.4% of children severely malnourished, the report said."
