    "body": "Surging energy costs have spread fear among investors in recent weeks that inflation isnâ€™t going away. One place where the strains are being felt most acutely is the U.K., where bond markets have exhibited some wild moves.<br />The most dramatic swings took place with government bonds whose coupons are linked to inflation. Those bonds, and derivatives known as swaps, are seen as a measure of where investors believe inflation is headed. Yields on them surged to their highest levels in over a decade."
