    "body": "LONDON— AstraZeneca  PLC said Tuesday it has asked U.S. regulators for emergency-use authorization for an antibody drug that earlier this year showed strong efficacy in preventing symptomatic Covid-19, offering a potential alternative in evading the disease.<br />AstraZeneca said in August that it would aim the antibody combination, called AZD7442 and delivered as a shot, at preventing Covid-19 symptoms, like a vaccine. The primary use, AstraZeneca said, would be for a minority of people with chronic diseases and other conditions that could render vaccines less effective. Emergency-use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, if granted, would make the long-acting antibody cocktail a first-of-its kind preventive option."
