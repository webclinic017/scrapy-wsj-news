    "body": "Regarding “New Delhi Says Tata to Nationalization” (Sadanand Dhume, East Is East, Oct. 14): Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is embarking on the most transformative supply-side, free-market reforms in a generation. The Modi government is not only privatizing state-owned enterprises but also overhauling taxes, relaxing foreign direct investment (FDI) rules and deregulating labor and agriculture markets.<br />The Indian Parliament recently voted to abolish retroactive taxation, giving foreign investors a favorable, predictable climate for capital accumulation. Investors received additional succor when the FDI caps in the insurance and telecom sectors were lifted. With labor reforms, India’s notoriously strident unions have been chastened; they must now issue two-months notice before striking, and firms need fewer approvals from the government for redeploying labor. Thanks to agriculture liberalization, Indian farmers are free to engage in contract farming and can sell directly to private buyers instead of through government-controlled stockyards. India further reduced the cost of doing business by cutting corporate tax rates to 15% from 25% for start-ups, and to 22% from 30% for established companies."
