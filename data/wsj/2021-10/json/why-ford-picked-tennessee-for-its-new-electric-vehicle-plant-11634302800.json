    "body": "Tennessee is emerging as a leader in a national scramble to develop electric-vehicle and battery production, as states compete to woo multibillion-dollar investments from auto companies pivoting away from the combustion engine.<br />Ford Motor Co.  and South Korean battery maker  SK Innovation  recently said they plan to develop a large complex to make electric vehicles and batteries in West Tennessee.
