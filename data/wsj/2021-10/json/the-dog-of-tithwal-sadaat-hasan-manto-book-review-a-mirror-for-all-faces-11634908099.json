    "body": "‘Every situation has its own music,” the narrator tells us in Saadat Hasan Manto’s story “Mummy.” During his brief life—he died in 1955, from the effects of chronic alcoholism, at age 42—Manto found the right notes for a huge variety of human dramas. The Urdu-language author published more than 20 collections of short stories. He also wrote screenplays for the Bombay film industry, radio plays and a ceaseless flow of journalism. Frequently peopled by pimps, prostitutes, hoodlums, gamblers and hard-drinking bohemians (like their creator), his fictional dispatches from the seamy side of midcentury South Asian societies saw him prosecuted for obscenity six times: three cases under the Raj in British India, three in newly independent Pakistan. Anti-Muslim rioting in Bombay, the city he loved and chronicled, prompted his family to move north to Lahore after the Partition of India in 1947.<br />An endlessly fertile storyteller, Manto charmed even his accusers. He once befriended the Pakistani judge who had just fined him for a scandalous tale. “Society itself is obscene,” he told the judge. “All I do is represent its essence. It is entirely understandable that people with ugly faces vent their anger at the mirror.”"
