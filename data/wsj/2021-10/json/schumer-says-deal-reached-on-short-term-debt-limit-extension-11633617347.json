    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The Senate was set to vote on a deal to extend the debt ceiling through early December and avert a looming government default, over the complaints of some GOP lawmakers who cast the agreement struck by party leaders as a capitulation to Democrats.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) announced he was accepting the offer from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) on Thursday morning, and later scheduled votes for the evening after both leaders briefed their caucuses. The Senate would first need to clear a 60-vote procedural hurdle before proceeding to final passage of the measure."
