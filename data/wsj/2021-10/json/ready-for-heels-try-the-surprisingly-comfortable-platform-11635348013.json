    "body": "JULIA HAART contends that more people have seen her naked than without her platform heels. Indeed, if you google Ms. Haart—CEO of talent media company Elite World Group and star of the Netflix reality series “My Unorthodox Life,” which chronicles the glam lifestyle she built after leaving an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community—you’d be hard-pressed to find a photo of the 5-foot-tall New Yorker without her prodigious platforms. She says they lend her “courage and confidence” whether she’s in the office or in labor—yes, labor. Ms. Haart insisted upon wearing 5-inch Christian Louboutin platforms during the birth of her son when doctors had to induce labor 12 weeks early. “It was frightening and I was going to keep my shoes on…I felt like that was control.”<br />Few women can relate to platformed parturition, but most understand Ms. Haart’s quest for comfort. “I wear my shoes 14 hours a day. They don’t bother my feet,” she said. “Women should never have to choose between comfort and beauty. Platforms are a happy solution.”"
