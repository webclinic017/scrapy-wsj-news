    "body": "The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday authorized a tobacco-flavored e-cigarette made by tobacco giant Reynolds American Inc. and rejected several sweet or fruit-flavored refill cartridges the company wanted to bring back on the market.<br />The decision signals the hard line the agency is taking on sweet and fruity e-cigarette flavors in a broad review it is conducting to determine which vaping products may remain on the U.S. market. Reynolds’ Vuse Solo vaporizer and its tobacco-flavored refill cartridges are the first products to receive authorization as part of the review."
