    "body": "Aleph Holding has confidentially filed for an initial public offering in the U.S., according to people familiar with the matter, paving the way for the digital-advertising company to go public in early 2022.<br />The filing comes shortly after  MercadoLibre Inc.,  the dominant e-commerce company in Latin America, invested $25 million in Aleph at a $2 billion valuation. In preparation for its IPO, Aleph has been building out its board of directors. MercadoLibreâ€™s chief financial officer Pedro Arnt recently agreed to join the board, as has Imran Khan, former chief strategy officer of Snap Inc. and the chief executive officer and co-founder of online e-commerce platform Verishop Inc., as chairman."
