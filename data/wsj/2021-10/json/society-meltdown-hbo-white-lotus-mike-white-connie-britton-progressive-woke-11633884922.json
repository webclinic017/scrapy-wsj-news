    "body": "The best writer in Hollywood right now is Mike White. In 2003 he wrote the film “School of Rock” for his friend Jack Black to star in. After a stretch competing in reality shows like “The Amazing Race” and “Survivor,” Mr. White is back where he belongs. He created, wrote and directed the recent HBO series “The White Lotus.” Set in Hawaii, it chronicles the dysfunction and competing narratives of staff and guests at a luxury resort. It is funny, biting and eye-opening. Mr. White so perfectly dissects society’s mental meltdown, I’m worried he might end up canceled.<br />Mr. White really shines when writing about the Mossbacher family. The mom, Nicole (Connie Britton), is chief financial officer of a search company. The dad, Mark (Steve Zahn), has health issues, and their daughter, Olivia (Sydney Sweeney), and a friend are pitch-perfect judgy college sophomores, dreaming of utopia while dripping in mockery and ridicule. The dinner conversations are priceless."
