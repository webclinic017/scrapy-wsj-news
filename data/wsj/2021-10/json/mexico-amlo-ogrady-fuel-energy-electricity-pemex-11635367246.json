    "body": "Like others before her, Mary Anastasia O’Grady believes there will be a conflict between Mexico and the U.S. over the constitutional reform bill on electricity that President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has put forward (“Mexico Moves to Seize American Assets,” Americas, Oct. 18). Nothing could be further from the truth: Mexico’s relationship with the U.S. is an excellent one at this time. We are updating our mechanisms of cooperation in various areas to reflect the enormous complexity of the relations between our two countries, as both partners and neighbors.<br />The electricity reform bill now being debated in Congress seeks to satisfy the basic supply needs of all Mexicans. Therefore, the bill reserves 54% of the market for the Federal Electricity Commission, with the private sector able to operate in the other 46%. Contrary to the column’s headline, the bill provides for the participation of private companies in the sector, and active contracts will be reviewed in accordance with the law."
