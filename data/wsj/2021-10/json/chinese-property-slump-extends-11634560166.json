    "body": "China’s giant housing market slowed substantially in September, official data showed, as the country’s debt-saddled developers cut spending and demand from home buyers waned.<br />Monday’s data builds on recent reports from individual real-estate companies showing punishing drops in sales. It also underscores how property-market weakness, already evident in lackluster August figures, hasn’t abated as the industry enters what is traditionally a much stronger period for home sales."
