    "body": "Musicians who distribute their work on streaming platforms typically wait weeks to get paid for the traffic they generate. Paperchain Inc., a startup that just raised pre-seed money, says it has a way to get that down to a few days and produce a steady stream of income for musicians.<br />The New York-based startup uses loans from decentralized finance, or DeFi, and estimates what an artistâ€™s daily streaming traffic is worth in order to fast-track payments."
