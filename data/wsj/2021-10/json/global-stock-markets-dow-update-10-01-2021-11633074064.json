    "body": "Stock futures declined Friday, putting the S&P 500 on track for its worst week in almost a year, as investors weighed the prospect of a spell of higher inflation and slower economic growth.<br />Futures for the S&P 500 fell 0.5%, after the broad stocks index closed out its biggest monthly loss since March last year. The S&P has fallen 3.3% so far this week, which would be its biggest decline since a 5.6% drop in late October 2020."
