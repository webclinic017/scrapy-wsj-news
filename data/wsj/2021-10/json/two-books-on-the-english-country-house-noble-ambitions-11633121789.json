    "body": "In 1974 the Victoria and Albert Museum held an exhibition called “The Destruction of the Country House.” The director, Roy Strong, noticed that visitors were in tears as they came to terms with all that had disappeared—well over a thousand grand houses had been demolished since the 1870s. In the exhibition catalog, the National Trust expert James Lees-Milne opened his essay by calling the country house “as archaic as the osprey,” a bird of prey extinct in England since 1840.<br />Two very different but equally compelling new books by major British architectural historians strike a note of optimism. Clive Aslet’s “The Story of the Country House: A History of Places and People” is an eclectic scholarly account, tracing the evolution of the country house from the hunting lodges of the Middle Ages to the modern villas of today. Adrian Tinniswood’s erudite and delightfully gossipy “Noble Ambitions: The Fall and Rise of the English Country House After World War II” examines changes in the status of the great houses in postwar Britain, old versus new money, and social upheavals."
