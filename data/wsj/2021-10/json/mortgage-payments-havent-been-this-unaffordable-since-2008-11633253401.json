    "body": "House prices are rising at a record pace but incomes arenâ€™t keeping up, which is making home ownership less and less affordable.<br />The median American household would need 32.1% of its income to cover mortgage payments on a median-priced home, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. That is the most since November 2008, when the same outlays would eat up 34.2% of income."
