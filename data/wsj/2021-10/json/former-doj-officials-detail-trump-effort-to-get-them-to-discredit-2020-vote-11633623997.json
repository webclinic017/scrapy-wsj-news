    "body": "WASHINGTON—Former acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen told congressional investigators he believed then-President Donald Trump’s unwillingness to accept the results of the 2020 election was misguided and that he would have “strongly preferred if he had chosen a different focus in the last month of his presidency,” according to testimony made public Thursday.<br />“I disagreed with things that President Trump suggested the Justice Department do with regard to the election, so we did not do them,” Mr. Rosen told the Senate Judiciary Committee in August in his first extended remarks about the episode, as the panel was investigating Mr. Trump’s efforts to pressure the Justice Department to investigate his baseless claims of election fraud during his final weeks in office."
