    "body": "Seniors and other Americans receiving Social Security benefits in 2022 are likely to see the largest increase in their payments in decades, reflecting surging inflation during the pandemic.<br />The Social Security Administration on Wednesday is scheduled to release its annual cost-of-living adjustment for the benefits. Analysts expect the adjustment to be a roughly 6% boost, which would translate to an addition of nearly $93 to retireesâ€™ current average monthly benefit of $1,543."
