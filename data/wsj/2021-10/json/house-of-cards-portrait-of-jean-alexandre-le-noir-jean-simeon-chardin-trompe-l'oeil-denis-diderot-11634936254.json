    "body": "Jean-Siméon Chardin’s enchanting “The House of Cards (Portrait of Jean-Alexandre Le Noir)” is the current subject of the National Gallery Masterpiece Tour, that London museum’s annual traveling program designed to engage diverse new audiences at smaller institutions across Britain. The circa 1740-41 painting, one of the French artist’s four autograph variations on this genre theme, has evoked recent speculation as to its meaning and place in his career.<br />Chardin’s canvas, probably exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1741, was likely commissioned by Jean-Jacques Le Noir, a cabinet maker and close friend who ordered several family portraits, including, presumably, this one of his young son, shown in profile and leaning slightly over a small wooden table. The table, covered with bright green baize, holds a gambling chip and coin, crisply folded playing cards, and the precariously constructed title subject."
