    "body": "WASHINGTON—A bipartisan group of senators said that they were “extremely alarmed” by the growing reports of cases of the mysterious neurological ailment known as Havana Syndrome, and questioned whether the State Department and other Biden administration agencies were treating the crisis with the attention necessary.<br />The letter, addressed to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and cosigned by several of the administration’s closest Senate allies, also called upon the administration to appoint someone to lead the State Department’s Havana Syndrome task force; the previous director, Ambassador Pamela Spratlen, departed last month after six months on the job."
