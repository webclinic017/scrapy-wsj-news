    "body": "Just before midnight on Nov. 25, 1120, the White Ship left the northern French harbor of Barfleur, bound for the English port of Southampton. On board the stately vessel were nearly 300 passengers, including the aristocratic elite of the prosperous Anglo-Norman realm then ruled by Henry I. Foremost among them, and the focus of Henry’s dynastic hopes, was his sole legitimate son and heir, the 17-year-old William Ætheling.<br />Warmed by several barrels of wine, the White Ship’s boisterous company anticipated a swift and uneventful crossing of the English Channel. But the crew and helmsman were also tipsy, and the voyage had barely begun before it ended in catastrophe. Just a mile offshore, the White Ship struck the notorious Quilleboeuf rock, keeled over and foundered in the frigid sea. There was only one survivor, the humble butcher Berold. As the White Ship went down, Berold testified, William Ætheling’s bodyguard hustled him aboard the lone rowboat. But when he heard the anguished cries of his half-sister, Matilda of Perche, the prince insisted upon turning back, and the dinghy was swamped and sunk."
