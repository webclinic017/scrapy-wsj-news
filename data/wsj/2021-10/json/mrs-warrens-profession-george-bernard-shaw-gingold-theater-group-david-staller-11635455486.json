    "body": "New York<br />Time was when George Bernard Shaw’s effervescent comedies of ideas were seen on Broadway with fair regularity, but those days are long past. All the more reason, then, to praise David Staller, the artistic director of Project Shaw, a long-running series of semi-staged concert readings of the playwright’s 60-odd shows. In addition to Project Shaw, Mr. Staller’s Gingold Theatrical Group presented fully staged small-scale off-Broadway versions of “Heartbreak House” in 2018 and “Caesar and Cleopatra” in 2019, and now they’re doing “Mrs. Warren’s Profession,” which hasn’t been seen anywhere in New York since the Roundabout Theatre Company mounted it 11 years ago. The production is completely satisfying, and the play gains immeasurably from up-close presentation (it is being performed in one of Theatre Row’s six 88-seat houses)."
