    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court returns to its courtroom Monday for its first in-person arguments since March 2020, opening a term featuring challenges to abortion rights, gun regulations and a secular public school system.<br />Like other workplaces returning to life after coronavirus-driven closings, things will be different. Only staff members, attorneys and accredited journalists may enter the courthouse, while the public for the first time can listen live through a link on the court’s website. Attorneys are directed to wear N-95 or KN-95 masks within the courtroom “except when presenting argument,” but only those with negative Covid-19 tests are allowed in."
