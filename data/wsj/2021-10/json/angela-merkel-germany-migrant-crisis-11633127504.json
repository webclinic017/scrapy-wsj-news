    "body": "Regarding “Merkel Says Auf Wiedersehen to a Diminished Europe” (Review, Sept. 25): I disagree with the characterization of Angela Merkel as a risk-averse and tepid leader who had no grand vision for Germany. Clearly her compassion was visionary and courageous. The essay says that in 2015 her government declined to close Germany’s border because of “fear that border police might have to use violence to keep people out.” How visionary and compassionate such a decision looks when compared with the images we saw recently from Del Rio, Texas, and the images we have seen at America’s southern border for years. To pretend the problem doesn’t exist and then express surprise when people, under extreme stress, resort to violence, as our government did, seems cowardly in comparison.<br />I know of no other leader, save perhaps Pope Francis, who has demonstrated by his or her actions, not mere rhetoric, the values that Americans are supposed to hold dear, namely, that “all men are created equal.” I wish that the world had more leaders with the courage to demonstrate compassion and accept all people as equal. I fear we won’t see her likes again."
