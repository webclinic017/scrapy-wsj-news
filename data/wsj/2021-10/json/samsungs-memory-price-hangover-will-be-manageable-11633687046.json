    "body": "Memory-chip companies rode the Covid-19 wave to record highs. Now that wave has crested and companies will need to figure out how to navigate the trough.  Samsung  Electronics, with its diversified businesses and market leadership, may weather it better than most.<br />Memory-chip stocks have retreated substantially from their peaks earlier this year. Samsung is down 21% since January, while  SK Hynix  is 37% lower than its February peak. Both are still reporting stellar results: Samsung said Friday that its revenue for last quarter could reach a record of the equivalent of $61 billion, while its operating profit would be the highest in three years."
