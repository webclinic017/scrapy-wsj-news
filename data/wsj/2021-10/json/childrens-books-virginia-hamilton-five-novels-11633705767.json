    "body": "When Virginia Hamilton was 9, she began filling a notebook with what she would later describe as “an accumulation of mysteries” gleaned from the oblique and coded conversation of adults. “What a wealth of grown-up talk graced its pages,” she would recall. “What monstrous, wonderful, snide and vindictive secrets!” Her plan was to return to her notes when she was old enough to understand them. Alas, she mislaid the notebook and never did discover what scintillating revelations it contained.<br />The story of the notebook helps explain why Hamilton (1936-2002) became one of the 20th century’s most celebrated writers of children’s books. She was an observer, a listener, and someone intensely alive to the currents of feeling and meaning moving around her. That 9-year-old note-taker became an 11-year-old novelist filling, as she put it later, “page after page with vehement prose under the hot summer sun while lying on a slant atop the burning tin roof of the hog barn” in small-town Ohio. She would eventually publish 41 children’s books and become the first black writer to win the Newbery Medal."
