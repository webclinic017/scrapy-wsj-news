    "body": "It is tempting to wave away what is happening with inflation as “pandemic-related,” and therefore bound to pass. But doing so would somehow miss the point. Isn’t everything pandemic-related these days? And is the pandemic something we can wave away?<br />The Labor Department on Wednesday reported that U.S. consumer prices rose 0.4% in September, putting them 5.4% above their year-earlier level. A portion of that gain came from a sharp rise in gasoline prices and higher food costs. Prices excluding food and energy items, which economists watch to get a better sense of inflation’s trend, were up 4%. It isn’t much solace when you are filling up the tank or at the grocery store, but given how volatile fuel prices in particular can be, it makes some sense."
