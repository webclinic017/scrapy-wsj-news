    "body": "When the Illinois Democratic Legislature put forward congressional maps this month, even the  New York Times  said the House seats “would be among the most gerrymandered in the country.” With three of 17 seats leaning GOP (compared to five of 18 today), the Princeton Gerrymandering Project gave the map an “F” for partisan fairness.<br />Springfield Democrats have heard this criticism—and decided that their first map wasn’t gerrymandered enough. This week the Legislature is debating revised district lines that would deepen the Democratic advantage."
