    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration kicked off its trade-policy engagement with China late Friday with a virtual meeting between U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He.<br />In the meeting, Ms. Tai raised a range of concerns including what the U.S. says have been China’s “state-led, nonmarket policies and practices” and its failure to live up to the commitments it made under the 2020 phase one trade pact signed with the Trump administration, according to senior administration officials."
