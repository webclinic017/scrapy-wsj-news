    "body": "Editor’s note: Following Steve Jobs’s death on October 5, 2011, Jony Ive delivered a eulogy in which he referred to the chairman and co-founder of Apple as “my closest and my most loyal friend.” Ive, who later left his post as chief design officer at Apple and went on to launch the creative collective LoveFrom, wrote this remembrance in which he reflects on his memories of Jobs’s last day, the spirit of their collaboration, his friendship with Jobs’s wife, Laurene Powell Jobs, and why his late friend continues to “evade a simple place in my memory.”<br />I have barely thought about Steve’s death."
