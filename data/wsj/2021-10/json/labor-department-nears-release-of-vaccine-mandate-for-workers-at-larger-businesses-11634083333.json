    "body": "The Labor Department took the next step Tuesday to implement President Biden’s plan to require private-sector workers to be vaccinated against Covid-19 or be regularly tested, a move that has drawn a mixed reaction from larger and smaller companies.<br />The proposed mandate would apply to businesses with 100 or more employees, the Labor Department said, confirming early statements. It would be implemented under a federal rule-making known as an emergency temporary standard and affect roughly 80 million workers nationwide, according to Biden administration estimates, or more than half the total U.S. workforce."
