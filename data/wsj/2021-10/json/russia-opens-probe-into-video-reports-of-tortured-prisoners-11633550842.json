    "body": "MOSCOW—Russian law enforcement opened criminal investigations into reports of widespread prisoner abuse and several officials in the penitentiary system were fired in cases that human-rights advocates say point to systematic torture in prisons across the country.<br />The probes come after prison activist group Gulagu.net posted footage it says depicts abuse, humiliation and beatings in prison facilities, part of a trove of more than 1,000 videos that the organization has been leaked. The Wall Street Journal couldn’t independently confirm the veracity of the videos."
