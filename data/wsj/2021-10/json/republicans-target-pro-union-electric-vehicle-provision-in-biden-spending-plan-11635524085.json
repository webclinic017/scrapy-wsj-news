    "body": "WASHINGTON—Republicans are expected to ask the Senate parliamentarian to strip from Democrats’ social spending and climate legislation a provision giving special tax incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles made with union labor.<br />President Biden’s signature domestic legislation would provide a tax credit of as much as $12,500 for the purchase of a new electric vehicle, with $4,500 of that available only for cars, vans, SUVs and pickups made at unionized factories. Written by Michigan’s Democratic lawmakers, the provision would accrue to vehicles made by  General Motors Co. ,  Ford Motor Co.  and  Stellantis  NV, which have plants in the state and whose U.S. manufacturing workers are represented by the United Auto Workers."
