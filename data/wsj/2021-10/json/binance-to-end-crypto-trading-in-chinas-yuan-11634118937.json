    "body": "The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange said it would stop allowing trading involving the Chinese currency on its consumer-to-consumer platform, weeks after China made its strongest move yet against the use of digital assets.<br />Binance, which was founded in 2017 and initially based in China, said Wednesday that it would remove the option to buy or sell cryptocurrencies using the yuan in peer-to-peer trading after this year. From that point, any users found to be based in mainland China would be allowed only to withdraw or close their positions, the exchange added."
