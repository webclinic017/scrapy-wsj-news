    "body": "The Biden administration is preparing by mid-November to resume a Trump-era immigration policy of returning migrants to Mexico while their requests for asylum in the U.S. are considered, administration officials said, in a last-minute step to comply with a federal court order.<br />The policy, known as Remain in Mexico, was introduced by former President Donald Trump in 2019 at the height of a surge in Central American families coming to the U.S. border. As a presidential candidate, Mr. Biden called it dangerous and inhumane and ended its use on his first day in office."
