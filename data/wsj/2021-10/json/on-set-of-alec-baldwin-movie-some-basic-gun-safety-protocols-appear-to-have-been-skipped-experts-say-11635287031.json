    "body": "SANTA FE, N.M.—The account of the fatal shooting on the movie set of “Rust” in affidavits prepared by the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office suggests that some industry-standard safety precautions weren’t followed, say film-weapons experts and industry veterans.<br />Hannah Gutierrez Reed, the movie’s 24-year-old firearms expert, who had recently completed her first film as head armorer, wasn’t the person who handed the gun that was fired to actor Alec Baldwin, according to the affidavits. That deviates from standard practice, say other armorers and film-industry veterans."
