    "body": "It is an interesting wrinkle of our times that the suffocating enforced conformity should come from below rather than above (“The Tyranny of the 21st-Century Crowd” by Robert D. Kaplan, op-ed, Oct. 8), but someone will have to administer this horrid state of affairs. The totalitarian literature has been remarkably prescient about many aspects of this, but it may be time to dust off an overlooked classic: former Yugoslavian dissident Milovan Djilas’s “The New Class” (1957).<br />The book was urged on me by my father, himself a refugee from the Soviet Union, during my early 20s flirtation with socialist ideology. It accurately describes how a new privileged and ultimately unaccountable group of functionaries administers the new rules for everybody while pointedly excluding itself. Exhibit A may be the manner in which those who are most fervently pushing all the Covid rules and regulations tend to exempt themselves from these restrictions when they become inconvenient."
