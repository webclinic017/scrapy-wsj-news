    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y) set up a vote for next week on revised elections legislation, starting off a busy session with a measure that has unified the Democratic caucus but drawn Republican opposition in the 50-50 chamber.<br />The Freedom to Vote Act, which was introduced last month, is the product of months of negotiations between senators including Rules Committee Chairwoman Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) The sweeping measure would require at least 15 consecutive days of early voting in every state, mandate same-day registration at all polling sites by 2024, and make permanent the mail-in voting that was introduced in 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic struck, among other measures."
