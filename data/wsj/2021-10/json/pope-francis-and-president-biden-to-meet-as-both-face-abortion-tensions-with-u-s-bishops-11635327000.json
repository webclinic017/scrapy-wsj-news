    "body": "ROME—President Biden will meet Pope Francis on Friday for the first time during his administration, as both face contentious relationships with U.S. Catholic Church leaders over the issue of abortion.<br />The Vatican visit by the second Catholic president in American history will come a little more than two weeks before U.S. bishops, meeting in Baltimore, are expected to debate whether Catholic politicians who support abortion rights, such as Mr. Biden, should be denied Communion. In June, 168 bishops out of 229 voted to draft a statement that would address the question, within a longer document on the importance of the Eucharist."
