    "body": "Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis lost his re-election bid on Saturday, a major upset against a billionaire businessman who had personified the rise of populist nationalism in Central Europe.<br />With 99.9 percent of ballots counted, Mr. Babis’s Yes party held 27.2 % of the vote, trailing less than a percentage point behind a coalition of right-leaning parties called Together. Along with a separate, liberal alliance of parties called Pirates and Mayors, the two coalitions appeared to hold 108 of parliament’s 200 seats, according to Czech Television, the national public broadcaster."
