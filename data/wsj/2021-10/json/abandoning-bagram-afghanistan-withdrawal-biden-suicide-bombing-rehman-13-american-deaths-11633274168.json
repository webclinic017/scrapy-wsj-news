    "body": "Congress learned more last week about the decisions surrounding the Biden administration’s disgraceful withdrawal from Afghanistan. One fact that is becoming clear: The decision to abandon Bagram Air Field is directly connected to the deaths of 13 U.S. service members, one of whom, Marine Lance Cpl. Kareem Nikoui, was my constituent.<br />President Biden ordered all U.S. troops to leave after 20 years in the country, forcing military commanders to abandon Bagram, which they did in July by shutting off the electricity and slipping away in the middle of the night without notifying the base’s new Afghan commander. This cowardly act led to looting, and the Taliban seized Bagram a month later."
