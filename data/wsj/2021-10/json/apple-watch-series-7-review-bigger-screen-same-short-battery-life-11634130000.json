    "body": "To put it plainly: The  Apple  Watch Series 7 is slightly better than its predecessor. There aren’t any new health sensors. The price hasn’t dropped. And at 18 hours, the watch’s daylong battery life is still relatively short.<br />The most significant update to the new smartwatch, arriving on Friday, is a slightly larger touch screen, which can fit more text from messages and features bigger, easier-to-press buttons. The watch is also more rugged, according to Apple."
