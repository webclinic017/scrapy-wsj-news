    "body": "If President Biden wants to understand why his $3.5 trillion entitlement spending plan is stalled in Congress, he might look at the new poll from Gallup. Asked whether government should do more or less to solve the country’s problems, 52% of Americans said government is doing too much.<br />This is a reversal from last year when the Gallup headline was: “New High 54% Want Government to Solve More Problems in U.S.” That was a blip. The only other time over Gallup’s 29 years of asking this question that at least half of Americans wanted more active government was after the 9/11 terror attacks."
