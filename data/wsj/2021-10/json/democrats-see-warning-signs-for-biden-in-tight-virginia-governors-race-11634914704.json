    "body": "FAIRFAX, Va.—A tightening governor’s race in Virginia is stirring concerns among Democrats who see the contest as a barometer for President Biden’s political fortunes as he struggles to pass an ambitious agenda and prepares to try to maintain his party’s control in Congress.<br />Democrat Terry McAuliffe is trying to buck a historical trend in which the president’s party has struggled in his state’s gubernatorial races, even as Americans grapple with the pandemic, higher energy prices and supply-chain backups. People close to the White House have expressed worries about whether the former Virginia governor, who is making a comeback bid, can defeat Republican Glenn Youngkin in the Nov. 2 election."
