    "body": "You can’t buy what you can’t get. That, in short, was the story for the U.S. economy in the third quarter.<br />The Commerce Department on Thursday reported that gross domestic product grew at an inflation-adjusted 2% annual rate in the third quarter over the previous quarter, slowing from a 6.7% pace in the second quarter and below the 2.8% economists had penciled in. The details of the report plainly showed it was largely a lack of supply, rather than a waning of demand, that led to the slowdown."
