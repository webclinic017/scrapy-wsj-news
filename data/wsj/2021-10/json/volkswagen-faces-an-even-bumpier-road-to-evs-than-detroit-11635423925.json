    "body": "Volkswagen  has a way of making investors feel every jolt on its path to electric vehicles.<br />The German automotive giant reported third-quarter profits Thursday that included losses for what it calls its “volume” brands, notably the VW badge itself. Like General Motors, it was more affected by chip shortages during the latest quarter than in the first half, but unlike GM and other big peers, it doesn’t have high enough margins or flexible enough costs to cope well with a drop-off in car production."
