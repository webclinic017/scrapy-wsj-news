    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Border Patrol made about 1.66 million arrests of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally in the 2021 fiscal year, the highest annual number ever recorded, according to figures released Friday  by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.<br />The pace of migrants coming across the border has emerged as one of the most difficult issues for the Biden administration to tackle, posing a broad set of logistical challenges and providing fodder for Republicans who say President Biden’s immigration policies provoked the surge."
