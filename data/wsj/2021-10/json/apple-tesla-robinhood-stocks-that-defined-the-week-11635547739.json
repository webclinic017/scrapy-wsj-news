    "body": "Apple Inc.<br />Even the biggest winners of the pandemic era are getting squeezed by a tight labor market and supply-chain woes. Apple reported a record 12-month profit nearing $100 billion on Thursday, but noted that supply constraints continue to hinder the manufacture of iPhone and other products during the important holiday-shopping quarter.  Amazon.com Inc.  posted lower-than-expected third-quarter sales and signaled that labor and supply issues would weigh on fourth-quarter earnings. Apple shares fell 1.8% Friday, while Amazon shares ended 2.2% lower."
