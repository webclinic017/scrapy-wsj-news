    "body": "High-speed trading firms are paying brokers billions of dollars a year to execute options orders, leading them to promote the risky trades whose popularity has boomed among small investors.<br />The practice, called payment for order flow, has made options a cash cow for brokerages such as  Robinhood Markets Inc.  and TD Ameritrade. They can make twice as much or more from selling customersâ€™ options orders as they do from selling order flow for stocks."
