    "body": "New York<br />The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers was one of the biggest and most shocking business-related news stories since the Great Depression. How could a 161-year-old firm, the fourth-largest investment bank in the U.S., have gone bust, thereby triggering a global financial crisis? Not at all surprisingly, its failure soon became the subject of “Too Big to Fail,” a 2011 made-for-TV movie directed by Curtis Hanson, and now the rise and fall of Lehman Brothers has come to Broadway as well—but not as a by-the-numbers docudrama. Instead, Stefano Massini’s “The Lehman Trilogy,” first performed in Italian in 2015 and translated and adapted by Ben Power for London’s National Theatre three years later, is a three-act free-verse dramatic poem."
