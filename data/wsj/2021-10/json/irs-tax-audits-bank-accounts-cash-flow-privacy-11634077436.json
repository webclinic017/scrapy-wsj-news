    "body": "Regarding “The IRS Gets Window Dressed” (Review & Outlook, Oct. 8): It doesn’t matter whether the threshold amount for pre-emptive Internal Revenue Service snooping is $600, $10,000 or any other amount of cash flow. In our constitutional republic, the presumption of innocence and due process are basic tenets.<br />The Fourth Amendment is clear: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” For the all-powerful IRS to cast a population-wide fishing net in the hopes of catching a few “guilty” individuals spits in the face of due process and the presumption of innocence."
