    "body": "State-imposed bans on Covid-19 vaccine mandates have set up a potential legal clash with the federal government as the Biden administration rolls out a requirement that large companies make sure their employees get inoculated.<br />In Texas and Montana, employers are scrambling to understand the consequences of state orders restricting employers from requiring their workers to be vaccinated against Covid-19. At the same time, they are awaiting rules from the federal government that will mandate shots for millions of American workers—an order from President Biden that is also likely to face lawsuits, casting more uncertainty over the final outcome."
