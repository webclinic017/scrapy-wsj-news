    "body": "The former  Boeing Co.  employee charged with misleading air-safety regulators about a flight-control system that played a significant role in two deadly 737 MAX crashes is being unfairly blamed for the disasters, his attorney said.<br />Mark Forkner, a former chief technical pilot for the 737 MAX program at Boeing, pleaded not guilty to fraud charges on Friday in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas. Prosecutors had been investigating Mr. Forknerâ€™s conduct before the crashes for at least a year, and Boeing itself agreed to pay $2.5 billion to resolve a criminal investigation alleging that its employees conspired to deceive the Federal Aviation Administration."
