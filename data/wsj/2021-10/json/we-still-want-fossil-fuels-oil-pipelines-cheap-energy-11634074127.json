    "body": "The price mechanism is laboring heroically to balance supply and demand and resolve passing energy disruptions caused by the stop-start Covid economy. There are many things politicians do that don’t help, such as blocking pipeline infrastructure or trying to freeze pump prices and electricity rates for end-users. But don’t worry, all will be well because Saudi Arabia, Russia and U.S. wildcatters still like money.<br />In Glasgow, where world leaders will gather soon for a climate conference, they might use the moment to ask some big-boy questions. Was it ever plausible that human beings might dramatically reduce their use of fossil fuels? Doesn’t it seem especially unlikely in a month when leaders have been throwing their climate promises to the wind in pursuit of lower energy prices for their consumers and voters?"
