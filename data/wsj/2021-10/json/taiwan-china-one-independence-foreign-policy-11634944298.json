    "body": "Regarding John Bolton’s op-ed “It’ll Take More Than American Military Might to Shore Up Taiwan” (Oct. 21): The world has changed in the past 30 years and the Covid pandemic is the last straw. Countries around the world—not only in the Indo-Pacific but also Canada, Britain, Lithuania and Poland, as well as the U.S.—are altering their previous and more politic economic-focused view of China’s “wolf-warrior diplomacy.”<br />China’s treatment of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, its crackdown on protesters in Hong Kong, its policies toward Tibet and military threats against Taiwan have faced growing international criticism. Taiwanese people are ready to join the trend of not standing in the middle of the road between the world and China.
