    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The chairman of the House Select Committee investigating the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol said Thursday that the panel would move to hold former Trump adviser Steve Bannon in criminal contempt of Congress, after he declined to comply with a subpoena.<br />The panel plans a vote next Tuesday. The full House, where Democrats hold a slim majority, would also have to vote to certify the contempt charge, which could result in a fine and a jail term of up to 12 months. The Justice Department would still need to sign off and present its case to a grand jury. In addition, Mr. Bannon would have the opportunity to defend himself in a trial."
