    "body": "WASHINGTON—Choosing which Americans should be eligible for benefits in a proposed expansion of the social-safety net is one of the main challenges vexing Democrats, who are attempting to slim down their healthcare, education, child-care and climate bill in the coming weeks.<br />The debate over whether to provide the benefits to low-income Americans only or a broader swath of the public comes as Democrats work to unite their progressives and centrist wings around a revised package. So-called means-testing is one of several methods Democrats are considering for reducing the price tag of the $3.5 trillion proposal, along with potentially dropping some programs altogether or reducing the number of years funded."
