    "body": "HBSC’s pivot to Asia remains promising despite China’s slowing growth and real-estate market uncertainty.<br />On Monday, the London-headquartered bank reported higher-than-expected third-quarter profits and a $2 billion buyback. Midway through its three-year turnaround plan, the bank remains committed to shifting away from the U.S. and Europe toward higher growth markets in Asia. The region already generates a little over half its revenue and profit."
