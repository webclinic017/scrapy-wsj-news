    "body": "SYDNEY—Australia formally adopted a plan to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 just days before the start of a United Nations climate summit, ending its status as an outlier among developed nations, many of which had already set such a target.<br />But Prime Minister Scott Morrison disappointed environmental groups by not committing to a more ambitious emissions-reduction goal for 2030. Many scientists say stronger action is needed to reduce emissions this decade if the world’s nations are to limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the goal in the Paris climate accord."
