    "body": "Regarding William Galston’s column “Will America Come to Taiwan’s Defense?” (Politics & Ideas, Oct. 13): The policy of strategic ambiguity is still useful; what matters is how it is implemented. The steady deterioration of American naval power in the Taiwan theater makes things far less ambiguous to China’s leadership. For example, dispatching our sole operational aircraft carrier in the South China Sea to the Persian Gulf to support our withdrawal from Afghanistan is a clear indication of America’s weakened ability to implement any policy.<br />There is no effective way to guarantee that China will choose not to invade Taiwan unless we change our posture from one of deterrence to prevention. That is, simply remove invasion as an option for the People’s Liberation Army. This can be accomplished by placing large U.S. and allied military assets in the Taiwan Strait and on Taiwan itself and keeping them there for an extended period, probably until Xi Jinping is no longer in office. This would require a change in the culture at the Pentagon and Foggy Bottom from one of timidity and vacillation to one of decisiveness and courage—not an easy business."
