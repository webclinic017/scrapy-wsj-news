    "body": "SYDNEY—Australia is backing the purchase of mobile networks in six Pacific countries, a move that foreign-policy experts say is designed to block a military rival from buying the strategically important assets.<br />The government said its export-finance arm agreed to provide $1.33 billion in funding to support the $1.6 billion purchase by  Telstra Corp. , Australia’s biggest communications provider, of the networks in Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Nauru, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu. The networks, being bought from Jamaica-based Digicel Group, are adjacent to subsea cables that carry communications between Australia and its neighbors."
