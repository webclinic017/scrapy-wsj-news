    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court kicked off its new term Monday under some of the most unusual circumstances of its history, as the justices took the bench alongside a new colleague, with a new format and in a courtroom closed to the general public because of the coronavirus pandemic.<br />When the justices sat down at 10 a.m. to hear their first case in person since March 2020—a water-rights dispute between Mississippi and Tennessee—the only people there to watch were a few of their spouses, retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, essential court personnel and accredited journalists. The spectators, roughly 80 in total, wore masks and were spaced apart throughout the courtroom."
