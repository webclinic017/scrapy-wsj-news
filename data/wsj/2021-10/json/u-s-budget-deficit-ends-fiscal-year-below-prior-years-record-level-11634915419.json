    "body": "The U.S. incurred the second-largest budget deficit on record in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, reflecting government expenditures tied to the coronavirus pandemic and adding fuel to congressional debates about proposed spending.<br />The $2.8 trillion deficit was the second largest since 1945 as a share of the nation’s gross domestic product and trailed only the prior fiscal year’s $3.1 trillion shortfall, when not adjusting for inflation."
