    "body": "The COP26 climate-change conference begins next week, and many ask: Should big companies be working with enterprises that are responsible for adding considerable amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere? Itâ€™s a fair question. For McKinsey & Co., the answer is yes.<br />McKinsey does business with utilities and companies involved with such industries as mining, oil and gas extraction, aviation, shipping and logistics, cement chemical manufacturing, agriculture, waste management, aluminum and steel production. But there is no contradiction between working with these industries and a commitment to putting the global economy on a path to net-zero emissions by 2050."
