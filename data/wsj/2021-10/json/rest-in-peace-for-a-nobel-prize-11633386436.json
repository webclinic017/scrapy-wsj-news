    "body": "The Norwegian Nobel Committee will announce the winner of the 2021 Peace Prize on Friday, with 18-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg among the betting favorites. It might be better to wait another 75 years before bestowing the honor on her.<br />When the Swedish millionaire Alfred Nobel died in 1896, he left his fortune to finance awards for “those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind.” His will called for recognition of those who made extraordinary contributions to physics, chemistry, medicine and literature. The Peace Prize is for “the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations and the abolition or reduction of standing armies and the formation and spreading of peace congresses.”"
