    "body": "An activist investor thinks  Macy’s  should split itself up. That could give the retailer a fashionable look, unlocking value, but keeping up appearances will be tough.<br />Last Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that activist shareholder Jana Partners has taken a stake in Macy’s and is urging the department store to spin off its e-commerce business. The proposal is modeled off of Saks Fifth Avenue, which earlier this year announced that it was splitting off Saks.com. That spinoff is apparently looking to go public with a target valuation of roughly $6 billion, according to a Journal report on Sunday."
