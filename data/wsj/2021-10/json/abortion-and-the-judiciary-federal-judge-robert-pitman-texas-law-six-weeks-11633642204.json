    "body": "So much for the claim that the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade on its “shadow docket.” A federal judge late Wednesday ruled that Roe remains the law of the land and blocked Texas’s ban on abortions after six weeks. While the judge is right about the current legal status of Roe, he didn’t have the legal authority to make this call.<br />The Justice Department sued Texas last month after the Court issued an unsigned opinion declining to block the law, with the three liberals and Chief Justice John Roberts dissenting. The majority didn’t rule on the merits; the order was based on the narrow grounds that abortion providers lacked Article III standing under the Constitution."
