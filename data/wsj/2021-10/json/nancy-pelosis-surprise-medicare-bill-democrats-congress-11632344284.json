    "body": "The contradictions keep piling up in the $3.5 trillion (more like $5 trillion) budget bill, and one of the biggest concerns is Medicare. The hospital trust fund is set to run dry in 2026, and Democrats worry that expensive drugs aren’t affordable. But then why do they want to add hugely expensive new coverage for dental, hearing and vision care?<br />Democrats claim that half of Medicare recipients have no dental insurance, but they’re overstating the coverage gap. Nearly nine in 10 low-income seniors have access to dental coverage through Medicaid. AARP sponsors dental plans with low premiums, and many graduate dental schools offer charity care for low-income seniors."
