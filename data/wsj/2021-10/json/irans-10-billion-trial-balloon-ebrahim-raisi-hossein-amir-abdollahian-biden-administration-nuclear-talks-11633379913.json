    "body": "Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has put nuclear negotiations on the back burner for his first two months in office, and it’s unclear whether he’s serious about ever reviving the 2015 deal. Yet Tehran certainly is open to getting paid to flirt with the idea.<br />Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said over the weekend that intermediaries approached Iranians at the United Nations General Assemblyseeking to restart nuclear talks. “I told the mediators if America’s intentions are serious then a serious indication was needed,” he said, according to Reuters. His ask was “at least $10 billion of blocked money.” The diplomat added that “they are not willing” to free up frozen funds, and the Iranian foreign ministry later said it was merely an example of a way to build goodwill."
