    "body": "When Covid-19 vaccinations became available, Jackie (a false name, yet a true story), who suffers from allergies, wasn’t sure whether or not to get vaccinated. She asked her doctor. His answer was, “Do whatever you think is right.” Of course, your own preferences should guide your health choice. Except, in this case, Jackie had no preference other than to do the right thing—if only she knew what it was.<br />Leaving the decision in her hands could be construed as treating her as a “healthcare consumer,” a term that has been growing exponentially on Google Scholar, the world’s academic research repository, as a new, more empowered term for “patient.” We’ve come a long way since 1847, when the ethical code of the American Medical Association stated, in the paternalistic manner of the time, “The obedience of a patient to the prescriptions of his physician should be prompt and implicit. He should never permit his own crude opinions as to their fitness, to influence his attention to them.” The legal introduction of informed consent in the International Code of Medical Ethics, which the World Medical Association adopted in Helsinki in 1949, required that people are told what is about to happen to them, and given choice in the matter. In 1982, a presidential commission appointed by Ronald Reagan stated that beyond its foundation in law, informed consent “is essentially an ethical imperative.”"
