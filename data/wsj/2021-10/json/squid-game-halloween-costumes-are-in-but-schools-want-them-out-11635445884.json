    "body": "“Squid Game,” the popular South Korean dystopian drama from  Netflix Inc . , is already a significant source of inspiration for Halloween costumes around the world this year. A few elementary schools in New York state, however, don’t want students donning the show’s track suits and white sneakers on its campuses.<br />School staff at Fayetteville-Manlius School District elementary schools in Manlius, N.Y., near Syracuse, recently noticed some students mimicking games from the thriller during recess, said Superintendent Craig Tice. When it came time for elementary-school principals to send around the usual reminders about inappropriate Halloween costumes — such as those with weapons or toy guns, or outfits deemed too gory — “Squid Game”-inspired ensembles joined that list."
