    "body": "OTTAWA—Coming off a third-straight election victory, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, once the world’s golden boy of liberal politics, has an increasingly narrow window to overcome damage to his image and push through policies that would mark Canada as a global progressive leader.<br />His Liberal Party’s share of the popular vote has been steadily shrinking, and minority governments in Canada, which Mr. Trudeau will lead knowing his administration can be voted out at any time if enough opposition parties cooperate to do so, have historically lasted around 18 to 24 months. That wouldn’t give Mr. Trudeau much time to implement a progressive agenda that includes greenhouse-gas reduction, improved relations with indigenous people and nationwide, subsidized child care."
