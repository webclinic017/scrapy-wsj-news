    "body": "WASHINGTON—CIA Director William Burns said on Thursday he is establishing a major organization within the agency focused on China, expanding and coordinating intelligence gathering against what top U.S. officials have described as a multipronged threat from Beijing.<br />The newly announced China Mission Center, part of an agencywide pivot toward China, will bring together case officers who recruit spies, intelligence analysts, technology experts and other specialists in a single unit. The spy agency will also recruit and train more Mandarin speakers and deploy China specialists around the world, reflecting the global nature of U.S.-China competition, a senior Central Intelligence Agency official said."
