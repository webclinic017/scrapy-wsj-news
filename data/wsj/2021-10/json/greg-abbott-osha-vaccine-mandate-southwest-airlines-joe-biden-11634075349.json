    "body": "President Biden’s excessive executive action mandating vaccines is causing an equally excessive reaction among some Republicans. See Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s order Monday banning vaccine mandates by private employers. This political vaccine jujitsu is causing real harm to Americans and U.S. social harmony.<br />Vaccines have saved tens of thousands of American lives. Most recognize that the benefits outweigh the risks, and the spread of the Delta variant propelled millions more to get vaccinated this summer. About 78% of American adults and 95% over age 65 have received at least one dose."
