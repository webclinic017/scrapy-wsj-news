    "body": "Katie Couric isn’t proud of several moments in her journalism career, like when she went “undercover” as a homeless person for a bit of stunt reporting, or the time on her Yahoo show she edited out Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s disapproving statements on athletes who kneel during the national anthem in order to “protect” her. “It was important for me to shine a lens on myself and to be introspective about my own mistakes in my own personal evolution,” Couric, 64, now says.<br />That personal journey is at the center of her new memoir, Going There, which chronicles her rise through the Big Three television networks at a time when they were brazen boys’ clubs. She became known as “America’s sweetheart” during her 15 years co-anchoring the Today Show before taking over CBS Evening News then hosting her own daytime show, Katie, on ABC. In the book, she recounts interviewing momentous figures including Barbara and George H.W. Bush, David Duke, John F. Kennedy Jr. and Sarah Palin, and she writes openly about losing her first husband, Jay Monahan, and her sister, Emily Couric, to cancer. The chapters she spends on the sexual assault allegations against her former Today co-host Matt Lauer offer a look into the experience of finding out the worst about someone you cared about and trusted."
