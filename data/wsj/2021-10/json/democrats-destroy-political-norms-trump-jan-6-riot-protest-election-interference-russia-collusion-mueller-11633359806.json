    "body": "A Rasmussen poll late last month had Donald Trump defeating President Biden by 10 points in a putative 2024 election. If Vice President Kamala Harris were the Democratic nominee, Mr. Trump’s margin of victory would be 13 points.<br />Polls at such a distance from a contest are wholly artificial. The political weather can change in three days, let alone three years. Mr. Trump may not run. Mr. Biden may not run. Ms. Harris may prove less inept in the next Democratic primary campaign than she was in the last one."
