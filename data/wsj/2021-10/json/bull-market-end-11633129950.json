    "body": "Unlike bear-market bottoms, which tend to be short and violent, bull-market tops in the stock market tend to occur gradually over time, as first one sector or investment style hits its peak and turns down, and then another.<br />That means investors shouldn’t manage their stock portfolios on the assumption there will be an exact day before which it would make sense to be 100% invested and afterward to be in cash. Even if pinpoint stock-market timing weren’t incredibly difficult, it still would make more sense to gradually build up cash as individual positions hit their targets."
