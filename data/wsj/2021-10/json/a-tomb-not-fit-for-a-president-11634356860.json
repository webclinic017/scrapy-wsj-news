    "body": "As Americans debate which figures from history should be memorialized and how, the focus is usually on statues of presidents and generals. But one of the most instructive examples is almost unknown today: an imposing marble sarcophagus that for many years was a fixture, and a curiosity, on the Mall in Washington, D.C., standing on the grass just outside the Smithsonian’s Arts and Industries Building. An information panel placed next to the sarcophagus in the 1960s identified it as the “Tomb in Which Andrew Jackson REFUSED to be Buried.” It stood, in other words, as a symbol of the down-to-earth essence of American republicanism and its distaste for the vulgar bric-a-brac of monarchy or autocracy.<br />The sarcophagus had been discovered in Lebanon in 1837 and brought to the U.S. a couple of years later by Commodore Jesse D. Elliott, the commander of a squadron of the U.S. Navy on patrol in the Mediterranean. The story was that it had once held the remains of the Roman emperor Alexander Severus, who ruled between 222 and 235 A.D."
