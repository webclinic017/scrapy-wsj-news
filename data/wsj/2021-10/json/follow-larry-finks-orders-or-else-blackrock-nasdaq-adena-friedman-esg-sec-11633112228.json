    "body": "It’s not enough for socially enlightened masters of finance like  BlackRock  and  Nasdaq  to push around publicly traded companies. Now they want the Securities and Exchange Commission to impose their social and political agenda on all companies, including private firms.<br />The SEC is expected soon to propose rules requiring companies to publicly disclose climate, board diversity and human-capital metrics. Large asset managers and government pension funds have found mixed success pressuring public companies to adopt these disclosures, which is why they are now endorsing government coercion."
