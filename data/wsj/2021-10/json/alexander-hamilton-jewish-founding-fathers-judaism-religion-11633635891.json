    "body": "Ten years ago I decided to enliven constitutional history for my students by sharing biographical curiosities about the Founding Fathers. Thomas Jefferson once received a “mammoth cheese” that weighed more than 1,200 pounds. James Madison lost re-election to the Virginia legislature because he refused to dispense free whiskey to voters. Alexander Hamilton, the Caribbean orphan turned financial visionary—well, something about his origin story left me unsettled.<br />Numerous biographers have noted that Hamilton’s mother was named Rachel Levine and that she enrolled him in a Jewish school on his native island of Nevis. Yet no scholar took seriously the idea that mother and son might have claimed a Jewish identity. Hamilton’s status as a cradle-to-grave Christian was taken on faith."
