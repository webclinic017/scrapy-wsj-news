    "body": "A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction blocking a Texas law that imposes a near-ban on abortion. Since the law went into effect on Sept. 1, it has largely shut down abortion in the state by prohibiting the procedure after about the sixth week of pregnancy. The Supreme Court had earlier declined to block the Texas Heartbeat Act, or SB 8, from taking effect, rejecting by a 5-4 vote an emergency request from abortion clinics. Since then, the Justice Department filed its own lawsuit. Here’s what you should know about the status of the law.<br />There were legal proceedings ahead of SB 8’s Sept. 1 effective date, with abortion clinics seeking to block the six-week ban before it took hold. The Supreme Court’s order late that evening allowed the Texas law to take effect but didn’t address its merits or whether future lawsuits could succeed in obtaining judicial review of the ban. Instead, the unsigned majority opinion, one paragraph long, only said the court couldn’t intervene because of procedural uncertainties over the proper defendant in the clinics’ lawsuit."
