    "body": "FISHNETS SHOULD SUE Halloween for defamation. At some point after “sexy” Halloween costumes gained currency in the 1970s, the stockings became unfairly associated with too-short polyester getups sold by such questionable clothiers as Party City. Want to be a racy witch? Pull on black webbed tights. A naughty nurse? You’ll need white, thigh-high versions. A sensual skunk? Take your perforated pick.<br />This fall, however, fishnets could transcend their tawdry reputation as cheap All Hallows’ Eve novelties. During a recent runway show, Chanel creative director Virginie Viard teamed wide-gauge fishnets with genteel tweed suits. And 71-year-old Austrian hosiery and bodywear brand Wolford currently offers 21 different colors of fishnets in eight different styles, including $450 crystal-embellished pairs made in collaboration with Paris-based designer Amina Mauddi. Silvia Azzali, Wolford’s chief commercial officer, reports that the brand’s fishnet sales are up 60% between January and September compared to the previous year, with larger-weave and nude sets among the most popular. Ms. Azzali, who wears flesh-toned pairs with suits for business meetings, attributes the increase to a post-lockdown lust for extreme elegance."
