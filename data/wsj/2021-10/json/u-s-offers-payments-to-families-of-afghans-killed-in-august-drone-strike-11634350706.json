    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. has offered payments to the families of Afghans killed in a drone strike in the waning days of the war in Afghanistan and is supporting one family’s efforts to relocate to the U.S., the Pentagon said Friday.<br />Last month, the Pentagon acknowledged that at least 10 Afghan civilians had been killed in a drone strike on a car in Kabul in August, an attack intended to kill an Islamic State terrorist believed to be driving a bomb toward U.S. troops at Kabul’s airport. U.S. military officials had maintained for nearly three weeks that the strike was justified, at one point acknowledging that civilians may have been killed but that militants had been stopped from attacking U.S. troops."
