    "body": "If you’ve had property damage from a disaster like a fire or flood this year, will the losses be tax deductible? For millions of Americans, the answer depends on what Congress does in the next few months.<br />So far this year, there have been 18 weather-related disasters across the country costing more than $1 billion each, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That compares with an average of 16 per year for 2016 through 2020. This year’s disasters include some doozies: the winter freezes in Texas and Oklahoma, wildfires in California and Hurricane Ida on the Gulf Coast and the Northeast."
