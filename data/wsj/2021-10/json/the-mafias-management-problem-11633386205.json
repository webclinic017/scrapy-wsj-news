    "body": "This column frequently covers the persistent and historic American worker shortage, a sad tale of misguided Covid lockdowns, government disincentives to work, immigration restrictions and lost opportunities. But the best news of the day involves a shortage of talented and industrious employees in a particular sector of the underground economy.

The Journal’s James Fanelli explains that just like the fictional mob boss Tony Soprano, real alleged gangsters aren’t able to maintain a safe distance from crimes allegedly committed on their behalf because they don’t trust junior staff to get jobs done."
