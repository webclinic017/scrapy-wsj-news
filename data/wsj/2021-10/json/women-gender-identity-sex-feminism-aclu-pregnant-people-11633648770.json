    "body": "Nicole Ault’s op-ed “The ACLU Decides ‘Woman’ Is a Bad Word” (Oct. 4) is an excellent riposte to the latest attempt to gerrymander reality via politically driven manipulation of the English language. Her final comment about where this might stop is more than an abstract question about the range of possible identities. It has worrying political implications, too.<br />In a world where anyone can be whoever or whatever they feel, it is inevitable that some identities will stand in insufferable contradiction to others—the conservative Christian to that of the queer activist, for example. If society is to be at all coherent, this means that somebody is going to have to decide which identities are privileged and which are not."
