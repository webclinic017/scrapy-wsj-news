    "body": "Advocating peace can be dangerous in the Middle East. My organization sponsored a Sept. 24 conference in the Iraqi Kurdish city of Erbil, which drew 312 prominent Sunnis and Shiites from around the country who urged Iraq to join the Abraham Accords and make peace with Israel. The government in Baghdad dubbed the attendees “criminals” and issued arrest warrants, while Iran-backed Shiite militias threatened to kill participants and fire rockets at Erbil.<br />The first speaker was Wisam Al-Hardan, leader of the Sons of Iraq Awakening movement, or Sahwa, of Sunni tribal fighters against al Qaeda and ISIS. I helped him prepare his speech, which was adapted into an op-ed for these pages. Shortly before the conference, Mr. Al-Hardan told me he was worried about the threats that would inevitably follow. I urged him to do whatever he felt was right. He steeled himself and took the stage."
