    "body": "Boeing Co. ’s Starliner space vehicle won’t get to attempt launch again this year, NASA officials said Wednesday, and two astronauts who were meant to fly on it were reassigned to a future mission using a SpaceX ship.<br />Boeing and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration had planned to fly the Starliner, without crew on board, to the International Space Station this past summer. The vehicle, launched into space on a rocket from which it separates, must complete such a test flight before it can try to ferry astronauts to the facility. Boeing and the space agency in August postponed a test mission because some valves on the Starliner’s propulsion system became stuck before launch."
