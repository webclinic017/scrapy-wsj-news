    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”President Biden on Friday signed a law providing financial support for U.S. government personnel who have suffered the mysterious neurological attacks known as Havana Syndrome, a step victims describe as a milestone in their yearslong quest for recognition and medical treatment.<br />Roughly 200 U.S. diplomats, intelligence officers, military officers and others have been struck in locations ranging from Europe and the Western Hemisphere to China. Symptoms include severe headaches, fatigue, memory loss and cognitive difficulties. U.S. intelligence agencies are still struggling to determine who is behind the attacks, which were first reported in Havana five years ago, and which weapon or mechanism is behind them."
