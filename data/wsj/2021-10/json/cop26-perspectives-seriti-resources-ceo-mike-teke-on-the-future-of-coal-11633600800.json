    "body": "When global leaders thrash out their climate commitments in Glasgow next month, coal is likely to be in the crosshairs.<br />To meet their targets for reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions, “countries will need to accelerate the phaseout of coal,” the U.K. says in its list of aims for the United Nations’ COP26 conference in Scotland.

China has committed to stop building coal-fired power plants overseas."
