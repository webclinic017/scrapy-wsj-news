    "sub_head": "U.S. adds more than 80,000 deaths over past two months",

    "body": "The Delta coronavirus variant’s deadly surge through the U.S. is leveling off, another sign that the nation’s most recent wave has crested.<br />The seven-day average for daily reports of new Covid-19 deaths has hovered near 2,000 for more than a week, and on Thursday slipped below 1,900, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. That follows a roughly two-month climb in deaths as Delta swept particularly aggressively through the southern U.S., hammering states like Florida, Louisiana and Arkansas. Public-health authorities and researchers say severe illness and deaths have largely hit unvaccinated populations."
