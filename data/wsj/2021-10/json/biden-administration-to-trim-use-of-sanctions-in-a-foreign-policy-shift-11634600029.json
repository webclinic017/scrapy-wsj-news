    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The Biden administration plans to limit the use of economic and financial sanctions in a shift that Treasury Department officials said should strengthen the impact of a tactic that U.S. foreign policy has relied on in recent years.<br />After a nine-month Treasury-led audit of sanctions policy, the officials said Monday that sanctions will remain a critical policy tool but need to be better calibrated. To that end, the officials said, a new interagency process will be put in place to vet possible sanctions and weigh the potential for unintended harm to vulnerable groups, resistance from allies and other economic and geopolitical fallout."
