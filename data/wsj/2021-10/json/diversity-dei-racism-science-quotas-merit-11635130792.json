    "body": "We have just learned that Chinese scientists were able to launch hypersonic rockets for which we have no defense. Meanwhile, we are re-evaluating the funding of significant research of senior scientists based on their commitment to diversity equity and inclusion (“How ‘Diversity’ Turned Tyrannical” by Lawrence Krauss, op-ed, Oct. 21). Young scientists apparently must demonstrate a strong commitment to the diversity, equity and inclusion agenda and may be rejected on their diversity statements before scientific merit is evaluated.<br />While it is laudable to attempt to achieve more diversity and inclusion in our scientific community, that should not take precedence over scientific merit. We must remember what we’re up against: China has some one million Uyghurs in concentration camps and is most likely responsible for the death of millions of people from the Covid pandemic."
