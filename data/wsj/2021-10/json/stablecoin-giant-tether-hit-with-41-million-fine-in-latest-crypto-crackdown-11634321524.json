    "body": "WASHINGTON—Tether Ltd., the largest stablecoin issuer, agreed to pay a federal regulator a $41 million penalty Friday, the latest result of the Biden administration’s broader crackdown on cryptocurrency markets.<br />The Commodity Futures Trading Commission accused Tether of falsely claiming that it backed each of its crypto tokens with an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars. It marked the first time the CFTC has applied to a stablecoin the broad legal definition of a “commodity,” which gives the agency authority to police fraud and manipulation."
