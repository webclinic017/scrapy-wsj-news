    "body": "Pro-democracy protesters in Sudan vowed Tuesday to resist a military coup of their transitional government through nationwide civil disobedience, deepening a high stakes standoff that leaves the country with no clear path out of a debilitating economic and political crisis.<br />Much of the capital Khartoum and other major cities remained closed down, with protesters erecting roadblocks and most stores, banks, government offices and schools closed a day after the military detained the prime minister and other civilian leaders and declared a state of emergency."
