    "body": "By revealing strong data for its experimental Covid-19 antiviral treatment,  Merck  & Co. and its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics have apparently struck a major blow against the pandemic. The news also has rejuvenated Merck’s stock price and could jump-start the moribund biotech sector.<br />Merck and closely held Ridgeback Biotherapeutics said Friday their oral drug molnupiravir reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by about 50% in patients with mild to moderate Covid-19. The companies plan to ask the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization in the coming weeks. Merck expects to produce enough medicine to treat 10 million patients by the end of this year and more in 2022."
