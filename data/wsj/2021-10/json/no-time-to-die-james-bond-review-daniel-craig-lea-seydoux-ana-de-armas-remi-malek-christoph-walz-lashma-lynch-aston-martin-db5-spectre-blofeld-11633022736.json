    "body": "‘No Time to Die” is the latest James Bond episode and the last one to star Daniel Craig. His performance elevates—all but ennobles—the dramatic core of an otherwise choppy narrative, a succession of impressive but impersonal action sequences and affecting interludes that lead to a stirring climax.<br />Time figures in more than the title. The film evokes time’s haunting passage— how long its hitherto indestructible hero has been saving the planet from a bountiful supply of malefactors, how much the years and decades have given and taken from him. (The running time, not incidentally, is 163 minutes, including some late-stage sags. It is in theaters Wednesday.) When the story gets up to speed after a short, pungent preface, Bond and the woman he has cautiously allowed himself to love, Léa Seydoux’s psychiatrist Madeleine Swann, are in a car on a cliff-clinging road in southern Italy. It’s not just any car but the same venerable Aston Martin DB5 in which they drove off happily at the end of the 2015 “Spectre.” Now, in the afterglow of their getaway, she wants him to drive faster, but he resists “We have all the time in the world,” he says serenely."
