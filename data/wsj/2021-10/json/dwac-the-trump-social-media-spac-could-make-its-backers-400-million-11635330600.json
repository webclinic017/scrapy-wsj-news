    "body": "The obscure financiers who launched the shell company that is taking former President Donald Trump’s social-media venture public are poised for a big payday if the deal gets completed.<br />The total windfall would stand at about $400 million at the stock’s current price, after shares skyrocketed sixfold following the deal’s announcement. The pay framework isn’t Trump-specific—it comes from the distinctive structure of special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, such as  Digital World Acquisition Corp."
