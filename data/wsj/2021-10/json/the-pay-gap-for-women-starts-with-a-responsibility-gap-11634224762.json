    "body": "The Covid pandemic has left women exhausted from the competing demands of work and family. According to a recent McKinsey survey of 40,000 employees of U.S. companies, women report feeling more burned out and chronically stressed than men do. This holds for every race and across all levels of business, especially at the top.<br />These women are now returning to workplaces where they are paid less than men at the same level, on average, and there are fewer of them the higher up they go. Part of the reason for that—or so they are told in popular culture and by some leading researchers—is that women don’t ask for as much money or responsibility as men, that they lack confidence, or that they’ve made “career-limiting moves” by seeking flexible schedules or time off for parenting."
