    "body": "Europe’s top health regulator issued a broad endorsement of Covid-19 vaccine booster shots, diverging from U.S. officials’ more limited recommendation, and paving the way for more countries across the continent to offer additional doses to the already vaccinated.<br />An expert committee for the European Medicines Agency said Monday that the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. with  BioNTech SE  could be given as a booster to those aged 18 and over, at least six months after their second dose. It is still evaluating data for booster shots of Moderna Inc.’s vaccine, but said that it or Pfizer’s shot could be administered to people with weakened immune systems at least 28 days after their second dose."
