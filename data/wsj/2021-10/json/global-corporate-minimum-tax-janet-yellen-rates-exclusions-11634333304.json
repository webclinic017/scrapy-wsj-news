    "body": "The proposed 15% global corporate minimum tax is a big idea (“The Global Tax Damage,” Review & Outlook, Oct. 9), and on the surface it might seem like a no-brainer. But tax policy and legislative history, along with the history of the shenanigans used to get around restrictions provided by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, prove that the 15% rate will not end up solving the problem. (A review of the changing Internal Revenue Code sections regarding domestic international sales corporations is instructive.)<br />Countries will still be free to define tax expenditures—exclusions from income, deferrals of income, deductions and credits as they see fit. It is unlikely that a global treaty that limits their ability to do so could be crafted and approved. Just as a tax base can be broadened and the tax rate lowered, a tax base can be narrowed and a tax rate increased. Narrowing the tax base could, in effect, keep the tax due where it was before the increase in the rate. Assuming the 15% initiative gets past our Senate, it will be interesting to see how it all turns out. In the meantime, it will create work for the accountants and tax lawyers who have undoubtedly started brainstorming ways around it."
