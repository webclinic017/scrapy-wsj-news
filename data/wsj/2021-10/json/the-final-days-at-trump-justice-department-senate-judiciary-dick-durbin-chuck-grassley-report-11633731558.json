    "body": "Democrats can’t quit the 2020 election any more than Donald Trump can, and their latest effort in looking backward is a Senate report that suggests the former President nearly succeeded in corrupting the Justice Department with a goal of overturning the election result. Except that the facts tell a different story.<br />Dick Durbin’s Judiciary Committee issued a report Thursday focusing on, among other things, then Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark and a draft letter he wanted to send in December recommending that state legislatures convene special sessions to void Joe Biden’s victory."
