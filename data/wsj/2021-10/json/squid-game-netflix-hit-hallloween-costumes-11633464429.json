    "body": "“Squid Game,” the South Korean dystopian thriller which debuted on  Netflix  on Sept. 17, is on track to be the platform’s biggest hit to date. With Halloween on the horizon, the tremendously popular show has also spawned an onslaught of “Squid Game” costumes. On  Amazon.com ,  you’ll find over 2,000 results for the term “Squid Game costume.” Google trends, the search engine’s in-house platform that tracks user interest, reported that for the week ending October 2, searches for “Squid Game costume” reached a new high. And though the holiday is still weeks away, Instagram users are already giddily posting their themed outfits with the hashtag #SquidGameCostume.<br />The scripted show’s costumes are blissfully simple. In “Squid Game,” financially troubled contestants play traditional Korean children’s games on a secluded island, vying for a cash prize. Losers are promptly killed. The desperate contestants who compete in the show’s twisted game all wear  basic white slip-on sneakers and forest-green tracksuits with their assigned numbers stitched on the left side. The pinkish-red jumpsuits worn by the show’s menacing guards are even less intricate."
