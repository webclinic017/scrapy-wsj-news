    "body": "LONDON—The U.S. appealed to a British court to allow the extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, arguing that he wouldn’t be held in a maximum-security prison should the U.K. send him to the U.S. for trial on charges of breaking espionage laws.<br />In January, a U.K. court blocked Mr. Assange’s extradition to the U.S. because he was deemed a suicide risk if he were held in a federal maximum-security, or “Supermax,” prison."
