    "body": "A pair of MacBook Pro laptops—and a pair of chips—shared center stage at  Apple Inc.’s  streamed Monday event, which also included the debut of new AirPods.<br />The new designs with 16-inch and 14-inch displays have curves reminiscent of classic MacBooks, and that’s not all that’s back: Apple brought back HDMI and SD card slots, along with the MagSafe magnetic power plug. (The laptops still have Thunderbolt 4/USB-C ports which you can use to power them and connect monitors and other peripherals.)"
