    "body": "Many people are familiar with what is known as Zoom fatigue, described as the feeling of being drained and lacking energy following a day of virtual meetings. Now, new research suggests that women and newer employees may be most susceptible to the phenomenon and that allowing people to turn off their cameras during meetings could make a big difference.<br />According to the study, published in the Journal of Applied Psychology in August, the degree of fatigue isn’t affected by the amount of time spent in virtual meetings or the number of meetings attended. However, having one’s camera on during meetings all day—versus having it off—does make people feel tired."
