    "body": "LOS ANGELES—James Bond finally faced off at the box office against a foe he couldn’t seem to shake, and the result was something of a draw.<br />The 25th installment in the Bond franchise, “No Time to Die,” opened to an estimated $56 million in the U.S. and Canada after the movie was delayed for more than a year due to Covid-19. Even though auditoriums around the world have largely reopened, the lingering effects of the pandemic appeared to dent the movie’s performance, which runs a bit behind its predecessors in the series."
