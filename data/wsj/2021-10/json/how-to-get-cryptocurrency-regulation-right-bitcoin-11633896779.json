    "body": "As the cryptocurrency universe expands, with innovative offerings and thousands of new users each week, the U.S. regulatory response has been slow and uneven.<br />In certain areas, U.S. regulators have successfully applied traditional models. The Securities and Exchange Commission treats those who issue new speculative cryptocurrencies like issuers of securities. The Treasury Department’s anti-money-laundering office, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, regulates firms that transfer or exchange cryptocurrencies as money-service businesses—like  Western Union —with the accompanying responsibility of knowing their customers and monitoring for suspicious activity."
