    "body": "Vladimir Putin can smell weakness like a wolf, and these days he’s preying on Europe’s energy emergency to increase his influence at the European Union’s periphery. Consider Moscow’s pressure on Moldova.<br />The small country’s gas contract with Russia’s state-owned Gazprom expired in September. Moscow, which had provided 100% of the country’s gas, promptly cut supplies by a third. Gazprom then asked for a major price hike to keep the gas coming, and Moldova eventually declared a state of emergency."
