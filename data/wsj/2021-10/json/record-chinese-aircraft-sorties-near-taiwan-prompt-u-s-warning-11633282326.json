    "body": "Beijing flew 93 military sorties near Taiwan over three days as China celebrated its National Day holiday, its largest such prodding in the past year, prompting the U.S. to warn against what it called provocative military activity.<br />On Friday, the Chinese sent 38 military aircraft, including J-16 jet fighters, H-6 strategic bombers and Y-8 submarine-spotting aircraft, flying into Taiwan’s southwestern air-defense identification zone, more than in any other sortie over the past year. The following day, the People’s Liberation Army broke that record by sending 39 more aircraft. On Sunday, China sent another 16 military aircraft, according to Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense."
