    "body": "ROME—Pope Francis will travel to Canada in an effort to heal relations with the country’s indigenous communities, following scandals over the abuse of generations of indigenous children at church-run residential schools.<br />The Vatican said on Wednesday that the pope “has indicated his willingness to visit” Canada, at a date yet to be determined, in response to a request from the country’s Catholic bishops. The pope would travel “also in the context of the long-standing pastoral process of reconciliation with indigenous peoples,” the Vatican said."
