    "body": "U.S. job growth likely rebounded last month as schools reopened and leisure and hospitality businesses stepped up hiring. But a persistent shortage of workers is restraining the labor marketâ€™s recovery, economists say.<br />Economists estimate that employers created 500,000 jobs in September, more than double the number added in August, according to a Wall Street Journal survey. The jobless rate is believed to have declined to 5.1% from 5.2% a month earlier."
