    "body": "ROME—Pope Francis on Wednesday approved a miracle attributed to the intercession of Pope John Paul I, who reigned for only 33 days in 1978. The decision clears the way for the late pontiff’s beatification, the Catholic Church’s highest honor short of sainthood.<br />The Vatican didn’t immediately announce a date or place for the ceremony of beatification, but previous beatifications of popes have been performed by the reigning pontiff at the Vatican."
