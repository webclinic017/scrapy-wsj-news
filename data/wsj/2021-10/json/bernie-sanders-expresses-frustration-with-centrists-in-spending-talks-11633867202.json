    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”Bernie Sanders has pushed Congress for decades to expand the social safety net and fight climate change, with limited success. Now, with Democrats on the brink of finalizing such a package, the Vermont senator must decide how much is enough.<br />The party is currently locked in negotiations over winnowing down a $3.5 trillion education, healthcare, child-care and climate plan, after Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona balked at the initial price tag. They are negotiating with the White House and Democratic leadership to find a compromise on what programs to fund and for how long, a process that has prompted increasing frustration from Mr. Sanders."
