    "body": "Europe has mustered an almost united front behind global tax reform. Now it is the U.S. that needs to get its house in order.<br />On Friday evening in Paris, about 130 nations are expected to announce a new deal on global corporate taxation. Key holdout Ireland said it would back the deal late Thursday.
