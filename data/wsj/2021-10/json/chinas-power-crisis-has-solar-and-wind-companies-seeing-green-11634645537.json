    "body": "China’s power crunch may be darkening the sky for now. But it is already shaping up as an impetus for greener electricity in the country.<br />Recent severe power shortages in China have led to factory shutdowns and blackouts, and rippled through global supply chains. Skyrocketing prices of coal, the main fuel for producing power in China, are a key cause—especially when combined with a rigid electricity pricing mechanism. Many power plants in China are operating at a loss. Tough power consumption restrictions from local governments scrambling to meet carbon targets are another factor."
