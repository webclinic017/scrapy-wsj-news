    "body": "WASHINGTON—Top Senate Democrats and Republicans blamed each other for the failure of Congress to raise the nation’s debt ceiling, with some Democrats floating possible changes to the Senate’s filibuster rule to resolve the impasse, ahead of a possible default in as little as two weeks.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) has set up a Wednesday vote—the third one in the past two weeks—on clearing a procedural hurdle that stands in the way of raising the debt ceiling. But Republicans, protesting Democrats’ separate spending ambitions, indicated they would continue to stand united in withholding their support for a debt-ceiling increase, which needs 60 votes to move forward in the 50-50 Senate."
