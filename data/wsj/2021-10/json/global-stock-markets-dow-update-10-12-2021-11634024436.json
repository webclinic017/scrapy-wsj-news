    "body": "U.S. stock futures wobbled, as rising energy prices exacerbated concerns about inflation, and lingering worries about Chinaâ€™s property sector weighed on sentiment.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 edged up 0.1% Tuesday, a day after the broad index was pulled lower by ongoing concerns about slowing growth and inflation. Futures for the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average also added 0.1% while the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 rose 0.2%."
