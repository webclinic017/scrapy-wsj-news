    "body": "OUR KAYAKS slid through the water, each splash from our paddles dappling light on the sand visible below. Before heading out for a remote lakeside camp deep in Yellowstone National Park, my three friends and I had packed the boats with tents, sleeping bags and three days worth of food. Compared with struggling along under the weight of a backpack, it was a delightfully effortless way to haul our stuff.<br />The scenery we glided by could have been any pretty mountain lake, save for the grizzly bear, elk and mule deer tracks imprinted in the volcanic sand beaches and the white steamy wisps that rose from an unseen hydrothermal hot pot."
