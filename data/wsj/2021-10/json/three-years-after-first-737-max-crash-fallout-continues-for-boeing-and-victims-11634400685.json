    "body": "When federal prosecutors on Thursday brought fraud charges against a former  Boeing Co.  pilot, it marked the latest chapter in the crisis involving the plane maker’s 737 MAX. Mark Forknerwas charged with six counts of fraud related to his alleged role in persuading the Federal Aviation Administration to approve pilot-training materials that excluded references to the flight-control system known as MCAS, later blamed for two crashes of the jet.<br />Mr. Forkner, who pleaded not guilty during a court appearance in Fort Worth, Texas on Friday, is the only person charged in connection with Boeing’s interactions with the FAA about the crashes. Almost three years after the first accident, here is the status of efforts to assign responsibility following accidents that killed 346 people, sending one of America’s biggest companies into crisis."
