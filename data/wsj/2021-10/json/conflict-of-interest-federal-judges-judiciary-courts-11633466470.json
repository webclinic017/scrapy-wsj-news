    "body": "Regarding “Federal Judges Heard Cases Despite a Financial Interest” (Page One, Sept. 29): Annual ethics training is required for all federal employees, including judges. As a career Navy lawyer, I conducted annual ethics training for civilian and military employees. I once had to recuse myself from defending a suit filed by a corporation represented by my husband’s law firm, but not by my husband personally.<br />If a GS-12 contracting officer I advised knew not to share an expensive cab ride with opposing counsel from the courthouse unless they split the fare, federal judges can figure out their conflicts or get competent advice—or they shouldn’t be on the bench. Ethics rules prohibit the appearance of unethical conduct as well as actual unethical conduct."
