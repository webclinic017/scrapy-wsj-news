    "body": "Janine di Giovanni’s “The Vanishing: Faith, Loss, and the Twilight of Christianity in the Land of the Prophets” opens and closes with beautiful evocations of the power of faith in trying times. Speaking of how her own faith guided her through the initial uncertainty of the Covid-19 pandemic, she ties this experience to the strong testaments of faith she witnessed—and experienced—while reporting on the Middle East’s diminishing Christian communities. Ms. di Giovanni, an award-winning author, journalist and former Guggenheim Fellow, found new meaning in the traditions of her Catholic upbringing. “Faith meant two things to me: ritual and a sense of belonging,” she writes. “Regardless of where I was in the world, I felt a sense of being part of a larger community, no matter how difficult, dark, or dangerous the situation was.”<br />In the largely secular world of international journalism, it’s refreshing to hear from a correspondent who participated in, rather than merely observed, one of the most fundamental aspects of life in the Middle East: religious practice."
