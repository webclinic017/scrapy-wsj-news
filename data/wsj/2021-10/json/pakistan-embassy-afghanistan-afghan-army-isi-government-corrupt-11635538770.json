    "body": "For 20 years, successive Afghan governments laid the blame for every problem in Afghanistan on Pakistan’s doorstep. Javid Ahmad’s op-ed “How Pakistan Won in Afghanistan” (Oct. 27) betrays the same breathtaking lack of introspection and refusal to accept any responsibility that was the hallmark of the government he represented until Aug. 15, when former President Ashraf Ghani fled Kabul.<br />Contrary to Mr. Ahmed’s claims, Pakistan vigorously supported (and still supports) an inclusive political settlement in Afghanistan. On at least two occasions, Pakistan joined China, Russia and the U.S. in categorically opposing any government installed by force in Afghanistan."
