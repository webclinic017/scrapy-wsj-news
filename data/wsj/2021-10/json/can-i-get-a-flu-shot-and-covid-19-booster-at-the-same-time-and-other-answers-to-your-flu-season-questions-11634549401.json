Officials suggest getting them in different arms, or at least an inch apart if in the same arm.<br />“Other than maybe making your arm more sore or having two arms that are sore, there’s not a whole lot of interaction between the two of them,” says Rachel Presti, an infectious-disease physician at Washington University in St. Louis. She’s had patients get both vaccines on the same day. “We know from other vaccines that generally giving them together is fine.”"
