    "body": "‘The more I see of other people’s children, the less I dislike my own,” Evelyn Waugh wrote to his friend and fellow author Nancy Mitford. Waugh’s equal-opportunity dyspepsia—he disliked people of all ages, not just youngsters—propels his 1934 novel, “A Handful of Dust,” as it spirals down from a brittle comedy of manners to a nightmare of loss and abandonment.<br />Waugh set his tale among people and events he knew well: the Bright Young Things of pre-World War II England, whose lives were a boozy round of parties and assignations, at country houses, weekend hunts and London clubs. At the pinnacle of the novel’s restless, gilded set are the aristocratic Tony Last and his beautiful wife, Brenda. Although Tony’s inheritance is stretched thin by the upkeep of Hetton Abbey, his family’s country seat, he and Brenda enjoy glittering indolence. Seven years into their marriage, they preside over a substantial—if drafty—estate, where they host friends and pay desultory attention to their young son."
