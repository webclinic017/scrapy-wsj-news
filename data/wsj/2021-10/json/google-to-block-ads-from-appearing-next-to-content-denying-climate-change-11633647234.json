    "body": "Alphabet Inc.’s  Google will no longer allow digital ads bought on its platform to appear next to online content that denies climate change, a ban that will also apply to YouTube, the company’s giant online-video service.<br />The ban applies to “content that contradicts the well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change,” Google, the world’s largest digital-ad company by revenue, said in a blog post Thursday. It also applies to any content denying that human activity or greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change."
