    "body": "Improbably, perhaps, for a man of his sumptuous literary gifts, Colin Thubron is one hardy hombre. The most eloquent travel writer in Britain—there can be no argument after the death last year of Jan Morris—he set out at the age of nearly 80 to traverse a river 2,826 miles long.<br />The result is “The Amur River,” whose subject, the world’s 10th longest river, forms the border between Russia and China—“a fault-line,” Mr. Thubron writes, “shrouded in old mistrust.” With ruminative gracefulness, he describes his eastward journey from the Amur’s “sacred” source in Mongolia to the near-dead port of Nikolaevsk-on-Amur on Russia’s Eastern Coast. It is here that the river decants into the Sea of Okhotsk with a “sense of thwarted purpose”—as if “all human life dwindled away at its colossal estuary.”"
