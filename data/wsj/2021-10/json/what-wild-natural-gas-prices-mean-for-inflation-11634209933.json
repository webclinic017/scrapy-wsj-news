    "body": "Europe’s crazy jump in gas prices is having surprisingly little impact on inflation in the region. In another year, though, the effect could be more dramatic.<br />European wholesale gas prices on spot markets have roughly tripled this year, but the average retail consumer gas price is up only about 9%, according to UBS. Anna Titareva, an economist at the bank, estimates the impact on the region’s inflation at about 0.4 percentage points. By comparison, a more moderate 50% rise in oil prices added 0.6 percentage points to inflation."
