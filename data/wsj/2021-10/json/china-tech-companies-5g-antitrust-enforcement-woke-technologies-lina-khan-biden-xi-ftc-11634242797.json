    "body": "China is investing $1.4 trillion to overtake the West in critical technologies by 2025. Beijing aims to control the commanding heights of 5G wireless, artificial intelligence, quantum computing and blockchain—technologies that promise to coordinate control between digital services and machines through the Internet of Things.<br />Xi Jinping’s China seeks to dominate these technologies so it can monitor, and thereby control, the world. Washington, suddenly alert to this threat, is trying to limit the penetration of world markets by Chinese tech giants like Huawei."
