    "body": "Waterville, Maine<br />You can’t talk about Bob Thompson, a mid-20th-century Black figurative artist, without mentioning the blazing colors of his paintings. Bright reds, blues, greens and yellows are almost everywhere. When, in 1998, the Whitney Museum gave him a retrospective, curator Thelma Golden, now the director of the Studio Museum in Harlem, flaunted the pervasiveness of his intense hues by hanging his works on walls painted in brilliant yellow or red—an unprecedented, much-remarked, winning move at a time when no one else dared to challenge the ubiquity of the white-walled galleries that still prevail in modern art museums."
