    "body": "The alarms raised by your editorial on the Labor Department proposed rule are misguided (“Your New Woke 401(k),” Oct. 21). The proposed rule doesn’t direct retirement fiduciaries to make specific investment choices. Rather, using plain language, it clarifies the confusion caused by the previous administration’s use of the term “nonpecuniary” to describe environmental, social and governance criteria. The Biden administration proposal correctly leaves judgments about investment criteria to financial professionals to determine what is best for their plan participants.<br />It should be remembered that the response to the Trump-era proposal was overwhelmingly in opposition, including 95% of the comments from the financial-services industry."
