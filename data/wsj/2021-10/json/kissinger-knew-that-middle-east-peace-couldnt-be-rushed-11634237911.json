    "body": "The Middle East has become a graveyard for American dreams of turning the world into a peaceful domain. If two decades of warfighting in Iraq and Afghanistan have proved the limits of U.S. force, two decades of Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking have demonstrated the limits of U.S. diplomacy. Four presidents, from Bill Clinton to Donald Trump, tried and failed to resolve the conflict. The fifth, Joe Biden, doesn’t even intend to try.<br />Who can blame him? The last Israeli-Palestinian agreement was in 1998—23 years ago. The last Israeli-Palestinian negotiation (which I mediated as Barack Obama’s special envoy) ended in failure seven years ago. Donald Trump then entered office swearing that he was going to do it his way. To this task, he appointed three businessmen with no experience in Middle East diplomacy, including his son-in-law. They failed, too. Mr. Trump would point to the Abraham Accords between Israel and the United Arab Emirates as his success. But that breakthrough, though admirable, was between countries that aren’t at war. His elaborate plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace failed even to get out of the starting gate."
