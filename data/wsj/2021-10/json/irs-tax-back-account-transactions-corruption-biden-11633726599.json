    "body": "Your editorial “The IRS and Your Bank Account” (Oct. 5) raises the specter of government snooping through every bank account with at least $600 in transactions (now $10,000). If the IRS truly wanted to increase receipts, it should start by cashing the checks it receives.<br />Shortly after my mother passed away in January 2020, the first “stimulus” check was deposited in her bank account. After some diligent searching on the IRS’s nonuser-friendly website, I was able to find a way to return it. I did so, with a cover letter. As of today, many months later, the check has not been cashed. I guess when Congress gives the IRS its $80 billion, it will hire someone who knows how to fill out a deposit slip."
