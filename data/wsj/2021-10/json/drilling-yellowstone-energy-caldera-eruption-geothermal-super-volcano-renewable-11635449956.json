    "body": "It’s not often that nature provides a win-win for it and humanity, but the caldera system under Yellowstone National Park is certainly one. If harnessed, it could power much of America for generations. Ignoring it means a guaranteed eruption and the destruction of a great portion of the U.S. and Canada.<br />In 2017 scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory evaluated the caldera’s energy flows as well as the potential damage and probability of a super-volcanic eruption, which has happened at Yellowstone three times previously. The last such eruption was 631,000 years ago; the one before that was 669,000 years prior. It’s not a matter of if it’ll erupt but when. The JPL found that the devastation of such an eruption would exceed that of an asteroid 1½ miles wide crashing to Earth."
