    "body": "Facebook Inc.  has grown at an explosive pace. Since 2012, the year it went public, the total number of employees on staff has grown by an average of 38% a year, hitting 63,404 in June, according to company filings.<br />That expansion has helped the company scoop up more than a third of the global population as users and gobble up ever more digital-ad dollars. In recent years, facing criticism over problems on its platforms, Chairman and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and other leaders have touted Facebook’s hiring of tens of thousands of people to review content and enforce its rules."
