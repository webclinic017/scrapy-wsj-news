    "body": "WASHINGTON—Democrats still tussling over how to scale back their ambitions to expand the country’s social benefits and overhaul its climate-change policy face dwindling time to reach an agreement as both the House and Senate return to Washington this week.<br />One major element related to climate change—a $150 billion program aimed at pushing utilities to draw more power from clean-energy sources—could be cut from the bill, according to people familiar with the negotiations, as it has drawn objections from the centrist Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia."
