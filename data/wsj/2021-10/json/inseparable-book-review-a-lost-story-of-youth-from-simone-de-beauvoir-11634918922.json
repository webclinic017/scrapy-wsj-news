    "body": "Simone de Beauvoir, born in 1908 in Paris, was the older of two daughters of a strict Catholic couple, and as a child dreamed of becoming a nun. Instead, she lost her faith when she was 14 and by her early 40s had become Mother Superior of the new belief called existentialism, a humanist response to the devastation of World War II. In fact, there was little “new” about it, except in France. There its theorists—Jean-Paul Sartre, Beauvoir and Maurice Merleau-Ponty—freely pillaged German philosophy from Hegel to Martin Heidegger and Edmund Husserl and called it their own. Unlike his fellow-philosophers, Sartre’s real gift was that of a publicist. His slick formula for existentialism—“Existence precedes essence”—popularized a dynamic for all human action, in which “contingency,” or chance, rolled the dice.<br />Beauvoir’s passionate life began early, and chance was on her side. Her father’s financial losses after World War I forced the family into poverty and crammed them together into small, smelly quarters. But the parents’ compensation was social status, and so the girls were admitted to a fashionable convent school, the Cours Adeline Désir. It was here, on her first day of class, that Simone, at age 9, fell in love."
