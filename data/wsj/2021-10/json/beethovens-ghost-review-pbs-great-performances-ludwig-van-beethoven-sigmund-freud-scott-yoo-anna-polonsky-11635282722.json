    "body": "The series “Now Hear This,” part of the PBS institution “Great Performances,” has been what one might call stealthily educational: The music can be so distractingly delicious that you might not notice you’re learning something, about either the life, work and techniques of the great composers, or how performers approach their music.<br />Having devoted programs to Bach, Handel, Scarlatti and Mozart (and my favorite, last autumn’s “The Schubert Generation”) it seems inevitable that host Scott Yoo would aim his violin and expertise at Ludwig van Beethoven, resulting in eloquent interpretations—notably by pianist Anna Polonsky, who awes. What’s unexpected is the close-to-goofy conceit with which writer, director and producer Harry Lynch has framed the episode."
