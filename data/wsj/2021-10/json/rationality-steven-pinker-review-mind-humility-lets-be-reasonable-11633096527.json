    "body": "‘Tell people there’s an invisible man in the sky who created the universe,” the comedian George Carlin once observed, “and the vast majority will believe you. Tell them the paint is wet, and they have to touch it to be sure.”<br />Carlin’s quip is one of many in Steven Pinker’s “Rationality,” an engaging analysis of the highest of our faculties and perhaps (ironically) the least understood. Rational thinking, as Mr. Pinker defines it, is “the ability to use knowledge to attain goals.” True, he notes, those goals themselves—not just material sustenance or health but love, kindness and just a little crazy fun now and then—need not be rationally based. But we must use reason to choose among them when they conflict. Nor do the means to attain those goals always have to be rational; custom, tradition and taboo all have a role."
