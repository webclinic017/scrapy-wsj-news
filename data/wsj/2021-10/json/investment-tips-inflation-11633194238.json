    "body": "Fears of rising prices have ignited interest in Treasury inflation-protected securities as a way to hedge against inflation.<br />A popular approach to investing in TIPS has been through mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. This year through Aug. 31, about $47 billion poured into ETFs and open-ended bond funds with inflation protection as their themes, Morningstar Inc. reports. That is up from $8.3 billion in net inflows during the same period in 2020. That has pushed total net assets in this class of funds and ETFs to more than $266 billion."
