    "body": "Want a bargain ride? Hail a taxi. Ride-share pricing might never be quite as accessible as it once was.<br />For U.S. consumers,  Uber  and  Lyft  rides have been infamously expensive for most of the pandemic. Ride-hailing companies have attributed much of the added cost to a driver shortage, which they recently made a big and expensive push to solve. But even as driver supply has improved, prices arenâ€™t yet back to pre-pandemic levels. They might not get there."
