    "body": "SOME PEOPLE write books, others can paint. Tristan Van Drine is a maestro of posing. On his TikTok account, the 21-year-old Torontonian has posted dozens of videos—sometimes as many as two a day—in which he does nothing but stand in his apartment and demonstrate the “best photo poses.” There’s the “Collar Touch,” the “Lean Back” and the “Crossed Arm.” Each video takes viewers through about four of these poses, each executed with studied insouciance. His account has over 345,000 followers and some videos have amassed over a million views.<br />For the most part, Mr. Van Drine does not invent these poses. Instead he recreates poses he’s seen other people strike for the outfit pictures (or “fit pics”) they take of themselves and post on social media sites like Pinterest and Instagram. (The term “fit pic” describes an image documenting what a person is wearing from head to toe.) Mr. Van Drine splices the original fit pics he’s echoing into his videos, captioning them with cheeky, descriptive names like “Falling Man,” “Shoe Grab” and “Twister.” (According to him, the mimicked posers don’t seem to mind, and some have even giddily commented “that’s me!” on his videos.)"
