    "body": "Thriving entrepreneurship is critical to a strong and growing economyâ€”and especially to the post-Covid recovery. But the incentive to take the personal and financial risk of launching a company is now under threat.<br />The Platform Competition and Opportunity Act, introduced in June by Reps. Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.) and Ken Buck (R., Colo.), would restrict and in some cases ban the acquisition of startups by larger companies. Ostensibly, the goal is to foster competition by preventing dominant online platforms from expanding their sway through acquisitions. But the legislation risks hurting the startups it aims to benefit."
