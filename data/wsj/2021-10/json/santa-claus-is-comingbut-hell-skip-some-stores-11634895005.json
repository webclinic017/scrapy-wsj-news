    "body": "“It came without ribbons. It came without tags. It came without packages, boxes or bags.”<br />Christmas came to Whoville, despite the Grinch’s efforts to steal it, and it will come to the U.S. this year, despite all the supply-chain and staffing problems the pandemic has brought on. Those boxes and bags will cost more, though, helping the best-positioned retailers avoid markdowns and offset spiraling costs. Americans will grit their teeth and pay up and, when they can’t find just the right physical item, they will opt for more virtual ones—digital games, gift cards and subscriptions."
