    "body": "When Joachim Rudolph and his family left their farm in eastern Germany in February 1945, young Joachim had no way of knowing they were on the run, or that escape would become a defining theme of his life. As Helena Merriman recounts in “Tunnel 29: The True Story of an Extraordinary Escape Beneath the Berlin Wall,” what Joachim’s father couldn’t tell him, “because how do you tell a six-year-old any of this,” was that they were fleeing “from the Red Army. He’d heard about them last night on the radio, the Russian soldiers coming from the East, raping women and torching farms,” and he was desperate to get his family to Berlin before the Russians found them.<br />The Russians, however, were “only a day’s ride behind,” and as they overtook the Rudolph family and “millions of refugees like them,” the troops only stopped long enough to rape the women and take away the men—among them Joachim’s father, who will die in the Gulag. Stunned at how quickly their idyllic farm life had become a war-torn nightmare, Joachim, his mother and sister retreat back to their village, which they find already occupied by slightly kinder Russian officers."
