    "body": "Japan’s new Prime Minister Fumio Kishida dissolved the lower house of Parliament Thursday, setting elections for Oct. 31. The contest will focus on the pandemic and economy, but the most notable proposal from Mr. Kishida’s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) may be its pledge to double defense spending.<br />Japan unofficially caps military expenditures at 1% of gross domestic product, some $50 billion annually, and its outlays are close to that figure. But the LDP, which is favored to retain power, has set a goal of 2% of GDP. That’s a huge rise but still below the global average in 2020 of about 2.4%, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute."
