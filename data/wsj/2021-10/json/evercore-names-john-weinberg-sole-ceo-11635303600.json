    "body": "Evercore Inc.  is naming John Weinberg as its sole chief executive, five years after recruiting the former  Goldman Sachs  Group Inc. banker—and scion of a Wall Street dynasty—to the investment bank.<br />Ralph Schlosstein, who has held the job since 2009 and shared it for the past year with Mr. Weinberg, will step down in February. The handoff is the last step in a yearslong leadership transition in which the firm’s founder, Roger Altman, a fixture on Wall Street and Washington for four decades, gradually stepped back."
