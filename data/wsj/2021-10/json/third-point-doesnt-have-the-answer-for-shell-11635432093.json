    "body": "Third Point is right that  Royal Dutch Shell  is undervalued, but splitting up the company isn’t a great solution.<br />The activist investor launched a campaign to break up the European energy giant into lower-carbon and legacy businesses on Wednesday. It believes a split would add value by creating simpler investment propositions and more focused businesses. Shell rejected the plan when it reported third-quarter results on Thursday, arguing that its businesses can do more together, even if a breakup might provide a short-term pop. It is a classic but fair defense."
