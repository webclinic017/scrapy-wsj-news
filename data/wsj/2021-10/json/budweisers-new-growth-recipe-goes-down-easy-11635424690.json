    "body": "For the first time in a long time, a Budweiser looks more appealing than a Heineken.<br />The world’s biggest beer company,  Anheuser-Busch InBev ,  released unexpectedly strong third-quarter results on Thursday. The Bud brewer sold 3.4% more beer in the three months through September compared to the same time last year and it was the seventh consecutive quarter when sales were above analyst expectations, according to FactSet. AB InBev also increased the lower end of its 2021 profit guidance despite higher bills for commodities and transport."
