    "body": "The Cyberspace Solarium Commission, which assesses U.S. strategy for cybersecurity, warned in its 2020 report that “our country is at risk not only from a catastrophic cyberattack, but from millions of daily intrusions disrupting everything from financial transactions to the inner workings of our electoral systems.”<br />These risks are grave and require swift multilateral action. The Biden administration’s 30-nation summit on the scourge of ransomware earlier this month is a great example of what needs to be done. But solely focusing on disrupting the illicit activities of cyber transgressors won’t create the digitally enabled world we want."
