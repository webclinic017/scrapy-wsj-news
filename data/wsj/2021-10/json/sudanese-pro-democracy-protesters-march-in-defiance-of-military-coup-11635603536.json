    "body": "Sudanese security forces fired bullets and tear gas into throngs of protesters Saturday, trying to disperse mass demonstrations against a military coup that has disrupted the countryâ€™s fragile transition to democracy following the ouster of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir.<br />Western diplomats and the United Nations had urged the military to let the demonstrations go ahead peacefully. But the Sudanese doctors union, which has supported the pro-democracy protests, said security forces started firing live bullets into crowds gathered in the city of Omdurman, across the Nile River from the capital, Khartoum."
