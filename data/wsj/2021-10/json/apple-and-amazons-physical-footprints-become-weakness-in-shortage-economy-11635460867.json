    "body": "There’s some painful irony to the fact that the world’s two largest tech companies by annual revenue can’t just rely on moving ones and zeros.<br />Apple Inc.  and  Amazon . com both reported disappointing results for the September quarter late Thursday. Revenue and operating income for both came in below Wall Street’s forecasts. Amazon also projected lower-than-expected results for the fourth quarter, while Apple—which still refrains from giving specific forecasts—said supply constraints would be worse in the December quarter compared with the just-ended period. The two stocks both fell about 4% following their reports."
