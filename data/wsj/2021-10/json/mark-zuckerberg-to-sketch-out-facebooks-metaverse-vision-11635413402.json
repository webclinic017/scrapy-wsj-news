    "body": "Facebook Inc.  Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is expected Thursday to offer a more detailed vision of the metaverse, an online virtual realm where people would work, play and shop that he sees as key to the company attracting younger users.<br />The metaverse, he said earlier this week, would be a leading theme at the social-media giant’s annual developer forum called Facebook Connect, as he urged people to tune in to the online event, which is open to the public. Mr. Zuckerberg is scheduled for a keynote talk, to be followed by other speakers including John Carmack, consulting technology chief of the company’s Oculus virtual-reality business who is known for his past work on hit videogames such as “Doom” and “Quake.”"
