    "body": "The argument that allowing Medicare to negotiate for lower prescription-drug prices will inhibit pharmaceutical manufacturers’ ability to invest in research and development of new lifesaving drugs isn’t based in reality (“Medicare Drug Debate Weighs Price, Innovation,” U.S. News, Oct. 12).<br />A study published in Health Affairs, a peer-reviewed health-research publication, found that the revenue from the top 20 best-selling prescription drugs in the U.S. more than covers all the R&D costs of the 15 pharmaceutical companies that manufacture those drugs. Meanwhile, nine of the 10 largest drug companies spend more on marketing their products than on research. They also pay their executives exorbitant salaries."
