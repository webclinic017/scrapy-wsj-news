    "body": "The Biden Justice Department last week filed its first major antitrust lawsuit, which seeks to dissolve  JetBlue ’s  alliance in the Northeast with  American Airlines .  Perhaps the antitrust cops, like President Biden, only ride Amtrak because they don’t seem to care that the partnership increases competition and helps consumers.<br />Mr. Biden took aim at airline consolidation in his antitrust executive order this summer. But airlines have never been hugely profitable, and consolidation has provided economies of scale and cut costs. Competition from upstart JetBlue has spurred the big three legacy carriers—United, American and Delta—to reduce fares. Ticket prices on average fell by an inflation adjusted 26% between 1999 and 2019."
