    "body": "The investing platform operated by Public Holdings Inc. is rolling out cryptocurrency trading, joining rivals such as  Robinhood Markets Inc.  in the digital-currency space.<br />The move marks an expansion for Public.com, which launched in 2019. Previously, individual investors who used the platform could trade only U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds. Unlike competitors including Robinhood, the company doesnâ€™t allow options or margin trading, two strategies considered more risky for investors."
