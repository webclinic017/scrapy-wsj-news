    "body": "The New Orleans-based Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which last week allowed Texas’ restrictive abortion law to remain in effect in the face of a federal challenge, promises to be a legal battleground for a host of Biden administration initiatives in the years ahead.<br />The Fifth Circuit, one of the nation’s leading conservative courts, covers the states of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. It has 17 active judges, 12 of whom are Republican appointees, including six placed on the court by former President Donald Trump. An array of hot-button cases are likely to land on the court’s docket as Republicans including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and conservative groups challenge administration policies."
