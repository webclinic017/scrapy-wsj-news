    "body": "Hartford, Conn.<br />Contrary to conventional wisdom, women not only became artists in the Renaissance and Baroque periods, but some also thrived. They counted kings, queens, popes and nobles as patrons. Some gained fame; some were elected into exclusive academies; some supported their families. But they were ignored by art history. In recent decades, a few—especially Artemisia Gentileschi—have gained some recognition in monographic exhibitions, but many more early female artists remain obscure."
