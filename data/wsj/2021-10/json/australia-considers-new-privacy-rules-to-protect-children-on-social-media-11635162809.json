    "body": "SYDNEY—Australia is considering new data-privacy rules that could make it illegal for social-media companies to direct children to harmful content, the latest move by lawmakers around the world to address concerns about the impact of online platforms on young people’s mental health.<br />Australia’s government on Monday released draft legislation that would enable the creation of a binding online-privacy code for tech companies. The legislation is expected to be introduced in Australia’s parliament early next year, one government official said. If passed, Australia’s privacy regulator would oversee the development of a code within 12 months, with input from the tech industry."
