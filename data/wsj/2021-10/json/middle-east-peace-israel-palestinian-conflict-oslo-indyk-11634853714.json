    "body": "In “Kissinger Knew That Middle East Peace Couldn’t Be Rushed” (Review, Oct. 16), Martin Indyk claims that an incremental approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will work where final stage approaches have failed. In so doing he ignores the core issue in the conflict: The Palestinian goal isn’t statehood but the destruction of Israel. Every Palestinian leader has rejected every peace proposal. It has never made a big difference who has been Israeli prime minister or U.S. president, or even the specifics of the plan. There is no room for Jewish self-determination in any form.<br />Peace can come only when the Palestinian leadership gives up its dream of dismantling Israel. It also needs to accept the population exchange that followed the failed 1948 Arab invasion of Israel. While Israel uplifted all the Jewish refugees from Arab countries, descendants of Arab refugees haven’t been afforded similar opportunities in most Arab countries."
