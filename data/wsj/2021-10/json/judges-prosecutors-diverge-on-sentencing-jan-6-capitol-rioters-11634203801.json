    "body": "WASHINGTON—Federal prosecutors have sought to calibrate punishments for some of the more than 650 people charged in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, using a formula that weighs how long they were in the building, what they said on social media, whether they cooperated with law enforcement and whether they showed remorse.<br />But judges beginning to hand down sentences have voiced their own ideas about what punishments are just. In sentencing five defendants in Washington this week—the most since the riot—judges imposed both stiffer and more lenient punishments than those the government recommended."
