    "body": "China is preparing to sell U.S. dollar bonds, in a test of investor appetite after data showed the world’s second-largest economy is cooling rapidly.<br />The country’s Ministry of Finance appointed 14 banks, including both international and domestic firms, to run the bond sale, according to notices sent Monday to investors. This would be the fifth year in a row that China has raised billions of dollars with a fall sale of debt in the international bond markets."
