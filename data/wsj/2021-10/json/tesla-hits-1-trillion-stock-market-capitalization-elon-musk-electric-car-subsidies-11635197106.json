    "body": "Elon Musk struck gold again Monday when  Tesla Inc.,  the electric-car maker he founded and runs as CEO, reached a stock market capitalization of $1.03 trillion. That’s a staggering business achievement, even discounting for today’s monetary-policy induced surge in asset prices.<br />Tesla’s 12.7% Monday price leap was triggered by news that Hertz will buy 100,000 Tesla Model 3 cars for its rental fleet. Tesla only produced about half a million cars in all of 2020. The Model 3 sells for about $40,000. The Hertz purchase will broaden public awareness of Tesla’s vehicles, enhancing its chances to become a mass-market brand rather than a virtue-signaling indulgence of the affluent."
