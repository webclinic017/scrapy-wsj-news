    "body": "Amid a border surge, pandemic and inflation, here’s one problem that isn’t (yet) weighing on the U.S. political system: an energy crisis. In Europe energy prices have risen by a factor of five in the last year, and Vladimir Putin is exploiting the situation for Russia’s gain. It’s a reminder that America’s energy production is a source of strategic strength that it risks trading away for climate dreams.<br />Europe’s energy system, which has sought to banish domestic fossil fuels, has left the Continent vulnerable to the global surge in oil and gas prices. The Financial Timesreports that “the strength of the wind blowing across northern Europe has fallen by as much as 15 per cent” in 2021. That’s reduced the productivity of European wind farms and increased reliance on natural gas, of which Russia is the main supplier."
