    "body": "Regarding your editorial “The Final Days at Trump Justice” (Oct. 8): The leaked letter drafted by Assistant Attorney General Jeff Clark did not urge state legislatures to “meet and choose their own slates of presidential electors for the Electoral College.” The draft marked “Pre-Decisional and Deliberative” urged Georgia’s legislature—as a template for “relevant” states—to meet in order to “take additional testimony, receive new evidence, and deliberate” on sworn allegations of electoral irregularities. It further explained the special role that the Constitution gives to state legislatures in the electoral process.<br />Even Americans who believe (as I do) that President Biden won by a wide margin should still want processes designed to ensure election integrity to be followed properly. Nothing in Mr. Clark’s draft suggests any other intention. Mr. Clark, an honorable public servant with whom I served in the Trump administration, appears to have been providing legal analysis for various contingencies in work product that was and remains privileged. For this Mr. Clark now faces a scurrilous ethics complaint. But it is those who leaked the letter and have otherwise broken attorney-client and executive privilege who should be facing ethics complaints. That is the real scandal in this story, which, as the editorial board rightly suggests, is otherwise one of “mostly honorable advisors and resilient institutions.”"
