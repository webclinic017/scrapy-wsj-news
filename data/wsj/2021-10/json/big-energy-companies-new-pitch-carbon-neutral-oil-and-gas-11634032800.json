    "body": "Some energy companies are giving fossil fuels a carbon-neutral makeover, raising concerns that the pitch could undermine the case for less emissions.<br />The companies are selling fossil fuels bundled with carbon offsets and marketing the products as carbon neutral. While they acknowledge that the offsets alone aren’t enough to stop climate change, advocates of decarbonization say the offerings risk exaggerating the climate benefits."
