    "body": "The Biden administration’s $1 trillion “infrastructure plan” has generated controversy, but few doubt that America is in need of repair. President Biden’s words resonated when he claimed that “America is 13th in the world in infrastructure.”<br />Included in the bipartisan package are broadband-deployment subsidies. Mr. Biden asked for $100 billion. The Republicans and Democrats compromised at $65 billion in the “Infrastructure 1” package. Most of that, $42 billion, is slotted for subsidies to rural communications networks, promising to conquer the “digital divide.”"
