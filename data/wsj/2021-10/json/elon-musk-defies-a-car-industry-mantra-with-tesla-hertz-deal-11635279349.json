    "body": "Sales to rental-car fleets have at times been viewed as a liability for auto makers. Elon Musk is defying that stigma, with  Tesla Inc.’s  deal to supply cars to  Hertz Global Holdings Inc.  signaling electric vehicles are ready for the masses.<br />Tesla has added roughly $109 billion to its market capitalization since Hertz said it had ordered 100,000 vehicles to be delivered by the end of next year. That share-price surge helped Tesla become the latest U.S. company to cross $1 trillion in market value."
