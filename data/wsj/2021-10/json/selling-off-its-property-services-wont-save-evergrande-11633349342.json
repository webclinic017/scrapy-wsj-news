    "body": "Evergrande’s potential deal to sell its profitable property management unit may buy it a little breathing space for now. How much oxygen will ultimately be left for investors remains highly uncertain.<br />Trading in the shares of the heavily indebted Chinese developer and its property services unit were suspended Monday pending the announcement of a potential deal.  Evergrande Property Services  said it may announce a general offer for its shares. Also Monday, fellow Chinese developer Hopson Development said it would announce an acquisition of shares in another Hong Kong-listed company. Unconfirmed Chinese media reports said Hopson is looking to buy Evergrande’s property services unit."
