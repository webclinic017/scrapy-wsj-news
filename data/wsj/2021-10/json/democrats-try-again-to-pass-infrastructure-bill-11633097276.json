    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden met with Democrats at the Capitol as the party worked to forge an agreement between its moderate and progressive wings on a social policy and climate package and break an impasse over a separate $1 trillion infrastructure bill.<br />House Democratic leaders had planned on bringing the public works legislation up for a vote on Thursday, but a progressive rebellion against the central element of President Biden’s agenda forced lawmakers to push the vote to Friday. Progressive Democrats are insisting that the party first unite around and pass the social policy and climate proposal, using their threat to oppose the infrastructure bill as leverage in the separate negotiation with other Democrats."
