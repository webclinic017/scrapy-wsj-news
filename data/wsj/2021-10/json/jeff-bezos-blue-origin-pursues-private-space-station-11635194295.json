    "body": "Jeff Bezos’ space company said it would help to build a new space station, part of a growing bet by entrepreneurs and companies that many future orbital facilities will be privately owned and operated.<br />Blue Origin LLC said Monday it is working with a unit of Sierra Nevada Corp.,  Boeing Co.  and others to create a station that is meant to become operational in its initial form in the latter half of this decade. The planned facility, called Orbital Reef, will aim to generate revenue from government agencies and private-sector customers including entertainment companies and manufacturers, executives said during a briefing."
