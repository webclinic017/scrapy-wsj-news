    "body": "The pandemic-driven boom for the personal-computer business is over. The big question now is where the market settles.<br />Global PC sales averaged around 265 million units annually in the five-year period before the pandemicâ€™s onset in 2020, according to IDC. That number jumped to 302.6 million units in 2020, as the pandemic sent workers and companies rushing to gear up for working at home. The rush continued well into this year, which IDC expects to end with more than 340 million PC units shipped."
