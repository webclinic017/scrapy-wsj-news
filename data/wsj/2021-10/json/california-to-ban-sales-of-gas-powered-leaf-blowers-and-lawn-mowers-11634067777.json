Gavin Newsom.<br />The Democrat also on Saturday signed a bill mandating that stores have gender-neutral toy and child-care aisles and another that requires students to take an ethnic-studies class before graduating high school, ahead of a Sunday deadline to approve or veto bills passed in the legislative session that ended in September."
