    "body": "WASHINGTON—Disagreements on tax increases and healthcare proposals have taken center stage in Democrats’ talks to finalize their roughly $2 trillion social policy and climate framework, with President Biden and top lawmakers meeting again to work through remaining snags.<br />Top Democrats hope to nail down an outline for the legislation in the coming days, racing to meet an Oct. 31 deadline to vote on a separate, roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill. Democrats have tied together the House passage of the public-works bill with an agreement on the social policy and climate package, a delicate two-step that has taken months."
