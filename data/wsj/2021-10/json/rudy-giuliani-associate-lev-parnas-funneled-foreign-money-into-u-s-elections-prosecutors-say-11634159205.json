    "body": "The criminal trial of former Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas kicked off in a New York federal court Wednesday with prosecutors describing him as a Florida businessman who promoted his political connections while working to funnel foreign money into U.S. elections in 2018.<br />Mr. Parnas, who faces six counts of campaign-finance charges, is accused of conspiring with Andrey Kukushkin, a co-defendant in the case, to make more than $25,000 in political contributions in a calendar year with funds from Russian businessman Andrey Muraviev. Federal-election laws prohibit foreign nationals from making political contributions in U.S. elections. It is also illegal to make a political contribution in another personâ€™s name."
