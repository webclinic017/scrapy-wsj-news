    "body": "BERLIN—Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said he would step down following accusations of corruption less than two years after his re-election.<br />Mr. Kurz’s departure is the latest blow for conservatives in Western Europe, who have been struggling in recent years. Germany’s Christian Democratic Union lost a national election last month after leading the government for the past 16 years under Chancellor Angela Merkel. Conservatives are in the opposition from France to Spain and Portugal."
