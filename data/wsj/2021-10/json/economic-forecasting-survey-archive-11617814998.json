    "body": "For more than 35 years, The Wall Street Journal’s Economic Forecasting Survey has helped readers better understand the direction of the U.S. economy by publishing consensus forecasts from a panel of academic, business and financial economists. On this page, you’ll find general information about the survey, details on how often and when we conduct it, plus links to stories and downloadable archival data in Excel spreadsheets.<br />The survey’s frequency has changed over time. As of April 2021, we conduct it quarterly—in January, April, July and October. From the mid-1980s through 2002, its frequency was twice a year. From 2003 through March 2021, we conducted it monthly."
