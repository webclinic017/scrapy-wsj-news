    "body": "Former President Donald Trump’s push to relitigate the results of the 2020 election has become a focal point in the closely watched Virginia governor’s race between Republican Glenn Youngkin and Democrat Terry McAuliffe.<br />With recent polls showing their race essentially tied, Mr. McAuliffe has made the issue a key plank of his case against Mr. Youngkin, tying the Republican nominee to the former president and his unsupported claims of widespread voter fraud. Mr. Trump’s claims helped spark the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. Mr. Youngkin has highlighted Democrats’ questioning of the results of the 2000 presidential race and the 2018 Georgia governor contest."
