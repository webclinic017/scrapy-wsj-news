    "body": "ROMEâ€”Italians returned to their workplaces Friday needing to show proof that they have received a Covid-19 vaccine, tested negative or recovered from the virus, a policy that has touched off protests and could provide a preview of a similar mandate planned by the Biden administration.<br />In one of the toughest anti-Covid-19 regimes in the Western world, Italy will require all private and public sector workers to have a so-called green pass. The policy has kicked in amid unresolved questions on how it will be enforced and whether Italy will have enough testing kits to meet the expected surge in demand by millions of unvaccinated people who want to guarantee access to their workplace."
