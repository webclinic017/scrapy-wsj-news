    "body": "Asia’s junk-bond market suffered through another wave of selling Thursday, pushing prices of many Chinese developers’ bonds further into distressed territory.<br />Prices of U.S. dollar bonds of many Chinese property companies gapped lower by around five points, according to several market participants.
