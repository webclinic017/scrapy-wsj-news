    "body": "Four New York City teachers have filed a petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to block the city’s vaccine mandate, which requires school employees to be vaccinated to be able to work on Monday.<br />The 12-page petition filed Thursday argues that the mandate violates the teachers’ constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. The teachers’ lawyers say that other city employees are allowed to opt out of the mandate if they submit to weekly Covid-19 tests."
