    "body": "WASHINGTON—A commission formed by President Biden to study potential changes to the Supreme Court expressed concerns over calls to expand the size of the court, with some members warning it would “undermine, rather than enhance” its legitimacy.<br />Documents released Thursday outlined a range of options that the 36-member panel prepared to discuss at a public meeting Friday. The commission is expected to issue a final report in mid-November amid calls by progressives in the Democratic Party to expand the number of seats, a measure Republicans oppose."
