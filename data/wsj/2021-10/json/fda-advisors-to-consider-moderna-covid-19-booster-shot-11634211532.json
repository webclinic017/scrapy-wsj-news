    "body": "Vaccine experts advising the Food and Drug Administration are scheduled to vote on Thursday whether the agency should authorize an extra dose of  Moderna Inc.â€™s  Covid-19 shot, a key step in making booster doses available to millions more people.<br />The FDA, which often follows the recommendation of the advisers, is expected to issue its decision on the Moderna booster in the days after the vote. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will then also weigh endorsing an additional Moderna dose, before it becomes available to the general public."
