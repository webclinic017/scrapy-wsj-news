    "body": "WASHINGTON—Democrats huddled behind closed doors to evaluate Republicans’ proposal for a short-term debt-limit extension into December, as both parties looked to break an impasse ahead of a looming mid-October deadline for the U.S. to continue paying its bills.<br />In a statement after a closed-door meeting with Senate Republicans, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky proposed allowing Democrats to “use normal procedures to pass an emergency debt limit extension at a fixed dollar amount to cover current spending levels into December.” Republicans have previously blocked Democrats’ efforts to raise the debt ceiling, insisting the party use a special process called reconciliation that bypasses Republican involvement."
