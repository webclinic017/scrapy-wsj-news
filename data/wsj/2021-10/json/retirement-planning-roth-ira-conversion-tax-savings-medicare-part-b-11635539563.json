    "body": "As a recent retiree, I am doing yearly Roth conversions from my tax-deferred individual retirement accounts until my required minimum distributions kick in, much as Glenn Ruffenach recommends (“Ask Encore: When to Start Roth Conversions,” Journal Report, Oct. 25). The amount I am converting on a yearly basis is based somewhat on my target incremental federal tax bracket. These conversions also affect Medicare Part B costs. Whereas higher federal taxes are incremental in nature, the Medicare income-related monthly adjustment amount (IRMAA) surcharges aren’t, and one moves to a significantly higher monthly expense if exceeding an IRMAA threshold by only $1 of incremental earnings. Being aware of this unique risk allows me to plan on how much to convert on a yearly basis with a target IRMAA, rather than the incremental federal tax rate.<br />Douglas Propp"
