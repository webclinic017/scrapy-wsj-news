    "body": "After nine months in office, Joe Biden is in trouble. His job approval has fallen nearly 10 points from its high last spring, and Americans have downgraded their assessment of his presidential capacities.<br />It is far too early, however, to write off his administration as a “failed presidency,” as Virginia gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin and other prominent Republicans have begun to do. In recent decades, presidents of both parties—Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama among them—have recovered from dips in their popularity to win re-election. Reagan won in 1984 in a landslide—but his job approval averaged 43% in 1982 and had fallen to 35% by the beginning of 1983, according to Gallup."
