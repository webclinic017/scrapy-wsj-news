    "body": "Joe Biden’s gazillion-dollar federal spendathon is coming up short, not because the opposition won’t take his statesmanlike appeal to “get out of the way” but because the Senate is split 50-50 and Democrats have a microscopic majority in the House. You know what that means. Whenever the Democratic left today can’t build a mandate at the polls, it has an automatic default: Form a mob.<br />No one was surprised when a tiny mob followed Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema into a public bathroom Sunday and recorded a video of her entering and leaving the stall, to hold the senator “accountable”—a word the left has drained of meaning."
