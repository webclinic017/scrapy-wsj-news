    "body": "WASHINGTON—Democrats turned to finalizing the details of President Biden’s $1.85 trillion social-spending and climate framework, with some lawmakers pushing to add measures lowering prescription drug prices and repealing a cap on the state and local tax deduction.<br />The White House released the framework on Thursday in a bid to quickly resolve the push-and-pull between the party’s progressive and centrist members, hoping to show progress on Mr. Biden’s agenda as he headed overseas for a major climate conference."
