    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration will impose new cybersecurity requirements on some railroad and other surface-transit systems, the latest effort by the federal government to compel certain private industries to boost their cyber defenses in the face of proliferating ransomware attacks and other disruptive threats, officials said.<br />Officials said the mandates, which follow new rules on pipeline operators earlier this year, were necessary because of surface-transportation systems’ vital role in the economy, as well as their potential importance to national security."
