    "body": "WASHINGTON—Democrats abandoned plans to include a paid-leave program in their healthcare, education and climate-change bill, according to people familiar with the talks, while a proposed tax on billionaires faced fresh skepticism as the White House attempted to accelerate progress toward a deal.<br />The White House is pushing for Democrats to come together around the bill, expected to cost around $1.75 trillion, by the end of the week, which could also unlock possible passage of a parallel bipartisan infrastructure package that has been held up by progressives in the House. President Biden is set to attend the Glasgow climate conference next week, and the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections end Tuesday, making the White House eager to show progress on the president’s agenda."
