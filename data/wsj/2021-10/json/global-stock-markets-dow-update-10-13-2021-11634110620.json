    "body": "U.S. stock futures ticked up and oil prices stabilized ahead of fresh data on consumer prices and the start of earnings season, both of which are expected to provide insight into whether recent concerns about inflation are warranted.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 added 0.2% Wednesday, pointing to a pause in the broad-market indexâ€™s three-day decline. It is down 0.9% so far this week. Nasdaq-100 futures rose 0.4%, suggesting modest gains for technology stocks after the opening bell."
