    "body": "The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill didnâ€™t discriminate against white and Asian-American applicants in its undergraduate-admissions process, a federal judge ruled Monday, 11 months after the case went to trial.<br />The school was sued in federal court in North Carolina in 2014 by Students for Fair Admissions, a nonprofit group backed by conservative legal activist Ed Blum. That group was also behind an affirmative action lawsuit against the University of Texas at Austin that led to a Supreme Court decision backing the university, and a suit against Harvard University, in which both a district court and appellate court ruled in favor of Harvard."
