    "body": "Food and Drug Administration staffers didn’t take a firm stance on  Moderna Inc.’s  application for a booster dose, indicating there may not be sufficient data to support the extra dose.<br />FDA staff, after reviewing a drugmaker’s application, often weigh whether it should be given a go-ahead. But they also didn’t take a position on  Pfizer Inc.’s  booster request, later granted. FDA staff reviews are part of the normal process before the agency makes a decision whether to clear a product."
