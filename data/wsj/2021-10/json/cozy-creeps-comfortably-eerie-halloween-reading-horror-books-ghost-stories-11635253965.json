    "body": "If you, like me, find the particular pleasures of autumn among the most keenly anticipated of the year, maybe you’ll understand—even share—my reading predilection as Oct. 31 approaches. Just as one hopes for enough chill in the air to justify breaking out the sweater that’s been mothballed since April, one also wants a little chill in one’s reading. Just enough eeriness to make you slightly more conscious of the wind outside the window, or of the darkness around the ring of lamplight inside. Nothing, though, to leave behind the seeds of a nightmare: The real world offers plenty of those as it is.<br />Mystery fiction readers are familiar with the concept of the “cozy mystery”—a category that has no precisely defined boundaries but can be said to contain both the genteel country-house murders of many Agatha Christie novels and the many 21st-century mystery series which combine homicide with eccentric characters in a small-town locale (recipes in the back)."
