    "body": "WASHINGTON—The White House, its climate agenda mired in congressional wrangling, is hoping to show world leaders at the Glasgow climate summit that the U.S. can still meet President Biden’s pledge to dramatically reduce emissions despite recent legislative setbacks.<br />The Biden administration plan includes a series of executive actions it says will make significant progress toward meeting the president’s pledge to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 50% to 52% below 2005 levels by 2030. These include tougher methane rules for oil and gas production that are expected to be announced ahead of the summit, followed by more stringent emissions limits on vehicles later this year."
