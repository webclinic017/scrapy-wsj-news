    "body": "Most Americans had never heard of Moderna until the pandemic. In less than a year, the biotech startup produced the world’s most effective Covid vaccine—exemplifying U.S. leadership in scientific innovation. Now the Biden Administration is showing its gratitude by stabbing the company in the back.<br />Even by Washington norms, the Administration’s double-cross is remarkable. Biden officials in recent weeks have been leaking to the media that they are very unhappy with Moderna for allegedly putting profits over vaccinating the world’s poor."
