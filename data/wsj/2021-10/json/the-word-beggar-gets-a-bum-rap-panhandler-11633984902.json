    "body": "‘Words strain, / Crack and sometimes break, under the burden,” T.S. Eliot wrote. Tell me about it. I always thought beggar was a neutral word that describes people who, well, beg, but several friends criticized me recently for using this word in an article in these pages. They said beggar is a pejorative term that demeans people who ask for money, and that I should have used the word panhandler.<br />Are they right? I found the following on a website called Vocabulary.com: “A beggar is a poor person who asks others, or begs, for money or food. Another word for a beggar is a ‘panhandler,’ although both terms are vaguely offensive. No one wants to be a beggar.”"
