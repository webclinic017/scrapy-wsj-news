    "body": "Paris<br />After almost two years of Covid-induced absence from Paris and Berlin, I returned to the old world to make a surprising discovery: Europe no longer understands the United States.

That uncertainty further complicates the difficult task of recasting the Atlantic alliance for a turbulent new era."
