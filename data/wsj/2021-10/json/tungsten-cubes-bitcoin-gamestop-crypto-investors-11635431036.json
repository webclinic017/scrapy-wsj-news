    "body": "They bought the bitcoin dip. They took  GameStop  to the moon. Now the online investor army has a new favorite thing to buy and hold: small tungsten cubes.<br />Even in a year that has featured dog-meme cryptocurrencies and rappers shilling SPACs, tungsten cubes stand out. They are as inert as they sound: gray, an inch or two on each side and 1.7 times as dense as lead. A major selling point, according to  Amazon.com ’s  product page, is that they are “extremely heavy for their size.”"
