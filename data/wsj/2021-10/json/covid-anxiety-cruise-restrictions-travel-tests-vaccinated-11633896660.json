    "body": "If you think Covid restrictions are onerous, try going on a cruise, as I did recently. The Adriatic coastline was beautiful, and the staff was lovely, but the Covid rules were jarring. We all had to prove we were vaccinated to board. But the cruise line also required that we submit to a daily PCR test and temperature checks and even wear a tracking device—a small medallion on a necklace, tied in to the ship’s computer. Despite all this, we were told to wear masks in all the ship’s common areas, not only indoors but out and during walking tours ashore.<br />I was on Viking, and the rules vary slightly from line to line, but the vaccination and mask requirements are typical on European trips. Making matters even more confusing are the different rules at various ports and for passengers depending on citizenship or residency. The U.K. “red list” rules meant our stop in Montenegro had to be canceled: All British travelers who visit a country on the list are forced into hotel quarantine on returning home, at their own expense. For Americans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s changing list of at-risk countries meant concern over whether travel insurance would be valid."
