    "body": "AUSTIN—Some Texas clinics again began performing abortions later than six weeks Thursday after a federal judge blocked a state law imposing a near ban on the procedure, while others are moving more slowly as legal challenges play out.<br />Whole Woman’s Health, which operates four Texas abortion clinics, said it reached out Wednesday night to women who had been on a waiting list for abortions after being turned away in recent weeks. The Texas Heartbeat Act, also known as SB8, went into effect Sept 1. It prohibits abortions after an embryo’s cardiac activity can be detected, usually around six weeks into a pregnancy."
