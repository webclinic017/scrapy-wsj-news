    "body": "New York<br />Commercial comedies used to be a staple of Broadway, but they’ve become increasingly rare of late. Writers capable of amusing a popular audience are more likely to gravitate toward Hollywood, where the money is better and steadier. So it’s a pleasant surprise to see that Douglas Lyons’s “Chicken & Biscuits,” the third of an unprecedented eight shows by Black playwrights that are set to open on Broadway this season, bills itself as “a feel-good comedy that will feed your soul.” This production, which is extremely well directed by Zhailon Levingston, originated at a theater in Queens but was forced to close after less than two weeks because of the lockdown and is now being remounted with a mostly new cast at the much larger Circle in the Square Theatre. While the play is far from perfect, it delivers on its promise, and if you’re prepared to look past its flaws, you’ll find it to be both amusing and touching."
