    "body": "Your editorial “Dodging the Constitution for a Global Tax” (Oct. 23) is mistaken in arguing that approval of the new Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development tax treaty by statute constitutes an “end-run around the Constitution.” Using a statute to approve and implement this treaty is hardly a “legislative ploy,” and the statutory method would not be questionable in other countries as to whether it is a “proper treaty.”<br />After all, the global trade treaty, the World Trade Organization, was approved by Congress in 1994 using only a statute. A statutory path for undertaking U.S. multilateral tax treaty obligations is not “dodging proper constitutional procedure” because the Constitution grants Congress authority to pass laws “to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.”"
