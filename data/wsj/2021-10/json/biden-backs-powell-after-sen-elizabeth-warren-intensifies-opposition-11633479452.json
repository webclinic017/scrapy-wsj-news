Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) on Tuesday escalated her criticism of the central bank’s leader.<br />“Thus far, yes,” Mr. Biden said when asked by a reporter during a trip to Michigan if he had confidence in Mr. Powell. “But I’m just catching up to some of these assertions,” he said, referring to senior officials’ trading activities that sparked Ms. Warren’s most recent volley of disapproval."
