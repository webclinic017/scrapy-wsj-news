    "body": "In “Robinhood Users Come Under Attack” (op-ed, Sept. 28), Robinhood CEO and co-founder Vlad Tenev tells us that investing should be “delightful,” perhaps like children’s birthday parties, jolly and filled with goodies. All that is required is bringing a present—your savings or hard-earned income. In return, you will get a lot of cool games, cake and maybe you win a prize. The value of the prize may be equal to your gift, or it may be less or in fact it may be worthless.<br />Mr. Tenev claims that questioning and seeking to regulate investors’ choices insults their intelligence. In this story, regulators are the mean grown-ups. They want to explain the rules of each game and the actual value of the prize: Party poopers!"
