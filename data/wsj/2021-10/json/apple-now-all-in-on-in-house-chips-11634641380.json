    "body": "Breaking up may be hard to do, but  Apple Inc.  made this one look easy.<br />The new line of MacBook Pro models that Apple announced on Monday are the last of the Mac laptops to get the company’s in-house processor called the M1. That comes less than a year after the company first unveiled the chip, which replaces the Core family from  Intel Corp.  as the computer’s main central processor. At the time, Apple promised that it would move its entire Mac family to its in-house chips “within a couple years.”"
