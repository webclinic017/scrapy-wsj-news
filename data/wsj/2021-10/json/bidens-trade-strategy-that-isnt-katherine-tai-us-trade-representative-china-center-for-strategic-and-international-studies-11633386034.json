    "body": "Whatever the flaws of President Trump’s trade strategy with China, at least he had one. President Biden’s is indiscernible, judging from the much-anticipated but content-free remarks Monday by U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.<br />Ms. Tai said that China had failed to abide by the terms of the Trump Administration’s phase one deal, which included commitments on intellectual property, technology transfer, purchases of American products, and improved market access for agriculture and financial services. In what areas specifically was China failing? She didn’t say."
