    "body": "There’s one problem with the stream of reporting likening the new Donald Trump digital startup to “meme stocks” such as  GameStop  or the AMC movie chain, whose share prices exceed what even the most forgiving Wall Street analysts are willing to rationalize.<br />Meme stocks, in this newspaper’s pithy summary, are those that “become wildly popular among online traders for reasons other than their business prospects.” But the new Trump business, currently known as  Digital World Acquisition Corp. , is a startup. It has no existing business to analyze, only its unknown potential. Thus there’s no real basis for leaping to the assumption that the market is merely irrational in valuing the company between $2 billion and $8 billion, the trading range it has occupied since debuting a week ago."
