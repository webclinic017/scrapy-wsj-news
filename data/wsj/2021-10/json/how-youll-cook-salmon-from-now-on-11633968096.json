    "body": "MEMORIES OF A MEAL in France plus time cooking at Gramercy Tavern in New York inspired this crisp-skinned, super-supple salmon from Joe Papach of the Harvey House in Madison, Wis. Served here with roasted beets, watercress, cucumbers and dill it’s the chef’s third Slow Food Fast recipe.<br />Mr. Papach sears the fish skin-side down, then lowers the temperature and bastes the flesh in olive oil and butter infused with garlic and thyme. “This approach gives a better texture,” said the chef. “The salmon is still flaky but the meat is tender, with an almost melting texture.”"
