    "body": "WASHINGTON—The clock is ticking for Congress to reach a long-term deal to raise the federal borrowing limit, or debt ceiling, before the government runs out of money to pay its bills.<br />The ceiling was suspended in 2019 and was reinstated automatically at the beginning of August. Top Republicans said they wouldn’t help Democrats raise the limit this year, leading to a showdown in Congress. In October, party leaders reached a deal to extend the debt ceiling until early December, and the Senate and House then approved the short-term deal, averting default for the moment."
