    "body": "MANY MEN FEAR colorful clothes. They’ll sprinkle in the rare cayenne sweater or canary button-up but mainly stick to safe tans and pale grays. Joshua Safran is not one of these men.<br />The TV writer and producer (currently the showrunner of HBO Max’s “Gossip Girl” reboot) has dressed in head-to-toe, single-hue looks for about five years. Starting with modest monochrome outfits of steady blues, he eventually upped the ante, adopting matching sets in jolting shades such as lemon-yellow and burgundy. He is so committed to the cause that he has considered purchasing color-synced underwear. Color-matching is “something that brings me a lot of joy,” said Mr. Safran, 47."
