    "body": "Banks rushed to work with the Apple Pay mobile wallet when it debuted in 2014. They have some regrets.<br />When Apple Pay launched, the tech giant got big banks including  JPMorgan Chase  & Co.,  Capital One Financial Corp.  and  Bank of America Corp.  to agree to pay fees that would allow their cardholders to pay by iPhone.
