    "body": "If you want to understand the man Colin Powell was, the thing to remember is that his hobby was repairing old Volvo cars.<br />The passion for car repairs was a vestige of his working-class background, and a metaphor for the everyman approach he brought to positions of power. In a 1990s interview, he said he had bought, repainted, repaired and resold some 30 Volvos, a practice begun when he revived one so his son could have a car in college."
