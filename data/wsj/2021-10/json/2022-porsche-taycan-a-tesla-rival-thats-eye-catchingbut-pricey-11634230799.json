I’m only a witness to an industry, a surrogate for you, dear reader, driving machines you may not get a chance to.<br />Consider our test car, with a name worthy of the AKC Registry: the 2022  Porsche  Taycan Turbo S Cross Turismo (hereinafter TTSCT, if it pleases the court). This gorgeously malevolent, deeply desirable electric multitasker is aimed at a select few. Of this particular pedigree—the Taycan (electric supersports four-door, introduced in 2019), Turbo S (dual-motor AWD, 750 hp max), Cross (with “Gravel” mode!) Turismo (hatchback)—Porsche will import fewer than 1,000 copies to North America. While the base price is $187,600, our fully laden spaceship rang up $208,650 at the register. Now that’s what I call a carbon offset."
