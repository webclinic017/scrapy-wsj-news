    "body": "HONG KONG—Amnesty International said it will pull out of Hong Kong by the end of the year, marking one of the most prominent departures of a civil-rights group since China’s imposition of a sweeping new security law on the city.<br />The London-based rights group said it will close two offices in the city, including a regional base. It cited the security law, which took effect in June 2020, saying the legislation was vague and being used by authorities to restrict freedom of expression and repress political opposition."
