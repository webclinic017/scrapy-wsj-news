    "body": "Hawks and doves both had high hopes for U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai’s long-awaited speech Monday on the Biden administration’s China trade agenda. Both were disappointed. The most likely outcome over the next year remains a continuation of the status quo: a frozen conflict.<br />While the U.S. Trade Representative didn’t announce any new tariffs or investigations, she left the door open, saying that the administration intended to enforce the Phase One trade deal negotiated under President Trump. Ms. Tai also, however, also made no mention of scrapping existing tariffs. She did announce a new tariff exclusions process whereby U.S. businesses can apply to skip paying levies in areas where the tariffs are deemed too damaging. Similar processes existed under the Trump administration but expired under Mr. Biden’s."
