    "body": "After Pennsylvania’s 2020 election mess, the state Supreme Court needs an injection of judicial restraint, and Judge Kevin Brobson wants to deliver the first dose. The Nov. 2 ballot includes a partisan election for an open seat on the high court. Judge Brobson, who sits on an appeals bench a step lower, is the GOP nominee. His website says he’ll defend “the law as it is written.”<br />That’s exactly what the state’s Supreme Court did not do last year. State law clearly says mail ballots must be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day. Yet two months before the vote, a 4-3 majority conjured a Covid-19 exception: Mail ballots that arrived three days late would be valid, even without a postmark."
