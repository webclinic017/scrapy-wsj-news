    "body": "Are American food-delivery stocks about to get burned or is all the smoke coming from the kitchen next door?<br />On Wednesday, the new parent company of Grubhub, Amsterdam-based  Just Eat Takeaway.com ,  also known as Jet, provided a third-quarter trading update. While several countries showed stellar growth, Grubhub’s business looked disappointing, setting a negative tone ahead of third-quarter earnings for  DoorDash  and the Uber Eats unit of  Uber Technologies .  One conclusion is that Grubhub’s trends signal an industrywide slowdown for food delivery in the U.S. More likely, Grubhub’s pain is its competitors’ gain."
