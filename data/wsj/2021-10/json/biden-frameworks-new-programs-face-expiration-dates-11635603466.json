    "body": "WASHINGTON—The $1.85 trillion climate and social-spending bill that Democratic lawmakers are negotiating would set up new benefit programs for many Americans, but some come with expiration dates in the near future, throwing into question the provisions’ long-term fates.<br />President Biden’s framework released Thursday funds universal prekindergarten and child-care programs for six years, but others have shorter terms. The outline extends Affordable Care Act cost-sharing assistance through 2025 but funds the enhanced child tax credit for just one additional year at the levels set in the pandemic relief package passed earlier this year."
