    "body": "Edgar Allan Poe came of age in a literal marketplace. Orphaned before age 3, he was informally adopted by John Allan, a trader whose import-export business dealt in consumer goods as well as cotton and tobacco. As a teenager he wrote his first poems on the back of Allan’s business records.<br />Poe is remembered as the inventor of the horror genre, thanks to Halloween-friendly poems and stories like “The Raven” and “The Tell-tale Heart.” But his creative work can be seen as another kind of business enterprise, charting his valiant but often futile attempts to “coin one’s brain into silver.” This makes him an instructive example today, when new technologies mean that creators face some of the very same problems that they did in the 19th century, including an oversupplied market and the proliferation of free content."
