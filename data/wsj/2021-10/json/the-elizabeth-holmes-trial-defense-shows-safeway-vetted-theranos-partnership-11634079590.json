    "body": "SAN JOSE, Calif.—Lawyers for Theranos Inc. founder Elizabeth Holmes sought to show in court Tuesday that Safeway Inc. had responsibility for its failed partnership with the blood-testing startup, describing the grocery chain’s extensive resources and due diligence before inking the deal as evidence that the company wasn’t misled.<br />Ms. Holmes’s lawyers aimed to undercut nearly two days of testimony from former Safeway CEO Steven Burd that he had relied on Ms. Holmes’s promises and claims about Theranos’s technology—many of which never materialized—when it decided to invest more than $350 million in a partnership to turn Safeway stores into Theranos blood-testing sites."
