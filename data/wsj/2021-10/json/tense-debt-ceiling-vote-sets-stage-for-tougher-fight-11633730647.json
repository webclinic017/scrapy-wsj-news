    "body": "WASHINGTON—The suspense over Senate Republicans’ ability to muster the votes needed to end debate on a short-term debt-limit extension Thursday provides a preview of an even tougher fight later this year, when Congress faces a Dec. 3 deadline to avoid default as well as a government shutdown.<br />As part of a deal with Democrats, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) needed to deliver at least 10 GOP votes to get past the 60-vote threshold required to advance a bill temporarily extending the debt ceiling in the 50-50 chamber. Rounding up those votes proved challenging, as Republicans had pledged to force Democrats to raise the debt ceiling themselves and were reluctant to give in."
