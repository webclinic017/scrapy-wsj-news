    "body": "New efforts are under way to eliminate what some toy makers, parents and advocates see as a longstanding issue in the toy industry: gender bias.<br />The notion that boys like blue and play with trucks while girls like pink and play with dolls is a stereotype some in the toy industry have tried to disrupt for years.
