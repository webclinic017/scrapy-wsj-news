    "body": "Regarding “Big Labor and the Supply Shortage” (Review & Outlook, Oct. 18): James P. Hoffa of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters sees “opportunity” in “a new militancy” among union members. Militancy is what unions have always done in times of opportunity; the American trade-union movement has a long history of putting its knee on the neck of commence when such opportunity appears.<br />In 1942 the CIO’s John L. Lewis took the opportunity to take 400,000 coal miners out on strike—in what was one of the coldest winters of the century, despite organized labor’s no-strike pledge during the war. In 1943 there were 13.5 million lost production work days due to strikes and in 1944 there were 4,950 illegal wildcat strikes. In 1946, with millions of GIs trying to get home, 200,000 railroad workers went on strike. Labor unions saw opportunity."
