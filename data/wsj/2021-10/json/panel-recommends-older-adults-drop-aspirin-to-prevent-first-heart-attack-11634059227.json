    "body": "People in their 60s or older shouldn’t take aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke because risks likely cancel out the potential benefits, according to a government-backed panel of medical experts.<br />Heart disease and stroke are leading causes of death in the U.S. An estimated 605,000 people in the U.S. have a first heart attack each year and 610,000 experience a first stroke, according to the American Heart Association. A daily dose of aspirin, a blood-thinner, has been demonstrated to lower the risk of a first heart attack or stroke, but it also can cause harms including bleeding in the stomach, intestines and brain. The risk for bleeding increases with age."
