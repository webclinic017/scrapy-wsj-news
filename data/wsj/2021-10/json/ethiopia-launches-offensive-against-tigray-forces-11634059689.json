    "body": "Ethiopian government forces have launched a renewed assault to recapture the rebellious northern region of Tigray, raising fears of a more devastating humanitarian crisis in a region the United Nations says is already in the grip of famine after a nearly yearlong conflict.<br />Ethiopian ground troops, backed by regional militia from the Amhara region, launched coordinated attacks from multiple fronts along Tigray’s southern border, government and rebel officials said Tuesday. Government troops deployed heavy artillery and tanks—backed by drones and airstrikes—targeted main supply routes and at least three towns of Wegeltena, Geregera and Haro near Tigray’s border with Amhara."
