    "body": "Bill Pollockâ€™s 70 years in charge of the HR and recruitment company he co-founded have seen him manage his way through economic crises, commodity crashes and most recently the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />Mr. Pollock owns and manages Drake International, the Toronto-based agency that helped pioneer the concept of temporary employment contracts when it opened in 1951. Mr. Pollock says he hit upon the idea after seeing seasonal productivity swings at companies he visited while selling bookkeeping machines in the early 1950s. After watching enterprises carry the cost of a full staff load even when business was slow, he and a partner founded Drake to supply temporary workers."
