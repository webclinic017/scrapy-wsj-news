    "body": "Is Kyrsten Sinema the Democrats’ John McCain?<br />In his day the media cheered McCain as a “maverick” who put principle ahead of party. But it turns out the word maverick applies only to Republicans opposing a Republican agenda. As Ms. Sinema’s opposition to Joe Biden’s $3.5 trillion agenda is revealing, a maverick in the Democratic Party elicits far different treatment."
