    "body": "The Lincoln Highway, the first transcontinental road in the U.S.—open for business in 1913—has none of the pop-culture force of Route 66. It didn’t launch a catchy song, a television series or countless family car trips. But things come to those who wait: The twisty old road is the fulcrum of Amor Towles’s twisty—and twee—picaresque novel “The Lincoln Highway,” which is two parts “Sullivan’s Travels” and one part “An American Tragedy.”<br />June 12, 1954, is a red-letter day. Emmett Watson, 18, has just returned to Nebraska from 15 months at a juvenile work farm in Kansas. An unfortunately placed punch in response to the taunts of a local lowlife had led to Emmett’s conviction for involuntary manslaughter and an 18-month sentence. But what with his mother long gone—who knows why and who knows where—and the family farm in foreclosure and his quixotic father recently deceased, he has been sprung early."
