    "body": "By the time Jean Eduver, a private chauffeur, left for work at dawn Wednesday in La Plaine, a flat stretch of shantytowns north of the Haitian capital, kidnappers had already hit his neighborhood multiple times.<br />Overnight, armed bandits broke into a woman’s nearby house, ransacked it and grabbed her 3-year-old child, he said. Another neighbor’s daughter, having just returned from the U.S., was also abducted. And in a neighboring village, kidnappers that morning stopped a young woman taking her two sisters to school and kidnapped all three, Mr. Eduver said."
