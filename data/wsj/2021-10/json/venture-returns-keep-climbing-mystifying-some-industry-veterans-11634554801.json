    "body": "Venture capital funds are reaping the rewards of a booming market as returns continue to improve. But the dizzying climb in startup valuations has some worried that the market euphoria is turning irrational.<br />“It’s going too well. I’m not actually that smart. It can’t continue like this,” said Matt Harris, a partner at Bain Capital Ventures.
