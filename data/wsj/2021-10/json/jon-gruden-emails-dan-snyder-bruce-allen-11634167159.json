    "body": "Before the emails that prompted Jon Gruden to resign as coach of the Las Vegas Raiders became public over the past week, some of them made a little-noticed and redacted appearance in another public forum: a discovery motion Washington Football Team owner Daniel Snyder had filed in April.<br />Snyder sought to learn who had leaked false information to an India-based media outlet that he contended wrongly connected him to Jeffrey Epstein. Snyder’s lawyers asked a U.S. court to compel the production of evidence they wanted: emails, texts and phone records of Bruce Allen, his team’s former president and general manager."
