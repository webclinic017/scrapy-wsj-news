    "body": "SINGAPORE— Fantasia Holdings Group Co. , the real-estate developer whose surprise default this week caused a selloff in U.S. dollar bonds of many Chinese property companies, said Friday that it is working with the support of local governments and others to resolve its problems.<br />Financial markets in mainland China reopened Friday after a weeklong public holiday. Prices of Fantasia’s yuan-denominated bonds plummeted when they resumed trading on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, causing temporary trading halts. One of its bonds with a November 2022 maturity date dropped 53 points to about 44.8 cents on the dollar, according to data provider Wind."
