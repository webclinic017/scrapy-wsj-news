    "body": "Lori Lightfoot was dismissive in June when she called talk of the Chicago Bears moving to the suburbs “a negotiating tactic that the Bears have used before.” But now that the Bears have signed a $197.2 million purchase agreement for land in Arlington Heights, about 30 miles northwest of the Loop, she says the city wants to talk.<br />At a time when her Democratic Party is railing against the wealthy, it sure would be odd if Mayor Lightfoot’s talk were to include a promise to pump more taxpayer dollars into an NFL team that Forbes values at more than $4 billion."
