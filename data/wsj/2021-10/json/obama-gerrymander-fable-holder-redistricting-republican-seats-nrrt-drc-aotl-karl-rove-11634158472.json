    "body": "I guess I should be honored that the National Democratic Redistricting Committee slapped my name and picture on its fundraising email, but am I really “the latest Republican attack on democracy?”<br />The committee’s appeal appeared after former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former New Jersey Gov.
