    "body": "This week about 1,400 workers at  Kellogg  went on strike. One thing is clear: The Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union doesn’t represent Kellogg‘s marketing department. Photos showed a single picketer drawing on his employer’s iconic brands—Frosted Flakes mascot Tony the Tiger declaring “I’m Greedy,” without so much as an extra “r.” For a campaign aimed at a company with products ranging from Rice Krispies to Pop-Tarts, Bear Naked and Cheez-It, it is a missed opportunity.<br />Luckily, the internet rose to the occasion. One commenter on  Twitter  said the strikers “should milk it for all it’s worth.” More than one advised them to “snap, crackle and stop.”"
