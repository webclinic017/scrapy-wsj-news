    "body": "When Democrats say they want to remake the U.S. economy by government fiat, they aren’t kidding. Having banned the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035, California is now coming for chainsaws, weed whackers, lawn mowers, leafblowers and other supposedly dirty off-road equipment.<br />Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday signed legislation directing the state’s Air Resources Board to issue regulations that “prohibit engine exhaust and evaporative emissions from new small off-road engines” by 2024 or “as soon as the state board determines is feasible, whichever is later.” But when there’s a progressive will, the state’s regulators never care if there’s a “feasible” way to comply."
