    "body": "On the cusp of what should be its merriest holiday season yet,  Electronic Arts  has found a few lumps of coal in its stocking.<br />A combination of strong game performance and a recent acquisition spree is giving a boost to the videogame publisher’s business. Net bookings—measuring both game sales and in-game transactions—are expected to total nearly $4.5 billion in the second half of the 2021 calendar year, according to FactSet. That would be up 35% from the same period last year, by far the best projected growth in a sector facing challenging comparisons from a surge in gameplay during lockdowns last year. Six other major game publishers are expected to average flat sales for the same period, according to FactSet’s data. Projected net bookings of $2.7 billion for the December quarter would mark a company record."
