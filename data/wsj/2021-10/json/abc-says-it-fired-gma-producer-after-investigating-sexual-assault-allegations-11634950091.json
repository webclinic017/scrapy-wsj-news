    "body": "Walt Disney Co. ’s ABC said in a legal filing Friday that it fired “Good Morning America” executive producer Michael Corn last April after investigating allegations that he sexually harassed and assaulted two network staffers.<br />“The investigation determined that it was more likely than not that Corn violated ABC’s policies. ABC then promptly terminated Corn’s employment after 17 years of service,” ABC said in a motion to dismiss several claims in a lawsuit against the network filed by Kirstyn Crawford, a producer on “Good Morning America.”"
