    "body": "The move by Texas to bar Covid-19 vaccine mandates by businesses sets up a clash between the state and the Biden administration, leaving employers caught in the middle.<br />On one side, Monday’s executive order from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott forbids any private entity to require its employees or customers to get vaccinated. On the other hand, the Biden administration is working on requirements that private-sector workers be vaccinated or tested weekly at businesses with 100 or more employees."
