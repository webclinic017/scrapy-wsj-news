    "body": "WASHINGTON—White House officials are planning to schedule a virtual meeting between President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in coming weeks, a senior administration official said.<br />National security adviser Jake Sullivan met in Zurich with Chinese Communist Party Politburo member and Director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission Yang Jiechi, where the two discussed a range of issues. Mr. Xi isn’t expected to attend the coming G-20 meeting, so Messrs. Sullivan and Yang discussed the two leaders having a virtual engagement by the end of the year."
