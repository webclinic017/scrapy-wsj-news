    "body": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) ramped up her rhetorical attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday, lamenting what she called a “culture of corruption” at the central bank.<br />Mr. Powell has “failed as a leader,” Ms. Warren said, adding, “Our nation needs leaders who are willing to set and enforce strong ethics standards and who act swiftly when a problem arises,” and in her view, Mr. Powell hasn’t done that."
