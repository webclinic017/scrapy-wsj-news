    "body": "It has been said that more money has been lost in the search for yield than at the point of a gun. Those who have tried to bet against bonds since S&P downgraded America’s credit rating in 2011 have questioned the validity of that maxim as rates have broadly declined and bond prices have risen.<br />It might seem a mystery why investors would accept a negative real return on what is considered the closest thing in the world to a risk-free asset. The answer has a lot to do with the Federal Reserve’s continuing purchase of Treasury bonds, along with the $13 trillion in negative-yielding sovereign debt outstanding globally. In that context, the thinking goes, lending money to Uncle Sam for the next 10 years at 1.5% isn’t that bad a deal."
