    "body": "THREE SUMMERS AGO, my husband, Read, and I planned to meet friends, an Italian couple who live in Emilia-Romagna, on the island of Sardinia for a relaxing weeklong vacation. Our friends, Maddalena and Lorenzo, had insisted they take care of the itinerary. Read and I imagined checking into a nice hotel and dozing on the beach—a much needed reprieve from our jobs in New York. But when we landed in Sardinia—a day late, after an overbooked flight forced us to spend the night in a seedy hotel by JFK airport—Maddalena and Lorenzo greeted us with a surprise: They popped out of an old-style camper van, and told us we were taking a road trip around the island.<br />At first, this sounded like a grand idea. The camper had a charming interior: a little table and lime green bench, a window framed by lace curtains clearly sewn by an Italian grandmother. There was a mattress above the cab and a compact bunk bed in the back, next to the toilet. Our friends had stocked the mini fridge with beers, cheese and charcuterie for the adventure. They opened the wood cabinets to show off the wine glasses and the tiny colander. At the time, eager and jet-lagged as we were, this seemed like everything we could possibly want."
