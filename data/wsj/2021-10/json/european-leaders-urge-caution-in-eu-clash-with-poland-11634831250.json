    "body": "European Union leaders urged Brussels to act cautiously in an escalating fight with Poland’s nationalist government over its judiciary as the bloc’s heads of government gathered Thursday for a summit.<br />The latest fight centers on a ruling by Poland’s constitutional tribunal two weeks ago that EU treaty law has become incompatible with Polish law—an unprecedented ruling from a national court.
