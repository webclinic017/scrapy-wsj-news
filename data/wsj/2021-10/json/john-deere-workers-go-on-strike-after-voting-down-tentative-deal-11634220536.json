    "body": "Deere  & Co. workers went on strike for the first time in 35 years, extending a series of labor disputes at major U.S. companies during a nationwide labor shortage.<br />Work stopped at 12:01 a.m. Thursday at 14 U.S. plants for the farm- and construction-equipment giant, as 10,100 U.S. production workers represented by the United Auto Workers union walked off the job. Deere and union negotiators continue to have discussions and trade ideas, but the next face-to-face bargaining session is not expected until early next week, a person familiar with the matter said."
