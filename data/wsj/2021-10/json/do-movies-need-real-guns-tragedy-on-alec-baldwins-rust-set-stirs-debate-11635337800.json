    "body": "Professionals at every level of the film and television industry are debating the role of real firearms on sets and the risks they bring as the fatal shooting on the Alec Baldwin western “Rust” reverberates.<br />While studios privately say they are re-examining their safety policies, some producers are vowing to stop using guns that fire blank rounds on their own productions. They include ABC cop series “The Rookie” and  Amazon  superhero drama “‘The Boys,” whose lead producer, Eric Kripke, tweeted last Friday, “no more guns with blanks on any of my sets ever.” Family members of Brandon Lee, the actor killed in a gun accident in 1993, are pushing for stricter gun-safety measures across the industry. Others are hoping to get rid of real guns altogether on sets, arguing that replicas get the job done in an era of ever-present visual effects."
