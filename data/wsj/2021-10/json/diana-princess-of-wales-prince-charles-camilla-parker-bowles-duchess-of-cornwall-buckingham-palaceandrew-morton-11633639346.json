    "body": "By rights, Americans ought to be looking at the six-part “Diana” with a cocked brow and a jaundiced eye. The celebrated Princess of Wales, who was killed in 1997 under genuinely tragic circumstances, would have turned 60 in July and remains an object of fascination nearly 25 years after her death. And yet the root cause of all the pain, scandal, anguish and royal adulteries revisited by this CNN series is precisely that monarchical system we shrugged off 238 years ago. If one takes a step back from the emotionally obvious, it’s difficult to regard the story with seriousness, or at least the seriousness with which the documentary regards itself.<br />Celebrity culture is celebrity culture, however, and Diana is Diana. What would have been nice is some perspective."
