    "body": "Senate incumbents in competitive races hold multimillion-dollar campaign cash advantages more than a year out from the 2022 midterms, while fundraising totals were tighter in several closely watched Republican primaries where former President Donald Trump has made endorsements.<br />Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Mark Kelly of Arizona, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Raphael Warnock of Georgia—the four most at-risk Senate Democrats—all had millions of dollars more in their campaign accounts than their Republican challengers at the end of the third quarter, according to reports filed Friday with the Federal Election Commission."
