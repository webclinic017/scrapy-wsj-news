    "body": "WASHINGTON—Democrats in Washington and Virginia are growing anxious as the neck-and-neck Virginia governor race looms Tuesday without a resolution to the negotiations over President Biden’s spending plans.<br />Democrats on Sunday sought to move beyond disappointment over the state of Mr. Biden’s social-spending plan, from which several popular provisions, such as one lowering prescription drug prices, have been discarded amid a long and messy intraparty debate. Party leaders cast the investments as historic and said the public would rally around them once they become law, an acknowledgment of the toll the debate has had."
