    "body": "The ACLU is not alone in replacing the term “women” with “people” (“The ACLU Decides ‘Woman’ Is a Bad Word” by Nicole Ault, op-ed, Oct. 4). The degenderizing has also been adopted by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. It is reflected in redactions of position statements that now identify patients previously called “pregnant women” as “pregnant people,” “persons” or “individuals.”<br />Today, people can select the nominal gender with which they wish to be identified. But having practiced obstetrics for 50 years, delivering more than 10,000 babies, I have yet to see one born to a biological male—rendering the gender de-identification of pregnancy utter nonsense."
