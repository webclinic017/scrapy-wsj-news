    "body": "MOSCOW—Russia is looking to limit spending from its sovereign-wealth fund as the global transition away from fossil fuels threatens the backbone of its economy.<br />President Vladimir Putin has ordered the government to look into raising the threshold for tapping into the $190 billion National Wealth Fund, which holds part of the country’s oil-and-gas proceeds. Currently, authorities are able to invest money from the fund once the liquid part of its assets reaches 7% of gross domestic product. Mr. Putin now wants to raise that level to 10% of GDP, a move that would effectively curtail spending from the fund."
