    "body": "Brotherly love abounds between big labor and Democrats, but in Philadelphia the bond may have been criminal. That’s the allegation in a corruption trial that began Monday in a federal court in Pennsylvania.<br />The case involves John “Johnny Doc” Dougherty, the powerful boss of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 98, and City Councilman Bobby Henon. In 2015 and 2016, as Mr. Henon held office, Local 98 paid him more than $143,000 in salary."
