    "body": "Donald Trump testified under oath Monday for a 2015 lawsuit filed by protesters who accused the then-presidential candidate’s security guards of assault, marking the first time the former president is known to have been deposed since leaving the White House.<br />Benjamin Dictor, a lawyer for the protesters, said Mr. Trump sat for about four and half hours and answered questions about events that occurred outside of Trump Tower on Sept. 3, 2015. In the 2015 lawsuit, a group of activists said they were attacked by Mr. Trump’s security guards while protesting against his comments about immigrants on a sidewalk outside Trump Tower."
