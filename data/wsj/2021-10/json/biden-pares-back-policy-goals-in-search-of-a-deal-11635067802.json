    "body": "WASHINGTON—With a series of deadlines approaching, President Biden’s increased involvement in talks over his sweeping social-policy agenda shows the line he is walking between being a pragmatic deal maker, with hopes of delivering tangible political wins, and his desire to enact transformative, long-term progressive policies.<br />Mr. Biden, a Democrat who spent nearly four decades in the Senate and another eight years as vice president, has sought to balance both goals as he attempts to complete an agreement with progressives and moderates within his party before departing this week for an overseas trip that will include climate talks in Scotland."
