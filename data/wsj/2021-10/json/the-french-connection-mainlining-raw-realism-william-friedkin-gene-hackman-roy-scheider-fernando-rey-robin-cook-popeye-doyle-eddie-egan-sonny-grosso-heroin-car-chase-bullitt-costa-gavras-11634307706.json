    "body": "Fifty years ago this month, William Friedkin’s “The French Connection” set a new benchmark for crime thrillers. The production was budgeted initially at $2 million by Twentieth Century-Fox. This was reduced to $1.5 million at a time of exigency for the studio, and Mr. Friedkin recalls on the 2009 Blu-ray disc from Fox that the film finally cost $1.8 million. It grossed more than $51 million in the U.S., and in the following spring won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture.<br />A compelling reconstruction of a case that had perplexed and preoccupied drug enforcement agencies on a city and national level during the early 1960s, “The French Connection” owed its success not just to the book, by Robin Cook, on which it was based, but to the courage and imagination of Mr. Friedkin, who would achieve world-wide fame with “The Exorcist” two years later."
