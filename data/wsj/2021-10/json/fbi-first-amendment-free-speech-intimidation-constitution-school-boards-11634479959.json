    "body": "Attorney General Merrick Garland’s memorandum instructing the Federal Bureau of Investigation to develop strategies for monitoring “harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence” against local school personnel presents an opportunity for FBI Director Christopher Wray. While Mr. Garland’s order notes in passing that “spirited debate about policy matters is protected under our Constitution,” it is clearly intended to intimidate parents and as such is a threat to their First Amendment rights.<br />Mr. Wray has characterized his own leadership style as “low-key.” Many current and former agents have wished he showed “fire in the belly” in confronting the bureau’s missteps. His response to the Russia-collusion hoax was simply “those responsible are no longer with us.” After the inspector general found multiple errors in the FISA applications against Carter Page, Mr. Wray blandly noted that the opening of the case met the very low standard for a counterintelligence investigation."
