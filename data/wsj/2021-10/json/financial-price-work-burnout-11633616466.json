    "body": "Burnout has a cost—a dollar cost.  In my own life, I’ve learned to recognize the physical cost burnout exacts: trouble talking about anything but work; difficulty falling asleep after hours glued to my laptop; my heart racing with every new ping from Slack.<br />And I’ve learned to notice the financial cost, too. While I’m not yet in full-blown, “I need a break” territory, I can already see the burnout buys staring back at me from my recent receipts: multiple mornings of deluxe breakfast sandwiches with all the pricey add-ons; the once-special but now-routine $25 bottle of chichi wine; and once, I’m red-faced to admit, a pair of glittery earrings designed to look like miniature charcuterie boards."
