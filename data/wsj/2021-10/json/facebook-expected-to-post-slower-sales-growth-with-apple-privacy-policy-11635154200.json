    "body": "Facebook Inc.  is poised to post another quarter of record sales, though analysts expect changes in Apple Inc.’s app-privacy rules to have weighed on the social-media company’s digital-advertising business.<br />Facebook’s earnings, due Monday after market close, could show slower growth in ad sales, the company’s primary source of revenue. It is the first full quarter since Apple, in April, required apps to ask users whether they want to be tracked. That change has made it harder for advertisers to target their ads at the right audience and get information regarding how well their ads performed."
