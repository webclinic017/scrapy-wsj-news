    "body": "In the reconciliation bill, lawmakers propose to spend trillions of dollars on child care, healthcare, education and other necessary initiatives. Unfortunately, many government programs suffer from a common defect: complexity. If the new bill adds complexity, millions of Americans won’t get essential assistance and the country won’t get its money’s worth.<br />Liberals and conservatives alike should care about solving the complexity problem. It would reduce administrative burdens on individuals and businesses and make government programs more cost-effective, while making it faster and easier for eligible Americans to get the assistance they need."
