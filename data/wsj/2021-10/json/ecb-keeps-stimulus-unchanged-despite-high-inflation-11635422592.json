    "body": "FRANKFURT—The European Central Bank said it would keep its large monetary stimulus unchanged, delaying a decision on whether to phase out easy money in response to surging inflation as global supply-chain bottlenecks and shortages weigh on the region’s recovery.<br />While the eurozone economy has grown briskly in recent months as governments dialed back social restrictions, the region’s economic output is only expected to return to its pre-pandemic level in early 2022, up to a year later than the larger U.S. economy."
