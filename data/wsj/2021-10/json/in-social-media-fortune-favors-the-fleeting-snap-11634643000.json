    "body": "Social media’s improbable new safe space can be a more profitable one.<br />The Wall Street Journal’s recent investigative series on  Facebook  found  that its algorithm can promote objectionable content and that the company knew Instagram can be harmful for teens. Lawmakers have since convened to better understand how social media can negatively affect children online.
