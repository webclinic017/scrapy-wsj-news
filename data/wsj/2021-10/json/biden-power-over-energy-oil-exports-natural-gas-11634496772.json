    "body": "The White House’s developing response to a global energy crisis raises an unsettling question: If the Biden administration openly discusses restricting energy exports to combat rising consumer fuel prices, what power might it assert to save a planet it believes to be in crisis?<br />Because Congress and the courts have ceded power to the executive branch over the past several decades, the president, if he so chose, could co-opt powerful national security tools to reduce U.S. carbon emissions. As midterm elections approach, progressives will pressure President Biden to do exactly that."
