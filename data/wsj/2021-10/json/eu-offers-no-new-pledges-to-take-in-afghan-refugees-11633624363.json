    "body": "European Union countries have made no new pledges to take in Afghan refugees, almost two months after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, despite promises to provide a way for at-risk groups, especially women, to leave the country.<br />At a resettlement forum in Brussels on Thursday, the United Nations called on EU member states to resettle 42,500 Afghans over the next five years, a figure that EU officials called doable but wouldnâ€™t commit to."
