    "body": "If there’s any doubt about Anthony Bourdain’s outsize influence on 21st-century culture, consider his inclusion in the “Last Interview” series, a collection of small-format volumes that reprint the final public conversations, and then some, of pre-eminent artists and intellectuals such as Hannah Arendt, James Baldwin and Kurt Vonnegut.<br />Bourdain was a self-described “journeyman chef of no particular distinction” whose midcareer swerve into bestselling author, travel influencer, celebrity journalist, social activist and noodle enthusiast came as a surprise—most of all to himself. “I used to think that basically, the whole world, that all humanity were basically bastards,” he admitted to one interviewer in “Anthony Bourdain: The Last Interview.”"
