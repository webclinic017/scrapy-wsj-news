    "body": "Google’s artificial intelligence and machine-learning algorithms have in the past been criticized for how they deal with darker skin tones, including mistakenly tagging photos of Black people as gorillas. The company apologized and said it would fix its software. Now, it’s using AI to power what it calls “the world’s most inclusive camera.”<br />The goal of the Real Tone image processing in Google’s new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro smartphones is to “more accurately highlight the nuances of diverse skin tones,” especially darker complexions, according to the company’s website. The new phones, which begin shipping Thursday, are the first to come with Real Tone."
