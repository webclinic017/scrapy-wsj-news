    "body": "Kudos to Gary Saul Morson for “Partisan Science in America” (op-ed, Oct. 12) and to David Klein for his accompanying illustration of scientists chained to a politician in groupthink. As a trained virologist and practicing neuroscientist, I am appalled at the scientific and political censorship regarding Covid-19 immunization.<br />Every medical student learns that viral immunity can be achieved by natural infection or by vaccination, but natural immunity is better. Natural immunity is recognized in Europe. An Israeli study earlier this year showed the stronger and longer-lasting benefit of natural immunity. But this may be a win-win situation: Either we’ll get cessation of vaccine mandates, as in Texas, or politicians will insist on them at the expense of jobs, education, healthcare and more—and then be voted out."
