    "body": "By John Irving (1989)<br />1. I can still hear Owen Meany’s voice in my head. The sensation is wistful. “A Prayer for Owen Meany” is a book about a time past in my native New England. It is a coming-of-age story about youth: lived, lived out and cut short. Owen’s voice is a bit shrill, a bit loud, coming from a body a bit too small. John Wheelwright is Owen’s best friend and they grow up in the kind of communal, picturesque and hallowed New England village that Stephen King regularly destroys. But there are undercurrents here, too: John and Owen’s friendship is as strained as it is meaningful. Owen hit the baseball that killed John’s mother. Owen is also convinced he is “God’s instrument” and—as it happens—he might be. How can a friendship endure and even grow in the presence of such forces? The answer is that it simply does. Like John, I love Owen and I still miss him. I also miss his stuffed armadillo, which remains one of the best props in the history of literature, right up there with Yorick’s skull."
