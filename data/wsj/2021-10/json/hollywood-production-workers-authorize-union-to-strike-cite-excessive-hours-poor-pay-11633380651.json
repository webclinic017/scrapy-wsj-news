    "body": "LOS ANGELES—The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, a union representing more than 150,000 behind-the-scenes workers in entertainment, took a step toward calling a strike that could shut down production across Hollywood.<br />In a vote on Monday, members gave their leadership the ultimate authority to call a strike should ongoing negotiations over working conditions and pay with studios and the streaming services break down. The vote was taken across 36 local unions representing some 60,000 workers. With nearly 90% of that group casting ballots, 98% voted in favor of strike authorization."
