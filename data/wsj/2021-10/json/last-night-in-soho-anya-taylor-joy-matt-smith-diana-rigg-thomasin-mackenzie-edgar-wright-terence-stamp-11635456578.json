    "body": "When you’re watching a good film, it’s as if the filmmaker has taken you by the hand and said, “Come with me, I want to show you something special.” I was glad to go along with Edgar Wright as “Last Night in Soho” got under way, and why not? He’s the man who gave zombies and robots new leases on life in his classic comedy-horror trilogy comprised of “Shaun Of the Dead,” “Hot Fuzz” and “The World’s End.”<br />His new film held me firmly in its grip with a promising premise. A sweet and timid country mouse, Eloise (Thomasin McKenzie), goes to London to study fashion design and is promptly transported, never mind how, to the time and place she has dreamed of, swinging Soho in the mid-1960s. (A new James Bond is playing at the cinema: It’s called “Thunderball.”) Soon Eloise crosses paths with a local beauty who seems to be her alter ego. Sandie, as she calls herself, could hardly be more alter, since she’s played with a dazzling sense of purpose by Anya Taylor-Joy"
