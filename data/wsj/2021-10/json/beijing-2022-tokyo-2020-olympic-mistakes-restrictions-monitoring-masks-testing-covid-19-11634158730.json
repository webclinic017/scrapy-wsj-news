    "body": "Team USA scored an impressive haul at Tokyo’s Olympics, led by swimmer Caeleb Dressel’s five gold medals. The big winner at the belated Tokyo 2020 games, however, was the Chinese Communist Party. Its Beijing 2022 Olympic leadership no doubt observed with great satisfaction the draconian control that Tokyo imposed on foreign Olympic visitors.<br />Tokyo’s restrictions gave Beijing the excuse for the decision, announced by the International Olympic Committee on Sept. 29, to cloister all accredited Olympic participants at next February’s Winter Games, from arrival to departure, in what the organizers term a “closed loop.” Mainland Chinese spectators will be able to attend, but not foreigners."
