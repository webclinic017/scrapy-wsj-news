    "body": "On Sept. 12, Larry David, the fusspot star of HBO’s long-running awk-com “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” sat in the front row of the Staud fashion show in New York City. He did not appear to enjoy himself. As models swooshed past in buoyant primary-colored clothes, the 74-year-old comedian leaned forward, plugged his ears and stared straight at the floor. In an October appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Mr. David explained that the music at the Staud show was just too loud for him. (Through an HBO representative, Mr. David declined to comment for this article.)<br />“Me, a fashion show…it’s a little out of place,” he told Mr. Kimmel, after explaining that he was in attendance because his friend, the Hollywood super agent Ari Emanuel, is engaged to Sarah Staudinger, the designer of Staud."
