    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Treasury Department is set to soon claw back federal rental assistance from groups that haven’t acted to spend enough of the money so it can be given to other communities with greater need, according to new guidance published Monday.<br />The rental-assistance program is overseen by the Treasury Department but relies on a patchwork of more than 450 state, county and municipal governments and charitable organizations to distribute aid. Many of those groups have struggled to launch their local programs, hire staff and craft rules for how the money should be distributed, as they faced a crush of applications."
