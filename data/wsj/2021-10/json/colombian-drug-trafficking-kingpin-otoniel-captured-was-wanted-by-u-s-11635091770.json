    "body": "BOGOTA, Colombia—Colombia said it has arrested its most-wanted drug-trafficking kingpin, the leader of a rural militia of more than 1,000 fighters who American prosecutors say oversaw a lucrative cocaine-smuggling network to the U.S.<br />After years of using military might against the Gulf Clan in operations that have included aerial bombardments, Colombia announced Saturday the arrest of the group’s commander, Dairo Antonio Úsuga, alias Otoniel. President Iván Duque likened the fall of Mr. Úsuga to the 1993 operation in which Colombian police killed Pablo Escobar, the Medellín cartel boss."
