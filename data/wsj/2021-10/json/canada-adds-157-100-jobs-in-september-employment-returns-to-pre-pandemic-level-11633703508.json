    "body": "OTTAWA--The Canadian economy surprised with a much larger than expected jobs gain in September that returned the employment level back to its pre-pandemic level and brought the unemployment rate below 7% for the first time since the widespread shutdowns in the spring of 2020.<br />The strong data reinforced expectations among some economists that the Bank of Canada could move into the so-called reinvestment phase of its quantitative easing program later this month. During that phase, the bank would purchase only enough bonds to replace those that are maturing, marking a significant milestone in the wind-down of the extraordinary stimulus extended during the pandemic."
