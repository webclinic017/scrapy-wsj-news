    "body": "Clifford Asness hits the nail on the head (“Biden’s Real Tax Target Isn’t the Superrich,” op-ed, Oct. 20). President Biden conveniently confuses the superrich with high wage-earners, and falsely portrays the latter as tax evaders who “don’t pay their fair share.”<br />As a self-employed professional in a law partnership, I am one of those high-wage earners. I pay over 45% of my income in taxes to New York and the U.S. Treasury. That’s not counting real-estate tax, both sides of Social Security and Medicare taxes, sales tax and lost deductions."
