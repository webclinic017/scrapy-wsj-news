    "body": "Bad Bets is a new podcast series from The Wall Street Journal that unravels big-business dramas that have had a major impact on our world. This season, we’re delving into Enron, the ’90s energy giant that later became synonymous with epic corporate fraud. Journal reporters John Emshwiller and Rebecca Smith talk to key players who had a front-row seat to the big egos and unchecked power within Enron, including a whistleblower who speaks on the record for the first time. Now, 20 years after Enron’s collapse, this story is as relevant as ever.<br />In the first episode, Enron CEO Jeff Skilling’s resignation opens the first cracks in the Enron facade. Listen now."
