    "body": "OPEN FIRE defines chef Tomos Parry’s cooking at Brat in East London. “There’s something about its immediacy and simplicity,” Mr. Parry said. “You have to constantly adapt.” He also likes the flavor smoke imparts and the textural variations flames produce.<br />Even cooked in a conventional oven, his first Slow Food Fast recipe—this seared duck breast served with roasted figs, radicchio and grapes—delivers some of the deeply caramelized, meaty flavors and striking contrasts the chef has become known for. By all means, if you have a wood-burning grill, go ahead and make this dish over a fire as it’s currently done at Brat. Either way, the result will be a highly satisfying seasonal meal."
