    "body": "The mass ideologies of the 20th century, Nazism and communism, represented a profound abasement of reason. Yet those ideologies reveal more than we’d like to admit about our own political extremes.<br />Nazism and communism had multiple origins. The U.S. diplomat Robert Strausz-Hupé (1903-2002), a foreign-policy realist, believed it was symbolically no accident that Karl Marx and Frederick Engels published their “Communist Manifesto” in 1848, the year of Europe’s failed democratic revolutions and the last time that liberalism and nationalism “fought on the same side of the barricades.” Had that rupture not occurred—had the 1848 uprisings succeeded across the Continent—there might have been no World War I and consequently no Vladimir Lenin and no Adolf Hitler."
