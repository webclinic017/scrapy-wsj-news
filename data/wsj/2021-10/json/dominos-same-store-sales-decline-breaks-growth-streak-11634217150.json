    "body": "Sales at  Domino’s Pizza Inc.’s  U.S. stores stalled over the summer, ending the pizza chain’s streak of same-store growth during the pandemic.<br />At U.S. locations open for at least a year, sales dropped 1.9% in the three months through early September. That break in Domino’s sales trend helped bring the company’s third-quarter revenue below analysts’ expectations."
