    "body": "President Biden has too much on his plate. But there is one important task he should handle quickly: reappointing Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve.<br />Let me start by praising the other person most frequently mentioned for the post: Fed Gov. Lael Brainard. (Both Mr. Powell and Ms. Brainard are personal friends of mine.) Ms. Brainard is smart and energetic. She has years of relevant experience at the Treasury Department and the Fed, where she has displayed superb judgment on monetary policy and regulatory matters. Were Mr. Powell not in place, I would be screaming from the rooftops that she should get the top job. I hope she does in four years."
