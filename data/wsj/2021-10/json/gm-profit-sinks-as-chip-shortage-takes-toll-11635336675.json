    "body": "General Motors Co. â€™s net profit dropped 40% in the third quarter compared with a year earlier as the computer-chip shortage dented factory output, illustrating that a parts crisis that emerged nearly a year ago continues to drag down car-industry earnings.<br />The Detroit auto maker, reporting record pricing and a lucrative mix of higher-profit SUVs and trucks, has been able to offset some of the challenges and said Wednesday its full-year profit would finish at the high end of its previous guidance."
