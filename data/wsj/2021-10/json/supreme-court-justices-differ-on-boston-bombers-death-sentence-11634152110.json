    "body": "WASHINGTON—Supreme Court justices sharply diverged Wednesday over the fairness of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s death sentence, with liberals questioning the district judge’s exclusion of mitigating evidence and conservatives finding little reason to second-guess decisions made at his 2015 trial.<br />Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan, Chechen immigrants from Kyrgyzstan who followed al Qaeda propaganda online, planted bombs in the 2013 terrorist attack that killed three people and maimed and wounded hundreds of others near the legendary race’s finish line. They fled the scene, committing a spree of additional crimes including the murder of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus police officer. Within days, authorities identified the suspects, prompting a manhunt across Boston and vicinity. Tamerlan was killed in a confrontation with police, while Dzhokhar, a student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, was captured the next day."
