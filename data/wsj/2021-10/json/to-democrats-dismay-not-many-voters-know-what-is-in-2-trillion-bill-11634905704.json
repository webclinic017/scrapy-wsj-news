    "body": "WASHINGTON—As Democrats try to bridge intraparty differences on their roughly $2 trillion social policy and climate framework, they say they also need to confront another challenge: getting people to understand what is in the sprawling package.<br />Recent polls have found that few voters grasp the details of what lawmakers want to include in the bill, which is set to include spending on education, child care and healthcare, among other provisions. With the package in flux, voters don’t know exactly how much it will cost, what programs will be included, how they will be paid for—and whom it will benefit."
