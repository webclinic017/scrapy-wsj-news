    "body": "In 1988, I and thousands of other soldiers who had participated in United Nations peacekeeping operations were collectively awarded the Nobel Peace Prize (“Rest in Peace for a Nobel Prize” by Adam O’Neal, op-ed, Oct. 5). Canada struck a commemorative medal for its eligible awardees, and we were quietly proud.<br />Later in life, as a high-school teacher, I often mentioned that I was a Nobel laureate in my introductory remarks to new students. It led to some productive conversations about duty, honor and a citizen’s obligation to participate in worthwhile activities in the interest of world peace."
