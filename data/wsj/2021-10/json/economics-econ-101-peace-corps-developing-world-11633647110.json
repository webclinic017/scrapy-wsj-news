    "body": "In “The Woke Left’s Primitive Economics” (op-ed, Oct. 6), Paul Rubin writes about the zero-sum thinking of the left and primitive societies. I noticed this attitude while serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in South America: If the pie is not equally divided, those with a bigger slice got theirs from someone else’s share.<br />The upside to this attitude is the willingness to share with those less fortunate—or with everyone. I am still moved by memories of neighbors sharing a meal with me when I knew they had little or no food in the house for the next day."
