    "body": "The State Department issued its first passport with an X gender designation, a significant step for Americans who don’t identify as exclusively male or female.<br />The department said Wednesday it was part of a new federal effort to broaden options available on passports for applicants who are nonbinary, intersex or gender-nonconforming.  A State Department spokesperson said the option of an “X” gender marker is estimated to be available for all passport applicants and those who wish to update their passports by early 2022 after the Office of Management and Budget approves the form updates."
