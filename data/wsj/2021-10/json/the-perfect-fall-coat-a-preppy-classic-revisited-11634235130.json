    "body": "DUFFLE COATS—those wool toppers equipped with hoods and toggle closures—often evoke Paddington Bear or preppy types at uppity academic institutions. On Netflix’s “The Chair,” Sandra Oh wears a gray one in on-the-nose fashion as Ji-Yoon Kim, the beleaguered head of the English department at a fictional prestigious university. But with the duffle as with any classic, unexpected styling can tweak its attitude. Activist June Jordan, seen here in a dark version in the 1960s, wore hers in a subtly subversive way.<br />Her outfit is simple but not ordinary. “From the fit along the shoulders to the hem and cuffs, [the coat] looks effortless and tailored to her,” said New York stylist Mohammad Diallo. Ms. Jordan paired the piece with jeans and hoop earrings—a refreshing contrast to the coat’s usual companions: khakis and loafers. In another photo, she donned her duffle with aviator glasses, their sly coolness undercutting the style’s hearty collegiate character. And her Afro—a counterculture hairstyle that rejected European beauty standards pushed on Black women—also deviated from the preppy conformity associated with duffles. “She has a…cool energy while wearing it,” Mr. Diallo added."
