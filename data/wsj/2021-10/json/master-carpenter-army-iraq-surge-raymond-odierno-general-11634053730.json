    "body": "Gen. Raymond Odierno is often described, aptly, as a gentle giant, and a soldier’s soldier. But to me Odierno, who died of cancer last week at 67, was also just plain smart.<br />During his early years of senior leadership, things didn’t always go so well. Commanding the Fourth Infantry Division when the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, he was known for brass-knuckles tactics in the early months of the occupation in and around Saddam Hussein’s hometown of Tikrit. Saddam was captured on Odierno’s watch in December 2003, but the insurgency also snowballed."
