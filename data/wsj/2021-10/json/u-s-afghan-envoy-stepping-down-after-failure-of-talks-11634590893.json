    "body": "Zalmay Khalilzad, the Biden administration’s special representative for Afghanistan, who for nearly two years tried but failed to negotiate a peace deal with Taliban officials before the group seized control of the country in August, is stepping down from the role, U.S. officials said Monday.<br />Mr. Khalilzad has held a range of roles under several administrations, including U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan and Iraq. In February 2020, Mr. Khalilzad and former President Donald Trump’s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, brokered a deal for a cease-fire and U.S. withdrawal with Taliban political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar with the goal of bringing peace to the beleaguered country."
