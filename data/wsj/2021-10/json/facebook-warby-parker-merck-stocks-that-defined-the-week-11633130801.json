    "body": "Facebook Inc.<br />A version of Instagram designed for children isn’t getting a lot of likes in Washington, D.C. The social media giant said Monday it would suspend its plans for Instagram Kids after lawmakers voiced concerns about the platform’s effects on the mental health of young people. During a Thursday hearing, Senate members then accused the company of disregarding internal research showing that Instagram is harmful for significant numbers of teen girls. Facebook shares fell 3.7% Tuesday."
