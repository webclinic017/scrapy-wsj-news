    "body": "The street that dresses Manhattanâ€™s wealthiest residents is still wearing the scars of the pandemic. But recently, there are signs of healing on Madison Avenue.<br />The famed shopping district, which relies more on locals than tourists, is coming back to life as New Yorkers return to the city, head back to the office and attend society events such as the Met Gala. Falling rent prices and rising availability have also created opportunities for younger retailers and even pop-up shops to open in storefronts normally reserved for established luxury brands."
