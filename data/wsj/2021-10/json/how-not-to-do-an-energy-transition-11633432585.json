    "body": "For a case study in how not to regulate a power market as it moves to incorporate lower-carbon energy, look at the U.K.<br />European natural-gas and power prices surged to new highs Tuesday, raising fresh pressure on the region’s energy suppliers. Last week another three U.K. power companies went bust, bringing the total to nine in September. British suppliers have been squeezed between a government-mandated cap on retail power prices and skyrocketing wholesale prices for natural gas, which is used to produce about a third of the country’s electricity. More bankruptcies are expected, particularly if the coming winter is cold."
