    "body": "If you want to revolutionize the U.S. banking system, should you be in charge of regulating it? Apparently Democrats think so, as they rally to defend President Biden’s nominee for Comptroller of the Currency, Saule Omarova.<br />Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown accuses Pennsylvania’s Pat Toomey of “red scare McCarthyism” for drawing attention to Ms. Omarova’s academic papers and statements. Ms. Omarova advocates central political control of capital, credit and wages, and she has praised the Soviet-era economic system. Are her own words off-limits to scrutiny?"
