    "body": "In the 1980s, Robert B. Haas got rich way faster than he expected. With his private equity partner, Thomas Hicks, he combined soft drink brands Dr Pepper and 7UP into one company, then sold it in 1988, taking huge profits before the market for leveraged buyouts overheated.<br />“Timing is very important,” Mr. Haas told the Dallas Morning News later. “Blind luck is also good.”"
