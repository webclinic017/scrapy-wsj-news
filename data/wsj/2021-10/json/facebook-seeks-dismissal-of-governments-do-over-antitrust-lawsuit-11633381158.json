    "body": "WASHINGTON— Facebook Inc.  filed a new motion Monday seeking the dismissal of a government antitrust case alleging the company engaged in unlawful monopolization, four months after it succeeded in getting an earlier version of the complaint thrown out.<br />The company’s submission, in a Washington, D.C., federal court, is its latest salvo against the Federal Trade Commission, which first sued Facebook in December on allegations that the social-media company was illegally maintaining its dominant position, including by buying up potential rivals such as the messaging platform WhatsApp and image-sharing app Instagram. The commission is seeking to unwind those deals."
