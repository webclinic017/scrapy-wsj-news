    "body": "LONDON—Dutch national flag carrier  KLM  halted all flights to Kyiv and said it won’t operate in Ukrainian airspace—the first major carrier to announce a halt in service as tensions between Russia and the West mount over Ukraine.<br />The airline on Saturday cited a travel warning from the national government over risks to flying in the region. The airline’s next flight to the Ukrainian capital, scheduled for Saturday evening, won’t go ahead, the airline said, adding that it isn’t clear when KLM will resume flights. The move follows new guidance from the Dutch government warning citizens not to travel to the country."
