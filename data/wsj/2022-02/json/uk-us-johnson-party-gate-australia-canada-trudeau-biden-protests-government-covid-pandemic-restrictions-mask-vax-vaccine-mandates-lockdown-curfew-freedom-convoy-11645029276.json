    "body": "Have the heirs of liberty forgotten their heritage? So it has seemed in the Anglosphere the past two years, especially in Commonwealth countries. From Canada and Australia to the U.K. and beyond, the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic has mostly devolved to heavy-handed mandates, unprecedented nanny statism, and incipient authoritarianism. Such policies are incompatible with the principles that built these societies and inappropriate for the descendants of those who gave the gift of ordered liberty to the world.<br />In Canada, a coalition of truckers is rallying against harsh vaccination mandates. The Freedom Convoy is filled with people who may be banned from their jobs because they haven’t complied with a sweeping and sudden government demand. The protest follows nearly two straight years of severe restrictions on daily life, from 10 p.m. curfews with $6,000 fines and total closings of theaters and gyms to restrictions on domestic as well as international travel. Canadian psychologist and author Jordan Peterson recently called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to “open the damn country back up” while lamenting that his homeland is “becoming increasingly authoritarian.”"
