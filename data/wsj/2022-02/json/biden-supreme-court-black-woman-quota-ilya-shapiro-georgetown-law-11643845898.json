    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Race, Gender and the Supreme Court” (Jan. 29): Georgetown University’s speech and expression policy states that the university will provide students and faculty “the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge, and learn” and that speech “may not be suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even by most members of the University community to be offensive, unwise, immoral, or ill conceived.”<br />Last week, incoming faculty member Ilya Shapiro posted tweets critical of President Biden’s explicit use of race and sex in selecting his nominee for the Supreme Court. In response, the dean of Georgetown Law issued a campuswide message calling the tweets “appalling” and “at odds with everything we stand for at Georgetown Law.” The dean then suspended Mr. Shapiro, pending an investigation. Can one infer from this that Georgetown Law does not stand for the university’s speech and expression policy?"
