    "body": "Thank you for standing up for Israel in your editorial “The ‘Apartheid’ Libel of Israel” (Feb. 1). Israel was established as the nation-state of the Jewish people in 1948 with broad international support based in part on the lessons learned from the Holocaust. While founded as the Jewish national home, Israel was established first and foremost as a democracy. In fact, the composition of today’s Israeli government is a strong testament to its democracy. Its ministers include Jews and Arabs, the secular and religious, immigrants, persons with disabilities and members of the LGBTQ community. That is not “apartheid.” Today’s government, and the Knesset, reflect all the diversity and inclusiveness that epitomizes Israel.<br />Abe Foxman"
