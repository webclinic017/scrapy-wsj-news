    "body": "The Winter Olympics get underway in Beijing Friday, and somehow the thrill of victory is gone. The pandemic and China’s “zero-Covid” policy is part of the problem, as even local spectators are banned. But the bigger issue is the way the host country has changed since Beijing hosted the Summer Games in 2008.<br />Those Olympics were a coming out party for a newly rich China. Most world leaders showed up, including U.S. President George W. Bush. The world still hoped that China was evolving into a more politically open government that would play by international rules. Current President Xi Jinping had yet to take control."
