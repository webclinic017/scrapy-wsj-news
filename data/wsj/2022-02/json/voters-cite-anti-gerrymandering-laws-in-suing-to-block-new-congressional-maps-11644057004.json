    "body": "Newly drawn congressional maps in states across the country are facing a wave of novel legal challenges in state courts that could shape the balance of power in the U.S. House next year.<br />The most recent court action came Friday, as the Supreme Court of North Carolina struck down a map drawn by the Republican-led Legislature that had positioned the GOP to win 10 or 11 of the stateâ€™s 14 House seats. It was the second map struck down this year by state courts based on provisions in state constitutions. Last month, the Ohio Supreme Court said the new House map there favored Republicans and should be redrawn."
