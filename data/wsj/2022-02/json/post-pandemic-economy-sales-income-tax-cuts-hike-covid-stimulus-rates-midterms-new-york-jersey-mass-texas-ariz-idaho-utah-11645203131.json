    "body": "The 2008 recession hit state treasuries hard. Most states experienced steep declines in revenue. They responded by raising taxes collectively by $29 billion in fiscal 2009—at the time, the largest annual hike in history. The taxing frenzy, however, quickly dissipated after the 2010 elections, when Republicans won a net seven governorships, upping their count to 29. That set off an intense, often acerbic state competition to attract residents and employers, as Republican states cut taxes and reduced regulation.<br />Now, with a pro-tax Democrat in the White House and a lockdown-induced recession in the rearview mirror, a new clash among the states is breaking out. While several Democratic strongholds have imposed big tax increases, claiming fiscal stress and the need for “equity” in taxation, a group of Republican-led states has cut levies. The contrasts are likely to intensify as November’s elections get nearer, with 36 governorships and more than 6,000 state legislative seats in play."
