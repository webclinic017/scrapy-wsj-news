    "body": "This should be a banner week for Chinese President Xi Jinping. His country is celebrating the lunar new year, the most important holiday in the Chinese calendar, and the Beijing Winter Olympics open Friday. If Mr. Xi isn’t enjoying the festivities, that may be due to fresh signs the economy is in trouble—which is largely his fault.<br />Over the weekend both official and private data suggested manufacturing and services activity are slowing. The Caixin survey of manufacturing managers pointed to an outright contraction. The slump in home sales shows no signs of reversing as turmoil in real estate continues. The International Monetary Fund last week cut its estimate for China’s 2022 economic growth to 4.8% from 5.7%."
