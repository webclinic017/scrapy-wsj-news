    "body": "President Biden plans to deliver his State of the Union address to Congress on March 1, as the Democrat tries to rally support for his agenda with lawmakers and voters headed into the midterm elections.<br />The high-profile speech is often a touchstone moment for presidents, and just a few weeks ago, White House aides had envisioned the evening as a chance for Mr. Biden to focus on plans to fight inflation, promote accomplishments and restore some sense of normalcy after two years of Covid-19. But with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last week, the speech will now take place against the backdrop of the largest ground war in Europe since World War II. Foreign policy will be front and center."
