    "body": "If car makers that generate cash rather than comparisons with  Tesla  are coming back into fashion, investors might want to pay more attention to  Stellantis .<br />The company formed early last year through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot is making better progress with cost savings than expected. Alongside its release of expectation-beating annual results Wednesday it said that it had already hit about 3.2 billion euros, equivalent to $3.6 billion, of a €5 billion target for deal synergies, putting it well ahead of schedule."
