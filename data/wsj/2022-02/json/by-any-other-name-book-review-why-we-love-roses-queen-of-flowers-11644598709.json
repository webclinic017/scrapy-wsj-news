    "body": "When I type the word “flower” into my iPhone’s emoji engine, the algorithm presents me with a red rose. Since at least the early centuries B.C.,  around the first appearance of a poem once attributed to Sappho, the rose has been known as “The Queen of Flowers.” How, among the garden’s many worthies, did it earn such pride of place?<br />Like the apple, the rose has become a logo—in contemporary culture, for romantic love. The rose that TV’s bachelor or bachelorette hands out, the bud magically preserved in Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast”—these perfect blooms represent a dense bouquet of ideas and ideals. Bette Midler doesn’t sing songs about tulips."
