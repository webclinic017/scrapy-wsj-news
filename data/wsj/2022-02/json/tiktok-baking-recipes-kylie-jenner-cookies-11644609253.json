    "body": "EVEN IF YOU’RE not on TikTok, a search for “baking ideas” on any other platform is bound to return videos from the popular app. TikTok’s algorithm is designed to propel videos to viral status, so it’s no surprise that many of today’s baking trends emerge fully formed from that primordial content soup. But while a looping video might be the perfect way to learn to make something as simple as a Crunchwrap (remember that craze?), is it actually possible to bake from a TikTok?<br />Depending on the day, I am either charmed by TikTok baking videos (They’re short! They’re funny! They’re satisfying!) or turned off (Everyone’s making the same recipes! What’s with all the eye contact?). And though I’d been inspired by TikTok on occasion, until recently I hadn’t actually baked from one of the videos, step by step. Curious, I rounded up a few notable examples and tried to do just that."
