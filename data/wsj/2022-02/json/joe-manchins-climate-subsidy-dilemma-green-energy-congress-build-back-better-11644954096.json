    "body": "President Biden is still hoping to get “big chunks” of his Build Back Better agenda passed, and that could mean $500 billion in climate spending, including subsidies for green electricity. Although Sen. Joe Manchin is opposed to a plan to create and enforce clean-power mandates, he seems open to shoveling out money instead.<br />“The climate thing,” he said in early January, “is one that we probably can come to an agreement much easier than anything else.” Typical: Whenever Congress wants to cut a deal, spending is a least common denominator. But given the way energy markets work, it would be a mistake to think of this as mere corporate welfare."
