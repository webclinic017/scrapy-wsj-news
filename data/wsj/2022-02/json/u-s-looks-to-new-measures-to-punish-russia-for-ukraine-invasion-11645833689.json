    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. on Friday sanctioned President Vladimir Putin of Russia as part of a broad range of new measures that the Biden administration is preparing in hopes of inflicting financial pain on Moscow after Russia invaded Ukraine.<br />Penalties targeted not only Mr. Putin but members of his inner circle. The U.S. will also impose full blocking sanctions on the state-owned Russian Direct Investment Fund, a sovereign-wealth fund, according to White House press secretary Jen Psaki. The administration’s broader aim, should Russia continue its incursion in Ukraine, is to target all of Russia’s banks on a rolling basis, a U.S. official said."
