    "body": "In “Will the GOP 2023 Agenda Arrive in 2022?” (op-ed, Feb. 10), Karl Rove refers to Rep. Kevin McCarthy’s seven task forces to craft a Republican legislative message after President Biden asked what Republicans stand for.<br />This seems a lot of work when he could simply employ the KISS principle (keep it simple, stupid) and list the top-10 longstanding imperatives of the Republican Party. They are: 1. Parents rights where their children’s education is concerned, including school choice. 2. Rigid border security. 3. Dignity of work based on self-reliance. 4. Honor the Constitution and Bill of Rights. 5. Fiscal conservatism with a smaller federal government. 6. Free-market capitalism. 7. Religious freedom. 8. Opposition to all lockdowns and masking. 9. Protect infants in the womb. and 10. Free speech without censorship."
