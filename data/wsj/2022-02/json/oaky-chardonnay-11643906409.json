    "body": "COLLOCATION: A WORD for the habitual pairing of two words. Like “unmitigated” and “gall” or “oaky” and “Chardonnay.”<br />I even saw the latter phrase turn up as a clue in a crossword puzzle last month. Like many half-truths, the conception of Chardonnay as perennially oaky has endured. Yet when I talked with Chardonnay makers, sommeliers and retailers recently, I found that many producers have pulled back from oakiness in their wines. At the same time, I was told, many drinkers who say they dislike oak are actually drinking (and liking) oaked Chardonnay."
