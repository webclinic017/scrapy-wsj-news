    "body": "For a lesson in the perils of exposing Washington frauds, see the case of Rep. Elaine Luria. The Virginia Democrat this week punctured the Beltway’s moral preening over lawmakers’ stock trading and is taking it from all sides.<br />As heresies go, Ms. Luria’s was mild, and she spoke common sense. Asked by Punchbowl News about proposals to ban lawmakers from trading stocks, the Navy veteran replied that “the whole concept is bulls—.” She noted that Congress is already bound by disclosure rules (she could also have mentioned insider-trading laws) and that there is no evidence that members are “inherently bad or corrupt.” She is thus “very strongly opposed to any legislation like that.”"
