    "body": "As inflation rises, another low-risk investment is getting more attention: the tried-and-true Series I savings bond known as inflation or I bonds.<br />These federally guaranteed instruments currently have annualized yields of 7.12%, which you can only collect when you cash out. That represents the second-highest rate on newly issued I bonds since they were introduced in 1998, and it is more than double the 2.232% yield on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds."
