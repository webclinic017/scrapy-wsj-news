    "body": "Nicholas Eberstadt’s take on unemployment (“The Underside of the ‘Great Resignation’” by Mene Ukueberuwa, Weekend Interview, Jan. 22) was an oversimplification of our pandemic-era reality. Sure, there will always be unemployed people loafing around and watching screens all day. But for families such as ours, having only one parent working full time during the pandemic has been a blessing. It has allowed one parent to focus on a job, while the other can deal with the multiple pivots to virtual schooling for our kids.<br />We’ve saved thousands of dollars in daycare costs and have cut our food bill, since we have the time to make more meals from scratch and eat at home. Having one parent available to deal with sickness, school closures and life’s other curveballs has helped keep our household running smoothly. This suggestion that those out of the labor force are unproductive shows an ignorance for how many families navigate the pandemic era."
