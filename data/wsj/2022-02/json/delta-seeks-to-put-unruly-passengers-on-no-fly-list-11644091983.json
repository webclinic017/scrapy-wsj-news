    "body": "NEW YORK— Delta Air Lines  has requested that the Justice Department put any person convicted of a disruption on board a flight on the national “no fly” list.<br />In a letter to the Justice Department Attorney General Merrick Garland dated Thursday, Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian said there should be “zero tolerance” for any behavior that affects flight safety. Mr. Bastian noted that while such incidents of bad behavior represent a fraction of overall flights on Delta, the rate of incidents on the airline has increased nearly 100% since 2019."
