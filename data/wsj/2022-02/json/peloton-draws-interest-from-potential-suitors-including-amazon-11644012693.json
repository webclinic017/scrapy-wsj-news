    "body": "Peloton Interactive Inc.  is drawing interest from potential suitors including  Amazon.com Inc.,  according to people familiar with the matter, as the stationary-bike maker’s stock slumps and an activist urges it to explore a sale.<br />Amazon has been speaking to advisers about a potential deal, some of the people said. There’s no guarantee the e-commerce giant will follow through with an offer or that Peloton, which is working with its own advisers, would be receptive."
