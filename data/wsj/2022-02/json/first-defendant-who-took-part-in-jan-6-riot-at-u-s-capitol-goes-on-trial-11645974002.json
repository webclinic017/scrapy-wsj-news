    "body": "WASHINGTON—The first of the pro-Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and who is fighting his charges will go on trial Monday, after more than 200 people have pleaded guilty to committing various offenses that day.<br />The trial is being viewed as a critical test for the government, which has charged more than 750 people in connection to the riot that injured more than 100 police officers and caused more than $1 million in damage in a failed effort to stop the certification of President Biden’s victory over then-President Donald Trump in November 2020."
