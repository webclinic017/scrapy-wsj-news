    "body": "BERLIN—Olaf Scholz, the new leader of Germany, heads for Washington on Sunday, facing pressure to embrace U.S.-led efforts to counter Moscow despite Berlin’s reliance on Russian energy supplies and misgivings in parts of Europe about America’s push to bring Ukraine into the trans-Atlantic fold.<br />Like past German chancellors, Mr. Scholz had tried to balance his country’s membership of the Western alliance with its close ties to Russia. But as Moscow has become more aggressive, Mr. Scholz’s effort to carve a middle path has put him in an international crossfire."
