    "body": "The U.S. Congress agrees that America needs to compete with China. Two recent bills—the House of Representatives’ America COMPETES Act and the Senate’s U.S. Innovation and Competition Act—both take aim at China’s rising scientific heft by increasing federal funding for research, semiconductor plants and a smorgasbord of other programs by more than $200 billion.<br />The two chambers seem unified on little else, however. The House, which passed its bill on Feb. 4, wants to spend more on climate-related programs and on bringing critical supply chains home. The Senate wants to spend more on artificial intelligence and quantum computing. The House bill is also more restrictive on trade."
