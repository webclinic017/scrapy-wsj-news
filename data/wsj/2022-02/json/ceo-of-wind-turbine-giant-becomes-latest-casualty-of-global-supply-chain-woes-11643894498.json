    "body": "Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy SA,  one of the world’s largest makers of wind turbines, replaced its chief executive—a change-up the company said was triggered by profit shortfalls related to pandemic-era supply-chain disruptions.<br />The Spain-based company, which is majority owned by a unit of  Siemens AG , has struggled alongside many companies with supply-chain issues since 2020. Companies have been hit by the pandemic’s start-stop effect on assembly lines. More recently, they have had to contend with booming demand after Covid-19 lockdowns. In response, many have been forced to delay products, raise prices and issue profit warnings. Few so far, though, have replaced their CEO to cope."
