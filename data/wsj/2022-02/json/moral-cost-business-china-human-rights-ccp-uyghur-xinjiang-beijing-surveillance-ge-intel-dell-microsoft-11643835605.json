    "body": "American and other Western companies have long been eager to do business in China, and that made sense when the country was opening to the world and reforming its economy. But operating in China has become more problematic as President Xi Jinping has tightened his political grip on the country and reversed market reforms.<br />The risks are increasingly moral as well as financial. That’s clear from a new report by the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation and the consulting firm Horizon Advisory. The report finds that doing business in China has implicated U.S. and multinational corporations in the Communist Party’s human-rights abuses, the surveillance of Chinese people, and Beijing’s military buildup."
