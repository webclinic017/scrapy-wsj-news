    "body": "Chevron Corp.  is making one of its largest investments in renewable fuels, paying $3.15 billion to buy a company that makes diesel and other fuels from sources such as corn or cooking oil as the fossil-fuel giant faces investor pressure to invest in green energy.<br />The purchase of Iowa-based  Renewable Energy Group Inc.,  which has 11 refineries that source mainly from waste products such as tallow or used cooking oil, will help Chevron in its quest to offer a bigger variety of fuels with lower carbon footprints than oil and natural gas. Chevron plans to continue making acquisitions in the area, and will spend money to convert existing refineries so they can process low-carbon fuel sources, Chief Executive Mike Wirth said."
