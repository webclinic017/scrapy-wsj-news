    "body": "Sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s war machine won’t really bite until they include energy. However dramatic, this is a step investors would be unwise to rule out.<br />Sanctions on Russia announced since it invaded Ukraine last Thursday have been designed to exclude commodity imports. President Biden and his allies fear the impact of comprehensive sanctions on resource markets and their economies, particularly in Europe where gas supplies are already tight. The West buys about $350 million worth of Russian crude daily and Europe spends another $300 million on gas."
