    "body": "At the Giorgio Armani show yesterday, which closed out Milan Fashion Week, the 87-year-old designer sent his collection down the runway to uncomfortable silence. Over the loudspeaker, a voice explained that his decision not to use any music in the show was made as a “sign of respect to people in the unfolding tragedy.” Despite the curious omission of the words “Russia” or “Ukraine,” the message was clear enough. The models, in quietly luxurious Armani classics including trim velvet jackets and a long-sleeved spangled gown, clicked down the glossy runway without the typical pounding soundtrack—just the occasional shuffle of cameras and high heels.<br />The somber move represented a rare synchronization of the gravity of world events with the giddy fashion-week carnival. It also harkened back to February 2020, when Mr. Armani was one of the first designers to acknowledge the burgeoning pandemic by disinviting guests to his show, which unfolded in an empty theater. As one of the undisputed elder statesmen of fashion, he knows that in an industry that’s all about image, symbolism matters. Omitting music from a fashion show could be seen as a hollow gesture or a respectful one, or maybe a little of both."
