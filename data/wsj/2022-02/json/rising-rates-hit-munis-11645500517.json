    "body": "Municipal-bond investors spent more than a decade fretting about state and local government finances. Now they are worried about interest rates.<br />Municipal budgets are in far better shape than during the aftermath of the 2007-09 financial crisis or the early-Covid shutdowns when investors fled munis in droves. But the expectation that the Federal Reserve will begin ending pandemic stimulus measures has driven yields on state and local debt, which rise when bond prices fall, to their highest levels since April 2020."
