    "body": "Berkeley’s Energy Institute at Haas says rooftop solar in California is the most costly way to increase solar power (Letters, Feb. 18). Why invest $45,000 in a rooftop solar system when  PG&E  offers users 100% solar for almost the same price as nonsolar power? There is no market for excess rooftop solar power, since California already gives away enough excess solar power every summer to run 250,000 homes.<br />The economies of scale of a solar farm enables it to produce and store hydrogen to generate electricity for when the sun doesn’t shine. No technological breakthrough is needed and it’s far less expensive than any other green energy. All that’s needed is a political breakthrough."
