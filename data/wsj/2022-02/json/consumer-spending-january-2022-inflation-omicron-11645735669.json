    "body": "U.S. consumer spending rose briskly in January, despite increased prices and Covid-19 infections, but could cool in coming months if Russia’s invasion of Ukraine drives inflation higher, according to economists’ forecasts.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect the Commerce Department to report Friday that spending rose a seasonally adjusted 1.6% in January from the previous month, bouncing back from a 0.6% decline in December. They expect to see personal income fell 0.3% on the month following the expiration of the federal government’s monthly child tax credit."
