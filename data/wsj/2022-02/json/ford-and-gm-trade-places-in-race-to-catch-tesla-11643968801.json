    "body": "In the race to come up with a credible electric-vehicle strategy,  Ford  has caught up with and arguably even overtaken  General Motors  over the past year. But that isn’t likely to be the last twist in a contest that could take a decade or more to produce clear winners.<br />Ford reported underwhelming fourth-quarter results after the bell Thursday, sending the shares 4% lower in after-hours trading. Net income for 2021 was a spectacular $17.9 billion, but roughly half of that was a paper gain on its stake in electric-truck startup Rivian ,  which completed its initial public offering in November. The value of that investment has shrunk by about 40% in this year’s selloff, and underlying profits were lower than analysts had forecast."
