    "body": "Exelon Corp.  on Wednesday spun off its power-generation business into a stand-alone company. The spinoff’s future might hinge on whether the government increases its financial support for nuclear energy in response to climate change.<br />The stand-alone company, called Constellation, operates the nation’s largest fleet of nuclear-power plants and has plans for further growth by acquisition. But the nuclear plants, which have struggled to compete in recent years with cheaper natural-gas plants, as well as solar and wind farms, face uncertainty. Many now rely on state subsidies to survive."
