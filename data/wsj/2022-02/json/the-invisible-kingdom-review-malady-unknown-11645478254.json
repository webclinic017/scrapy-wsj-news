    "body": "She lay in the dark in the small hours of the morning, awake, wrapped in a fog, encumbered by never-ending fatigue as the world slept—a gray traveler in a gray world. In this cocoon, she would stare at her computer screen, browsing for imaginary outfits to be worn on imaginary outings. It was an act of longing, of sorts: an attempt to be the person she wanted to be, someone who could enjoy life free from pain. But the greatest ordeal—greater than the unexplained electric shocks that rattled through her body or the unbearable abdominal pains that kept sending her back to the ER—was her doctors’ denial that she was sick at all.<br />As Meghan O’Rourke recounts in “The Invisible Kingdom: Reimagining Chronic Illness,” there is often loneliness in being sick. But for those with rare and undiagnosed conditions, the very acknowledgment of suffering is denied. The chronically ill self is negated, not by disease but by a medical system that frequently rejects patients’ experiences and dismisses their testimony."
