    "body": "Spotify Technology SA  has been facing public scrutiny over content from Joe Rogan on its platform after musician Neil Young pulled his music from the streaming service in objection to what he said was misinformation by the company’s star podcaster. On Jan. 30, Mr. Rogan responded in a 10-minute Instagram video post and pledged to be more balanced and informed about controversial topics and guests. Spotify earlier that day published its platform policies, which it said were longstanding and developed internally with the help of outside experts.<br />The controversy began when Mr. Young, a 76-year-old folk-rock star whose hits including “Heart of Gold” and “Harvest Moon” have gained hundreds of millions of plays on Spotify, demanded that Spotify remove his music over what he says is vaccine misinformation spread by Mr. Rogan on the streaming service."
