    "body": "Language is a curious mix of order and disorder. Anyone who has struggled to master English has confronted its baffling assembly of regular verb patterns (Kisha wanted), quirky sub-rules (Pablo rang) and wild exceptions (Barlow went). And English is no special case.

Answering this question turns out to be crucial to understanding how language works."
