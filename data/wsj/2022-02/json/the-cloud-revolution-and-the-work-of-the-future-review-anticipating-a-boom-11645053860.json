    "body": "Years before a purported shortage of truck drivers brought us empty supermarket shelves, a purported surplus of truck drivers was making headlines. In 2016, the Council of Economic Advisers warned that nearly all jobs driving heavy trucks were threatened by self-driving vehicles. A year later, Goldman Sachs foresaw 300,000 jobs vanishing annually when autonomous vehicles take over. The Guardian reported that “self-driving trucks are set to lay waste to one of the country’s most beloved jobs—and the fallout could be huge.” Perhaps such carnage will yet devastate the truck-driving profession. To date, though, the number of truckers displaced by autonomous vehicles is zero.<br />Forecasting is a risky business, so when Mark Mills asserts that technology has brought us to “the beginning of the next great cycle” of productive innovation, some skepticism may be in order. But even if you don’t fully buy into Mr. Mills’s claim that new technologies will create the Roaring 2020s, “The Cloud Revolution” provides an entertaining tour of a wide range of developments that have the potential to reshape our world sooner than we might expect."
