    "body": "SOMETIME IN LATE 1966, two college students watched an old World War II film about the French Resistance. Inspired by the characters’ revolutionary zeal and style, one turned to the other and said, “Let’s wear berets, man.”<br />The speaker was Bobby Seale, and he was addressing his friend Huey P. Newton. They had recently founded the Black Panther Party for Self Defense (which later simply became the Black Panther Party) and, cognizant of the need for what Mr. Seale called “good visuals,” had settled on an all-black uniform of a leather jacket, trousers and polished shoes. As Mr. Seale noted in the above anecdote, which appeared in his foreword to Stephen Shames’s 2006 photography book “The Black Panthers,” the black beret would provide the crowning touch. The duo’s grasp of image was impeccable. In countless photographs taken of the Panthers and other political groups of the era—the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Students for a Democratic Society—Black Panther Party members stand out. They looked sleek, militaristic and, to many Americans of the era, menacing."
