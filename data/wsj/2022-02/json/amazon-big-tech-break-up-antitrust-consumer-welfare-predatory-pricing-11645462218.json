    "body": "In “The Case for Splitting Amazon in Two” (op-ed, Feb. 8), Joe Lonsdale writes that “when artificially low prices drive competitors out of a sector, concerns about predatory pricing arise.” He looks to antitrust law for the solution. But who determines whether pricing is “predatory”? I suppose it’s government bureaucrats, egged on by private actors such as Mr. Lonsdale, whose venture-capital firm invests in Amazon’s e-commerce competitors. A better alternative would be to let the consumer decide.<br />Milton Friedman at one time supported antitrust laws, until he realized that “instead of promoting competition, antitrust laws tended to do exactly the opposite, because they tended, like so many government activities, to be taken over by the people they were supposed to regulate and control. . . . Antitrust very quickly becomes regulation.”"
