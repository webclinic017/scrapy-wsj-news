    "body": "President Biden has made his pick for the U.S. Supreme Court: Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. She has a thin appellate record. At least on regulation and business questions, she’s probably to the left of retiring Justice Stephen Breyer. We’ll see what Senate vetting brings, but the GOP shouldn’t indulge in the left’s scorched-earth tactics.<br />Judge Jackson’s elevation wouldn’t change the Supreme Court’s direction in the near term, since she’d replace a fellow liberal. But at age 51 she could serve for three decades. Although Judge Jackson clerked for Justice Breyer, she might lack his pragmatic and independent streak. He is less hostile to business and religious liberty than Justice Sonia Sotomayor."
