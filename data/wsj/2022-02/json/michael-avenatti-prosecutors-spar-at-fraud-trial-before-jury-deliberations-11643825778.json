    "body": "A federal jury began deliberations in the fraud trial of Michael Avenatti Wednesday afternoon after the disgraced celebrity lawyer and prosecutors clashed over whether he fleeced his former client Stormy Daniels out of money from a book deal.<br />Mr. Avenatti, who is serving as his own lawyer, said during closing arguments that he was an advocate and champion for Ms. Daniels in her legal fights with then-President Donald Trump in 2018. He told jurors in Manhattan that his work entitled him to a percentage of her $800,000 book advance, saying her claims that he stole from her werenâ€™t credible."
