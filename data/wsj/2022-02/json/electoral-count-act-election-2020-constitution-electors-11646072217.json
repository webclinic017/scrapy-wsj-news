    "body": "Your editorial “Preventing Another Jan. 6” (Feb. 17) argues that the Electoral Count Act (ECA) is unconstitutional and “the only real way to prevent future mischief is to repeal” it.<br />The Constitution directs that Electoral College members mail their presidential votes to Congress, where the president of the Senate shall “open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted.” The Framers didn’t specify how the count would proceed. The ECA attempts to fill that silence."
