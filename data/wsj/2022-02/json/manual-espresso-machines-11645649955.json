    "body": "LIKE ANY self-respecting coffee snob, I have a battery of beans and grinders and brewing apparatuses at home. But crafting a perfect espresso shot is one trick I’ve always been content to leave to practiced baristas with way-beyond-my-budget, cafe-quality espresso machines.<br />That is, until a pal tipped me off to the Flair Pro 2—the flagship in a suite of manual espresso machines that has been earning accolades from bean nerds since a 2016 launch.

Could I really produce top-level espresso at home for a few hundred bucks, using little more than my own elbow grease?"
