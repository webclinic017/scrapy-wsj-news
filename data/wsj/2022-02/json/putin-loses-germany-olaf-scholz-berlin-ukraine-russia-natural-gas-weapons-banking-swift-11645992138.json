    "body": "Vladimir Putin’s bloody assault on Ukraine is opening many eyes, and perhaps the biggest awakening is in Germany. The invasion has produced what amounts to an epiphany in German defense and foreign policy.<br />On Saturday Germany’s chancellery said it would send 1,000 antitank weapons and 500 Stinger surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine “as quickly as possible.” That’s a reversal of Berlin’s policy since World War II of not supplying lethal weapons."
