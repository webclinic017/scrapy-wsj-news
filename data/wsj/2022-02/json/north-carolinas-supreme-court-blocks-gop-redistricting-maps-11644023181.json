    "body": "North Carolina’s Supreme Court struck down the voting maps enacted by the Republican-controlled state legislature, saying they violated the state’s constitution, in a closely watched case with implications for the balance of political power in the state’s legislature and congressional delegation.<br />In a divided ruling, the court said that the congressional and state legislative districts as drawn by Republicans are unlawful partisan gerrymanders that violate measures of the North Carolina constitution. The court told the state legislature to draw new maps."
