    "body": "Vermont lawmakers approved a state constitutional amendment on Tuesday enshrining abortion rights, the culmination of a yearslong legislative effort that could make the New England state the first in the U.S. with such protections.<br />Voters will have final say on the amendment, known as the Right to Personal Reproductive Autonomy Amendment, or Proposition 5, on the ballot in November. The proposal would establish a person’s “right to personal reproductive autonomy,” which would include protections around abortion, birth control access and sterilization."
