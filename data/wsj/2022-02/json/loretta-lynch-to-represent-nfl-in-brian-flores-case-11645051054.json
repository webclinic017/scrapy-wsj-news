    "body": "Former Attorney General Loretta Lynch is representing the National Football League in the racial-discrimination lawsuit filed by former Miami Dolphins coach Brian Flores, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Ms. Lynch adds a high-profile front to the NFL’s defense against the claims leveled by Mr. Flores, who sued the league and three teams earlier in the month, alleging racial discrimination in the hiring process for Black coaches. An NFL spokesman has called the lawsuit meritless."
