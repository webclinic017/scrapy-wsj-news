    "body": "Hobbled by restrictive Covid policies and some of the nation’s highest taxes on individual income and property, the District of Columbia recently suffered a sudden population decline. But if there are problems with D.C. governance, at least local officials are relatively honest about them, and lately have not been saddling the city’s future taxpayers with the burdens of current spending. Odd as it may sound, the city that is home to our financially reckless federal government recently earned the top spot in a ranking of urban financial health. Meanwhile, New York City finished at the bottom, only slightly below Chicago.<br />The nonprofit group Truth in Accounting recently released its sixth annual Financial State of the Cities report based on 2020 financial reporting from the nation’s most populous 75 cities* and gave Washington its top ranking."
