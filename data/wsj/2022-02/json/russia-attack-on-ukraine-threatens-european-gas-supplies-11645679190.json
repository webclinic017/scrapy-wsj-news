    "body": "Natural-gas prices rose around the world as Russia’s new military push against Ukraine posed a threat to Europe’s already tenuous supply of the vital heating and power-generation fuel.<br />Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier this week said he wouldn’t turn off his country’s flow of gas to Europe, after deploying troops to two breakaway Ukrainian provinces. But his announcement early Thursday of fresh military action in the country ratchets up risks to Ukraine’s gas-transport infrastructure, crucial to European supplies. It also poses the threat that Russia will shut off its gas in response to Western sanctions meant to punish Moscow."
