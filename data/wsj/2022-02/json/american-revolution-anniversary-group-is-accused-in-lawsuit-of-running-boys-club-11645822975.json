    "body": "WASHINGTON—Four female former executives on Friday sued the federal commission and two affiliated nonprofits planning the official commemoration of the American Revolution’s 250th anniversary, alleging mismanagement and discrimination drove them from their jobs at the America250 Foundation.<br />Renee Burchard, the foundation’s chief administration officer and chief of staff, and Kirsti Garlock, its chief legal officer, resigned in December. That followed the September resignations of Anna Laymon, vice president of programs and planning, and Keri Potts, vice president of communications and public relations. The Wall Street Journal reported on the women’s allegations earlier this month."
