    "body": "BOGOTÁ, Colombia—The highest court in Colombia decriminalized abortion up to the 24th week of pregnancy, making the country the third large country in Latin American to lift stringent restrictions on the procedure in a little more than a year.<br />The country’s Constitutional Court ruled 5-4 Monday in a case brought by a coalition of women’s rights groups. The decision comes after Mexico’s Supreme Court ruled last September that making abortion a crime was unconstitutional. Argentina’s Congress legalized abortion up to the 14th week of pregnancy in December 2020."
