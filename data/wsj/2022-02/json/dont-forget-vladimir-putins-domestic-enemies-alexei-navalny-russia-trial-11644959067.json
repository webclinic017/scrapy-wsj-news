    "body": "As the world braces for a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin’s war on domestic critics continues. On Tuesday a new criminal trial began in which Alexei Navalny stands accused on phony charges of embezzling millions of dollars from his anti-corruption organization.<br />The opposition leader could face more than a decade in prison if convicted by the kangaroo court. The proceedings are taking place in a penal colony, where he is already serving a bogus sentence, though his real crime is threatening Mr. Putin’s grip on power."
