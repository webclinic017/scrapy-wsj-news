    "body": "WASHINGTON—In his 26 months as head of Islamic State, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi kept a low profile, never issuing the kind of proclamations or video clips that were a signature of his predecessor Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and other terrorist group leaders.<br />Qurayshi, who died early Thursday during a raid in northwest Syria by U.S. special forces, had grounds for tight operational security. He had spent roughly four years in a U.S. prison in Iraq, and dozens of his colleagues had been killed in U.S. strikes, Western security officials said. He became Islamic State’s leader after Baghdadi detonated a suicide vest rather than be captured by U.S. forces in October 2019."
