    "body": "Auto parts are getting pricier, but they are in a sweet spot for the retailers that sell them. They still aren’t close to generating the kind of sticker shock that fully assembled cars can set off these days.<br />Advance Auto Parts  said in its earnings call on Tuesday that comparable-store sales increased 8.2% in its fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, trouncing the 5.7% figure analysts polled by FactSet had expected. For the full year, the retailer saw comparable sales grow 10.7%, topping its own guidance and quite the step-up compared with the 2.4% growth it saw in 2020. Its larger peer  O’Reilly Automotive  saw comparable sales grow 13.3% in 2021 after seeing 10.9% growth in 2020."
