    "body": "Extraordinary moves in Big Tech stocks in response to small changes in their earnings show what a wacky market we’re in. Uncertainty about the future of the economy in general and the tech sector in particular are extremely high. In short, nobody knows anything.<br />The biggest moves in terms of dollar value were in Meta ( Facebook -as-was on Thursday lost the most market value in a day of any U.S. company ever) and  Amazon  (which had the biggest market-value gain of any U.S. company ever on Friday). The uncertainty is deep, but there are common threads tying their moves into other hefty price swings in this earnings season."
