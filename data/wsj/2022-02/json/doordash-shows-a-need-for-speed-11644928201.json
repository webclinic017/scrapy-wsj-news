    "body": "If fast food isn’t fast, what exactly is it? Perhaps a waste of money for everyone involved.<br />On Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that  DoorDash  negotiated new terms with  McDonald’s  restaurants to give priority to speed at the expense of commission rates. According to documents seen by the Journal, DoorDash has agreed to lower its commission base for McDonald’s U.S. restaurants, but it will charge them higher commissions starting next year for orders that keep a delivery driver waiting."
