    "body": "While the U.S. and the European Union agree that Russia would face consequences for an expanded invasion of Ukraine, they’re still debating how far sanctions should go and what would trigger them. As talks drag out in Washington and Brussels, the United Kingdom can move quickly to crack down on ill-gotten Russian wealth.<br />“I don’t think Putin will be deterred by any piece of legislation in the Senate,” GOP Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday, referring to struggling negotiations over a sanctions bill. The Senate is divided on the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and whether to impose sanctions pre-emptively, and the House is leaving town. A strong bipartisan bill would send a message to Moscow, but Mr. McConnell is right that President Biden already has significant authority to punish Russian aggression."
