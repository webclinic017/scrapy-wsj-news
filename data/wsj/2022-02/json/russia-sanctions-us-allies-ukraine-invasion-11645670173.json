    "body": "The U.S. and its allies are poised to unveil further, sweeping sanctions against Russia after Moscow launched what President Biden called “an unprovoked and unjustified attack” on Ukraine, hoping a fresh tranche of penalties will punish Russia and persuade it to ratchet down hostilities.<br />European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Thursday morning that the European Union will place “massive and targeted” sanctions on Russia over its aggression in Ukraine, aiming at its financial sector, freezing Russia assets and banning the export of technology to Russia. Late Wednesday in Washington, Mr. Biden condemned the attack and said he would confer with allies about next steps in response to Moscow’s military action. Leaders from the Group of Seven countries will meet Thursday."
