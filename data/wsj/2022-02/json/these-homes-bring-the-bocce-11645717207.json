    "body": "When Mike Freeman, a healthcare consulting firm director based in Zachary, La., installed his bocce court, he had only observed the lawn game. He was intrigued, though, by its history—bocce is an ancient sport that’s popular in Italy—and knew he wanted a court in his backyard.<br />Now he enjoys the festive atmosphere the bocce court creates. “Our parties start in the house and naturally gravitate to the bocce court and fire pit area as the night progresses,” he said."
