    "body": "Amazon.com Inc.  will allow fully vaccinated employees to go maskless inside of its warehouses and is taking steps to adjust its paid time off policies after several states lifted indoor mask mandates this week.<br />The e-commerce giant said in a memo to employees Thursday that the masking policy change would go into effect on Friday. Amazon in December began to require masks for all employees due to the rapid spread of the coronavirus’s Omicron variant. The company earlier had only required staff who weren’t vaccinated to wear masks."
