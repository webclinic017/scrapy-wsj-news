Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is playing salesman for Plan B—an initial public offering of chip designer Arm.<br />Mr. Son sounded as if he were on a roadshow for investors at a news conference in Tokyo on Tuesday. He said Arm is entering a “golden period” of high demand for the chips it helps create in smartphones, electric vehicles and computer-server farms operated by the likes of  Amazon.com Inc."
