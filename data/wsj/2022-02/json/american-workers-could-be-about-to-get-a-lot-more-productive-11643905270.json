    "body": "American workers didn’t get much more productive last year. This year could be different.<br />The Labor Department on Thursday reported that productivity, as measured by how much the average worker produces in a typical hour, grew at a 6.6% annual rate in the fourth quarter from the previous quarter. A big gain, but one that came on top of a substantial 5% decline in the third quarter. For the whole of 2021, productivity rose 1.9%. That was less than 2020’s 2.4% productivity gain, and less than the 2% logged in the pre-pandemic year of 2019."
