    "body": "The new president, at the end of his first full year in the White House, faces an uncertain economy, stubborn inflation, foreign-policy threats, and sliding public approval ratings. The budget deficit is soaring, and the Federal Reserve is stumped. The president’s opponents in Congress claim his policies have failed, and some members of his own party, facing big losses in midterm elections, are resisting his policy proposals.<br />This was Ronald Reagan’s precarious position at the beginning of his second year as president 40 years ago. How he sized up the political scene, and the course he chose for his difficult second year, is a case study in presidential leadership from which Joe Biden could learn."
