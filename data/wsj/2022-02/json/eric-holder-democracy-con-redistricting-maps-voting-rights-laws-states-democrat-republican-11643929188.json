    "body": "To understand the political con that is the Democrats’ “voting rights” push, look at the bait-and-switch that preceded it. Eric Holder this week cemented his party’s ruthless and partisan gerrymandering victory over Republicans—all in the name of “democracy.”<br />The left is at full pitch on its voting “reform” campaign—accusing Republican states of “rigging” elections with laws to suppress the minority vote. They insist Democrats’ proposed federal takeover of state elections is the only thing that will save the country, the Constitution, justice and the cosmos. They claim the stakes are so high that it is necessary to blow up the Senate filibuster and strip all 50 states of their longtime power to set election rules. They also declare anyone who isn’t on board a racist."
