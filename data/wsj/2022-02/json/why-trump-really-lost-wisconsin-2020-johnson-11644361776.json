    "body": "As a loyal Wisconsin Republican, I take issue with William Doyle’s letter “The Role of Zuckerberg’s Money in Wisconsin” (Feb. 3). Mr. Doyle writes that without Center for Tech and Civic Life involvement, “Wisconsin would have been a solidly red state in 2020.”<br />As our Sen. Ron Johnson stated, “There’s nothing obviously skewed about the results.” President Trump got around 1,610,000 votes, while Republicans garnered a record 1,661,000 votes for state assembly candidates, he said, and the same record amount for congressional candidates."
