    "body": "Walter Russell Mead’s reading of Vladimir Putin’s risk-taking is correct (“Why Putin is Outfoxing the West,” Global View, Feb. 22), but his risks in invading Ukraine are lower now than at any time since the breakup of the Soviet Union. The stars have all aligned for the Russian president.<br />We have a weak and risk-averse president in the U.S. (remember his opposition to taking down Osama bin Laden); Germany, Italy and most of Europe are dependent on Russian gas, so sanctions can go only so far; the U.S. has been curtailing fossil-fuel production in favor of renewable energy, making its reliability as an exporter of natural gas suspect; and China is cheering Russia on—not a bad fan base. The fox is in the henhouse, ready for a sumptuous meal."
