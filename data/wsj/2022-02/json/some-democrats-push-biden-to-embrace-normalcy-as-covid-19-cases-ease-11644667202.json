    "body": "WASHINGTON—Some Democrats are pushing President Biden to use his planned State of the Union speech to endorse a return to a sense of normalcy as Covid-19 cases fall, pressuring the White House as many of the party’s governors are rolling back restrictions in their states.<br />The elected officials are zeroing in on the March 1 speech as a pivotal opportunity for Mr. Biden to embrace dropping of mask mandates and other rules, as cases decline from the recent Omicron surge but hospitalizations remain high in parts of the country. They are hoping the prime-time address can lift public morale and boost the party heading into midterm elections, where Democrats are considered to face an uphill fight keeping control of Congress."
