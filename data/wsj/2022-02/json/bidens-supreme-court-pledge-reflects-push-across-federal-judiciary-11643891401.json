    "body": "President Biden’s promise to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court follows a year in which the White House made increasing diversity throughout the federal bench a central priority.<br />Of the 42 life-tenured judges Mr. Biden has placed on the federal courts so far, more than three-quarters have been women, and more than two-thirds have been people of color. Two so far have been white men. The president has roughly 40 additional judicial nominees pending before the Senate."
