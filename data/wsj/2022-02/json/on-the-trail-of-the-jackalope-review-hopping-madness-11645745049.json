    "body": "Hybrids are popular these days: cars that run on electricity and gas, people who run on pig hearts and other animal entrails, journalists who blend fact, fiction and malevolence. The most captivating hybrids, however, are the more exotic blends: the centaur (half-man, half-horse), the mermaid (half-woman, half-fish) and of course the jackalope, a rabbit sporting a set of antlers.<br />Those who know little about the jackalope will be happy that Michael Branch has come hopping along. Mr. Branch, a professor of literature whose books include “How to Cuss in Western,” knows at least as much about jackalopes as Einstein knew about physics. He also speaks with amusing authority on Bat Boy, religious visages seen in diner food, and other odd sightings."
