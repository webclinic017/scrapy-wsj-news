    "body": "BETH DOTOLO, an interior designer in Seattle, Wash., recently fielded a request from a potential client that could flummox even the most capable décor wizards. “They said they had two traditional, overstuffed red recliners that they absolutely had to incorporate into their space,” said Ms. Dotolo, co-founder of Pulp Design Studios. “I was like, ‘Well, first of all, challenge accepted, but I’m sure I can show you what other options are out there…[some] you don’t even know are recliners until they’re actually put into motion.’”<br />That’s right. The uncouth behemoths that Joey Tribbiani Jr. and Chandler Bing defended on “Friends” have gotten a glow-up. Design Within Reach sells the Vala Swivel Recliner—a pebble-shaped perch that would satisfy James Bond, off the clock and ready to tip back a martini. Arhaus offers the Rowland Leather Motion Recliner, a chicly blocky seat whose supple leather is sewn into natty flanged edges."
