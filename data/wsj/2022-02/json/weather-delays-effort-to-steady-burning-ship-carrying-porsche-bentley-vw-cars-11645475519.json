    "body": "Heavy tug boats reached the Felicity Ace, a merchant ship with a hold full of German luxury cars that has been drifting ablaze in the Atlantic for nearly a week, but bad weather delayed the arrival of other ships needed to steady the vessel and stop the blaze.<br />The intensity of the fire has weakened, local authorities and SMIT Salvage said Monday, but the ship is still burning and too hot to board."
