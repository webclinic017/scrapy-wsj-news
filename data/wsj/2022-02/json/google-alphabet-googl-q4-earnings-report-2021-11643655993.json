    "body": "Google parent  Alphabet Inc.  is expected to report another quarter of strong sales growth, capping a year when profits nearly doubled despite mounting regulatory pressure that threatens the search giant’s future.<br />The company’s dominance in online search, video and internet ad sales made it one of last year’s leading beneficiaries of an upswing in digital advertising.
