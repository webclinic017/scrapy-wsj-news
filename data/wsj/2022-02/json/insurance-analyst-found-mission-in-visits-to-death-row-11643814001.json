    "body": "Thomas G. Rosencrants, who grew up in Jackson, Mich., as the son of a postal clerk, felt an early vocation to become a Roman Catholic priest but gave up that plan and studied philosophy instead at the University of Dayton.<br />He veered into finance after finding work as an underwriter at Prudential Insurance Co. in Chicago. He later made a name for himself as a frequently quoted insurance-industry investment analyst at William Blair & Co., Conning & Co., Interstate/Johnson Lane Inc. and Robinson-Humphrey Co. A resident of Atlanta, he also ran a company providing software for insurers and headed a private-equity firm."
