    "body": "American presidents have insisted for two decades that they would never permit Iran to acquire nuclear weapons, but they let Iran make so much progress that its bomb program is now effectively unstoppable. The mistake of U.S. leaders was to forswear military action except as a last resort, which gave Iran a green light for gradual yet irreversible nuclear advances. Acknowledging this error won’t stop Iran but might block future proliferators.<br />Atomic bombs require plutonium or highly enriched uranium. Countries seeking such weapons need the ability to enrich uranium or a nuclear reactor and reprocessing plant to obtain plutonium. That’s why U.S. nonproliferation policy has focused on preventing the spread of enrichment and reprocessing. Weaponization also requires additional technology—a metallic core, an implosion package, and a delivery system—but these can’t be easily controlled because the research is small-scale or can be spun off from legitimate civilian technologies."
