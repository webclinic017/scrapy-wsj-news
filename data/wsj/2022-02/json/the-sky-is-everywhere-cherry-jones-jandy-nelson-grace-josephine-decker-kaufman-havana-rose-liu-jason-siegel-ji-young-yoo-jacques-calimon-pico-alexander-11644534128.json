    "body": "The brights are brighter than they have any right to be in “The Sky Is Everywhere.” Flowers in rainbow profusion recall “The Wizard of Oz.” Hummingbirds have a choice of feeders. When a handsome member of the high-school honor band plays a gleeful riff on a trumpet, notes stream out of his horn and dance in the air as they once did in “Fantasia.” And the darks can be all-encompassing. Seventeen-year-old Lennie (a lovely performance by Grace Kaufman) has just lost her beloved older sister, Bailey (Havana Rose Liu), and she is inconsolable. Josephine Decker’s screen version of the Jandy Nelson young-adult novel, which was adapted by the author, embraces excess as an expression of the heroine’s mercurial spirit. Sometimes the results are excessively excessive, blithely blissed-out or simply clichéd. Mostly, though, they’re funny, affecting and endearing.<br />And daring. In a time of focus-grouped screenplays and coolly calculated productions, here’s an independent film that risks all to portray joy, grief and assorted bewilderments in between. (It’s playing in theaters and streaming on Apple TV+.)"
