    "body": "Rising wages and fuel expenses are exacerbating defense companies’ challenge of controlling costs for weapons and systems to fit the Pentagon’s budget.<br />The U.S. fiscal 2022 defense budget request of $715 billion assumed inflation of 2.2% when it was made last year. Actual prices have run well ahead of that projection, however. Fuel was forecast to rise 10% during the fiscal year, but crude oil prices are up about 55% over the past 12 months."
