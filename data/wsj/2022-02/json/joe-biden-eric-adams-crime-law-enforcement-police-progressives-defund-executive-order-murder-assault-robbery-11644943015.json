    "body": "After the civil disorder of the late 1960s and early 1970s, Democrats were tagged as antipolice and soft on crime, charges it took them decades to overcome. Now the party’s response to George Floyd’s murder has brought those charges back to center stage. Calls to reduce funding for police may have cost Democrats as many as 12 House seats in 2020, and a recent poll showed that only 36% of Americans approve of the way President Biden is handling crime.<br />In early February, Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer, chairman of the House Republican Campaign Committee, issued a stark challenge to Democrats. “If you’re not willing to stand up and speak out against this ‘defund the police’ movement within your own party, you own it,” he said."
