    "body": "Some 31 million Americans are estimated to have bet more than $7 billion on some aspect of Sunday’s Super Bowl LVI, including who won the coin flip and whether Odell Beckham Jr. would score a touchdown. For Joe Biden and the Democrats, Rams-Bengals was a win-win, a sure bet.<br />Odds are that no small amount of the $7 billion wagered came out of the megabillions Mr. Biden’s mailed out as stimulus checks. Winning a wager is more fun than paying the rent, but when you win more than chump change, Mr. Biden gets a piece of the action. Gambling winnings of $600 or more are taxable as federal income, reportable on IRS Form W-2G and subject to withholding at 24%. The state in which you placed the winning bet also wants its piece. In the new world of legal sports betting, no one will get more hops through the end zone than Uncle Sam."
