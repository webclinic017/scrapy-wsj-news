    "body": "President Biden announced new sanctions against Russia on Thursday, but they were hardly the “massive consequences” he promised. The financial markets figured that out quickly as they staged a sharp rebound after Mr. Biden’s remarks. Even more disappointing is the failure to go after the heart of the Kremlin’s power.<br />Mr. Putin runs Russia like a gang in which wealth is shared among cronies but the general population sees few benefits. The system has made the Russian leader and his friends extremely rich. The living standards of average Russians are less important to Mr. Putin than protecting his coterie. These elites maintain their power so long as they support the regime."
