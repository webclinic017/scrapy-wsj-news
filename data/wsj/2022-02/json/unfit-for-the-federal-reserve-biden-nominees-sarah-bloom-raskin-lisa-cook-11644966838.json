    "body": "President Biden is trying to diversify the Federal Reserve, and in more ways than race or gender. The Fed could certainly use more ideological diversity, but two of his nominees to the Board of Governors want to effectively rewrite its mandate to include climate and race. This makes them unfit for the Fed.<br />Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday denied Democrats a quorum to vote five Biden Fed nominees to the floor. Theyâ€™re not seeking to hold up Chairman Jay Powell, Philip Jefferson or Lael Brainard. But they have raised serious concerns about Sarah Bloom Raskin and Lisa Cook that Democrats have brushed aside."
