    "body": "Several large online publishers are taking steps to abandon a program from  Alphabet  Inc.’s  Google that was billed as a way to optimize readers’ mobile-browsing experience, saying it generates less advertising revenue.<br />Companies including Vox Media LLC,  BuzzFeed Inc.’s  Complex Networks and Bustle parent BDG said they have started testing or are considering using their own versions of mobile-optimized article pages, instead of building them using the Accelerated Mobile Pages framework, which Google introduced in 2015 and is supported by an open-source working group. The Washington Post has gone a step further, abandoning AMP last summer."
