    "body": "In 1957, Edgar Smith was a 23-year-old Bergen County, N.J., roughneck and ex-Marine, recently fired from his job at a muffler shop. One weekday afternoon in March he left his teenage bride and newborn daughter to join some friends at a bowling alley. On the evening of the same day, a casual acquaintance of Smith’s, 15-year-old Victoria Zielinski, began walking home from a girlfriend’s house, where she had been studying for an exam. Because Wyckoff Avenue was unlit and forested, Victoria had asked her younger sister, Myrna, to meet her along the route and accompany her home. But Myrna couldn’t find her. By that time Victoria was probably already dead at the hands of Smith, beaten about the skull by two large rocks and dumped into a sand pit adjacent to Wyckoff Avenue.<br />It didn’t take long for detectives to narrow their search for a suspect. Under questioning, Smith admitted that he had picked up Victoria and said that the two had argued. He gave varying accounts of his whereabouts and couldn’t explain why blood stains of the victim’s type had been found on the trousers he had swiftly discarded. In an excursion to the sand pit, he led police to the spot “where I imagine I struck her with my fist,” though he denounced one of his local acquaintances as the likely murderer."
