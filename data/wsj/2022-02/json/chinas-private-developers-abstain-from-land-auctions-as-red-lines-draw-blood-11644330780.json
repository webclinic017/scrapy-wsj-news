    "body": "BEIJING—China’s embattled private property developers have pulled back from buying new land, punching a hole in the local government funding that is needed to service their mountains of debt, fuel economic growth and pay for leader Xi Jinping’s ambitious social spending vision.<br />Private developers bought just 22% of residential land sold at nationwide auctions that wrapped up last month, according to data compiled by China Index Academy, a research firm focused on real estate. That was half their contribution in a round of sales in early 2021, before strict new limits on developers’ leverage known as the “three red lines” pushed heavily indebted firms—including  China Evergrande Group —into default and made it difficult for many peers to refinance their debt."
