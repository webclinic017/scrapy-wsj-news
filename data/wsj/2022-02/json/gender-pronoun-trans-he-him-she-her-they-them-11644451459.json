    "body": "Regarding Colin Wright’s op-ed “When Asked for Your ‘Pronouns,’ Don’t Answer” (Feb. 5): On a visit to Beverly Hills, Calif., a young man approached me with a petition he wanted me to sign in support of a progressive action. After listening to what he had to say, I politely said I would not sign his petition, nor would I sign one against. He persisted and wanted me to take a position of support, but I just wanted to be left alone—which is what most of us want. I don’t want to be drawn into every issue that our modern world has to offer. Leave me alone.<br />If these issues of gender will not leave us alone and have an effect on fairness in sports, the most effective approach for biological girls may be not to participate. Forego the event and let the self-identified female compete unopposed for a hollow victory. If that happened across the spectrum, the institutions acquiescing to this new ideology would have to take notice and address the fundamental question of fairness."
