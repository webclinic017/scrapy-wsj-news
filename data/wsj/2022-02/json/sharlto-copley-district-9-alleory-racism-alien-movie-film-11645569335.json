    "body": "In Joe Morgenstern’s review of “Ted K” (Film Review, Feb. 18), we read that the star, Sharlto Copley, played a South African white supremacist in the movie “District 9.”<br />While conventional wisdom holds that “District 9” was an allegory for South Africa’s racial strife, it was not a movie about racism. In a woke world, one would hate for Mr. Copley to have to explain himself for portraying a white supremacist when in fact he did not. He portrayed a bureaucrat persecuting aliens. Literal aliens, not the undocumented kind. Again, one must tread lightly in our enlightened times."
