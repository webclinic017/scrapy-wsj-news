    "body": "On the bitterly cold afternoon of Jan. 30, 1649, Charles I, anointed king of England, Scotland and Ireland, stepped through a window of the Banqueting House in Whitehall, London, and onto a wooden scaffold. There, with a single blow, he was beheaded before a horrified crowd.<br />Emerging to meet his death, the king had passed under a ceiling upon which, in happier days, he had commissioned a magnificent painting by Peter Paul Rubens celebrating his own Stuart dynasty’s divine right to rule. Charles’s stubborn adherence to that creed had ignited civil war with a defiant Parliament in 1642, and ultimately brought him to the executioner’s block, wearing an extra shirt against the chill lest spectators should mistake any shivering for fear."
