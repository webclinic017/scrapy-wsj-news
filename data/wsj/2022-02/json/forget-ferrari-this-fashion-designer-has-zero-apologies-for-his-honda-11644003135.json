    "body": "Jerome Peel, 31, the New York-based owner of the fashion label Peels, on his 1991 Honda NSX, as told to A.J. Baime.<br />When my father, Jerome Peel Sr., was a kid, he worked on  Porsche s. When he was about 21, he built a Porsche race car out of spare parts. But later, he was pretty much broke, so he switched to  Honda s. Today, he has seven or eight Hondas. He is a Honda genius, and he actually has a collection of Honda motors in his living room. My first car was a Honda Civic hatchback, then I moved on to an Acura Integra GS-R (Acura being the higher-end Honda brand in the U.S.)."
