    "body": "As a longtime ESG investor, I don’t disagree with much of what James Mackintosh has written in “Streetwise: Why the Sustainable Craze Is Flawed” (Markets, Jan. 24). Understanding risk is what good investors do. The ESG marketing machine has gotten ahead of itself in what it promises investors.<br />I have a different view of the changes needed for companies to be more socially responsible and mitigate risk. Many make noises about valuing stakeholders, but creating real value requires deep cultural change. Investors attuned to ESG are able to spot trends early. Whether these trends are financially material in the short term is a different story. While the cost of aligning with the future may be high today, that is where value will be created. Ignoring ESG issues over the long term will bring even higher costs."
