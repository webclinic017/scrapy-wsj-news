    "body": "After an underwhelming update from Uber Eats parent  Uber Technologies  last week, U.S. food delivery market-share leader  DoorDash  had investors eating out of its hand on Wednesday evening.<br />The company said it boosted gross order value for its Marketplace business, which includes delivery, by 70% in 2021, after more than tripling it in each of the preceding three years. Fourth-quarter results show it continues to dominate the delivery space domestically and has big ambitions to continue its success abroad."
