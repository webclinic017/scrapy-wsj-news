    "body": "I lead BlackRock’s proxy-voting team. We cast votes based on one principle: enhancing shareholder value for our clients (“Calling out ‘Emperor’ Larry Fink,” Review & Outlook, Feb. 18).<br />Our clients save for long-term goals, so we take a long-term perspective. How companies engage with employees and adapt to the energy and technology transitions will affect our clients’ long-term returns, so they factor into our voting decisions."
