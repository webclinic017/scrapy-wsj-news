    "body": "OTTAWA—Police in the Canadian capital are trying to prevent protesters who have parked an estimated 500 heavy-duty trucks in the downtown core from obtaining fuel, food and other supplies in a stepped-up effort to end the 11-day demonstration against Covid-19 vaccine mandates.<br />Ottawa police were more aggressive in tactics over the weekend, as local politicians demanded an immediate end to the protest, organized by a group named Freedom Convoy 2022. The protest has clogged up traffic in the city and upended residents’ day-to-day lives. Protesters have vowed to stay in the capital until all governments in Canada drop mandates related to Covid-19 vaccination, as well as other economic and social restrictions."
