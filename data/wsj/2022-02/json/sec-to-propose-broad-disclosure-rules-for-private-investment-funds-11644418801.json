    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”Regulators proposed expansive new requirements for private investment funds Wednesday as part of a widening effort to police a rapidly growing but relatively opaque corner of the capital markets.<br />In a Wednesday morning meeting, the Securities and Exchange Commission passed a proposal that would force hedge funds and private-equity funds to provide basic disclosures to their investors and guard against conflicts. The Democrat-controlled commission approved the proposal by a 3-to-1 vote. The agency will now seek public comments for at least two months before issuing a final rule."
