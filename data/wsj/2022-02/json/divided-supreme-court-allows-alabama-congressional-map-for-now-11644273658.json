    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court Monday granted Alabama’s request to reinstate its electoral map that has produced a House delegation of six white Republicans and one Black Democrat, temporarily blocking a lower-court order requiring the state to draw a second district where Black voters would hold political power.<br />The justices voted 5-4 to leave in place a political map drawn by the state’s GOP-controlled Legislature while the state’s appeal proceeds before the Supreme Court. The case will be heard during the court’s next term beginning in October, maintaining the state’s map through the 2022 midterm elections."
