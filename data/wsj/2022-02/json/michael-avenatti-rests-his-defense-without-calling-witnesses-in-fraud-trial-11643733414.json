    "body": "Disgraced celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti rested his defense Tuesday against federal fraud allegations without calling a single witness and declining to testify in his own defense.<br />The move was the latest twist in a trial that already saw Mr. Avenatti drop his defense lawyers in favor of representing himself. In recent court filings, Mr. Avenatti provided a list of 11 possible defense witnesses and said he would likely testify himself, though U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan later ruled that some of Mr. Avenatti’s proposed witnesses couldn’t be called."
