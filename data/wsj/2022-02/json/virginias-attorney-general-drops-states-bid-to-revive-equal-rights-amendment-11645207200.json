    "body": "WASHINGTON—Virginia’s new Republican attorney general dropped his state’s effort to compel federal certification of the Equal Rights Amendment, saying the proposal’s ratification period expired decades ago and further litigation would be pointless.<br />The move by Attorney General Jason Miyares, in a court filing Friday, delivers a blow to a once largely uncontroversial effort to anchor equal rights regardless of sex in the Constitution, giving women equal footing in the workplace and before courts. The proposed amendment, supported by both political parties when it passed Congress in 1972, lost momentum in pursuit of the necessary ratifications as conservatives argued it could expose women to the military draft, disadvantage them in child-custody hearings, and ease arguments for abortion rights."
