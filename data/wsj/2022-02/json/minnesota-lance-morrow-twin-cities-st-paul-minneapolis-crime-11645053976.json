    "body": "If Lance Morrow accepts the offer from a Mankato resident to visit and experience our signature Minnesota nice (Letters, Feb. 14), he should avoid the Twin Cities metro area, where around 60% of the state’s population lives. The downtowns are quite different from Mankato and more in tune with Mr. Morrow’s description in “How Minnesota Went From Tom Sawyer to Huck Finn” (Cross Country, Jan. 22).<br />If Mr. Morrow happens to see a guy wearing his Paul Bunyan plaid wool coat, yes, that is our governor, dressing up for another photo op."
