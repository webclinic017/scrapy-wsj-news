    "body": "The documentary exposé can serve several purposes. Uncover a mystery. Point a finger. Generate outrage—something best accomplished when no one culpable will even concede that a crime has been committed.<br />Such is the case in “The Missing Children,” which is not an entirely new story—though not being new only makes it more outrageous. It was in the mid-’70s that a couple of Irish schoolboys playing at a construction site in County Galway literally stumbled into a pit that they found held human bones, which were presumed to be part of a potato-famine-era grave—it was blessed by a priest and a Catholic shrine erected over it. (One of those boys, now white-haired, recounts the find.) More than 30 years later, amateur historian Catherine Corless, looking into the history of the St. Mary’s Mother and Baby Home in Tuam (pronounced “tomb”) determined that the remains must have been of infants who had been under the care of the Bon Secours religious order, whose own records said that 796 children had died there between 1922 and 1961."
