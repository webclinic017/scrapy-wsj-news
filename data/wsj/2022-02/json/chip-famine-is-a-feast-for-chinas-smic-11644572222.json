    "body": "China’s semiconductor giant is feasting on profits as companies everywhere run out of chips. The big question now is how to prepare for leaner times ahead. Heavy investments in new capacity are easy to defend now, but if chip prices cool in the years to come—especially for more mature technologies—the company could find itself in a trickier spot.<br />Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. , or SMIC, reported on Thursday record revenue and profit margins for last quarter. Its sales grew 61% year over year for the three months ending in December, while its net profit more than doubled. SMIC, China’s largest foundry—meaning a chip maker that manufactures chips to spec for customers—has been a particular beneficiary of the semiconductor shortage caused by the pandemic."
