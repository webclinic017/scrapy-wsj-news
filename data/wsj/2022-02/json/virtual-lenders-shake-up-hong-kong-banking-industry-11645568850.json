    "body": "An upstart group of virtual banks has gained a toehold in Hong Kong, luring consumers from bricks-and-mortar lenders in the Asian financial hub with offerings such as numberless credit cards that promise more security and mobile games that churn out cash prizes.<br />The eight digital lenders, mostly backed by large banks and other corporations, operate only online or via mobile phones and have no physical branches. They have been expanding aggressively in one of Asia’s most banked cities since starting operations in 2020, leading other traditional banks to follow suit with their own digital offerings."
