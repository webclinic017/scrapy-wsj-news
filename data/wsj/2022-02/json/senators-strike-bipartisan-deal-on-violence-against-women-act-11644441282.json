    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senators have struck a bipartisan deal to work to reauthorize a landmark domestic-violence bill that lapsed in 2019, after Democrats dropped their effort to add contentious language related to guns.<br />The Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA, was enacted in 1994 to provide funding for prosecutions of domestic violence crimes, as well as for shelters and other programs to aid victims of abuse."
