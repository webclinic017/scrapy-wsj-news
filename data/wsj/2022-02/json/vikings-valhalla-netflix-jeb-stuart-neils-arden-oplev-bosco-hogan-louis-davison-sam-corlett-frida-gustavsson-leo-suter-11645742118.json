    "body": "Blood, glory and longships are among the hallmarks of “Vikings: Valhalla,” which is set just 100 years after the popular and long-running “Vikings,” but with social anxieties that seem as fresh as yesterday. Or tomorrow. Tribalism, nationalism, fundamentalism, evangelism. Vengeance. The Norsemen can’t get along with England. But neither can they get along with each other.<br />The friction is not entirely their fault, at least as related in this eight-part, history-adjacent drama created by Jeb Stuart (“Die Hard,” “The Fugitive”). There was in fact a St. Brice’s Day Massacre of England’s resident Danes in the year 1002, ordered by Aethelred the Unready (Bosco Hogan), and a subsequent Viking invasion that had to be countered by Aethelred’s somewhat unprepared son, Edmund (Louis Davison). But be advised: “Vikings: Valhalla”—Valhalla being a kind of heaven, or hall of the fallen heroes in Norse mythology—is not instructional. It is, rather, fiercely emotional, often overwrought and populated by characters well-acted and fully engaging."
