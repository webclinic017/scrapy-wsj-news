    "body": "The exclusion of energy from sanctions has calmed immediate fears of a deep market impact from the war in Ukraine. But one sector still looks as exposed as it is to every crisis: airlines.<br />Among the 125 European subsectors in the Stoxx Europe 600 index, airlines rank fourth from the bottom in terms of stock performance between Feb. 10 and Feb. 24. They staged a strong rebound Friday, joining the rest of the stock market, but remain down 7% this month."
