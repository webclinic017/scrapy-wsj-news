    "body": "Citigroup Inc.  disclosed Monday it had nearly $10 billion in total exposures to Russia at the end of 2021, some of which sit in a consumer bank it has been trying to sell and may now be stuck with.<br />The New York giant, which bills itself as the world’s truly global bank, is by far the most exposed of the big U.S. banks to Russia in the midst of a global sanctioning regime that is threatening Russia’s economy after its invasion of Ukraine last week. Russia is, nonetheless, a small part of Citigroup’s $2.29 trillion in assets."
