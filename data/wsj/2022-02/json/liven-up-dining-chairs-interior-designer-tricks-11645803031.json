    "body": "WHEN YOU walk into a dining room equipped with charismatic chairs—seats that deviate from the traditional carbon-copy set, that differ from each other in design or upholstery—the odds that you’ll enjoy an evening of conviviality seem to improve. “If you like order and formality, this might not suit your style,” said New York City interior designer Billy Cotton of upholstering dining chairs in compatible but varied patterns. Toronto-based designer Stephane Chamard, who combines perches of disparate styles but of one color and era, said the eclectic approach “makes for a more relaxed atmosphere.” Manhattan designer Ashley Whittaker covers the back side of dining chairs with a fabric different from the rest of the seat’s upholstery, not only because the trick “keeps a room from being too serious” but for practical reasons. “The back of the chair is a great place to use a more precious fabric such as a Fortuny or an antique textile without worrying about damaging it.”<br />Here, the three designers share the ins and outs of overturning dining-chair convention."
