    "body": "AMC Entertainment  Holdings Inc. struck a deal to refinance expensive debt it took on in the early days of the pandemic, as it vies to revive the investor enthusiasm that made the company a centerpiece of the meme-stock phenomenon.<br />On Wednesday, AMC received investor commitments for a new $950 million bond deal and will use the proceeds to pay off higher-interest debt borrowed in April 2020 as an emergency measure after closing the companyâ€™s nearly 1,000 theaters world-wide, people familiar with the matter said."
