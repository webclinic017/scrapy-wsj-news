    "body": "The New York Times  won a legal victory Tuesday against Sarah Palin’s libel suit, but the cost has been steep. Ms. Palin couldn’t get over the high legal bar of proving “actual malice” to a jury, but the case exposed slipshod editing and how a left-wing narrative skewed the publication’s commentary against an easy political target. In that sense the former Alaska Governor won even in defeat.<br />This was no heroic stand for a free press against a government censor or powerful figure. The case was a purely defensive effort to show that the falsehoods published about Ms. Palin in a 2017 editorial were unfortunate mistakes. The Times’ defense is that it was merely incompetent, not malicious."
