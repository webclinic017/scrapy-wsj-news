    "body": "Sixty years ago on Feb. 20, astronaut John H. Glenn orbited Earth three times. The  Mercury  capsule Friendship 7 placed on top of an Atlas LV-3B launch vehicle (a modified intercontinental ballistic missile) reached a height of 162 miles and a speed of 17,544 miles an hour. After 4 hours and 55 minutes, it splashed down 800 miles southeast of Bermuda. Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin did a single orbit the year before.<br />So yes, the space race was on. “Come on Space Truckin’.” By the 1969 moon landing, it was clear the U.S. had beaten the Soviets, though oddly by using a Soviet-like command-and-control structure, which “Star Trek’s” Romulans and “Star Wars’ ” Galactic Empire would endorse."
