    "body": "President Biden removed any doubt Friday about American expectations about Vladimir Putin’s plans for Ukraine. The Russian President has made up his mind to invade, Mr. Biden said in comments from the White House, and the likely war will include an armed assault to take the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.<br />The U.S. has been close to predicting this for several days, and perhaps Mr. Biden wanted to give the Russian President one more opportunity to consider the consequences of war. The U.S. President said the U.S. and Europe will be firm and united in response, as will America’s political parties. If Mr. Putin thought he would be getting a free ride, Mr. Biden said he is mistaken."
