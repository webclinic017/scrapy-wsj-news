    "body": "Rising goods costs drove U.S. consumer prices up by 7.5% from a year earlier last month. But if you are worried about inflation, that might not be the biggest thing to worry about.<br />The Labor Department’s inflation report Thursday was even hotter than forecasters expected. Economists thought that January’s headline figure would show a 0.4% rise from December, putting it 7.2% higher than a year earlier, rather than the 0.6% gain on the month and 7.5% gain on the year it showed. They thought core prices, which exclude food and energy items to better capture inflation’s trend, would also increase 0.4%, putting them 5.9% higher than a year earlier. Instead, core prices were up 0.6% from December and 6% on the year."
