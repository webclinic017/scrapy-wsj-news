    "body": "WASHINGTON—Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D., N.M.) suffered a stroke and had surgery to ease swelling in his brain, his top aide said Tuesday, leaving Democrats short of a crucial vote in the 50-50 Senate while he recovers.<br />Mr. Luján is currently at the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque being evaluated, said Carlos Sanchez, his chief of staff, in a statement. The stroke was in his cerebellum and was affecting his balance, which led to the decompressive surgery, Mr. Sanchez said."
