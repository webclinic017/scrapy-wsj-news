    "body": "Regarding Daniel Henninger’s column “America’s Mindlessness Epidemic” (Wonder Land, Jan. 27): This ignorant selfishness is so revealed in New York’s Central Park, where I work as a volunteer. I see lawns used as garbage bins for doggy-poop bags; debris tossed into bushes and under benches; paper napkins rolled into bits small enough to wedge between the slats of the park benches; bikers who ride, often at high speeds, on paths reserved for walkers, and are ready to use the f-word if you ask them not to; and beer and soda cans thrown into the Harlem Meer and other pools in the park.<br />These “sins” are minor compared with actual crimes elsewhere in the city, but they indicate a society in crisis. It was a truly sad day for me when a close, aged friend told me that she no longer cared what might happen because she would be dead soon anyway. That’s my nightmare—that no one really cares anymore."
