    "body": "Condé Nast said it turned a profit last year for the first time in years, a feat the publisher of Vogue, Bon Appétit and the New Yorker attributes to strong digital-revenue growth and cost savings from reorganizing its global operations.<br />The company recorded nearly $2 billion in revenue last year, a double-digit-percentage increase from 2020, according to a person familiar with the matter. Condé Nast, a unit of closely held Advance Publications Inc., doesn’t make its financial results public. It declined to disclose the size of its 2021 profit or say for how long it had been unprofitable."
