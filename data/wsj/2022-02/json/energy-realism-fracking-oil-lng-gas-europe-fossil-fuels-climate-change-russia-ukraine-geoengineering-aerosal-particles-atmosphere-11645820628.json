    "body": "Let’s touch on a few energy-related subjects in the wake of Russia’s market-roiling actions in Ukraine.  Exxon  was already riding high on the recovery of oil prices. The world has shown it’s not remotely prepared to do without fossil fuels. And a beneficiary has been Engine No. 1, the hedge fund that fought a noisy battle last year for Exxon board seats, saying it wanted to lead the oil giant away from fossil fuels, a claim the media bought hook, line and sinker.<br />But wait. People invest in oil companies to make money from oil, not wind and solar. Veteran fund manager Chris James, the billionaire founder of Engine Co. 1, could not have been confused on this point. Blather aside, quite clearly he meant to place a bet on Biden priorities and other factors to drive up the price of oil."
