    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Education Department will discharge another $415 million in student debt held by borrowers who said they were defrauded by for-profit schools that misrepresented their graduates’ employment prospects or otherwise swindled them, federal officials said Wednesday.<br />The loans of nearly 16,000 former students are being forgiven under a legal provision known as borrower defense to repayment, which allows students to have their debts erased if they prove that their schools defrauded them."
