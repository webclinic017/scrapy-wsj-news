    "body": "Thousands of truckers and their supporters drove to Canada’s capital over the weekend, demanding an end to vaccine mandates and the reign of Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. They may leave Ottawa with a different scalp: that of Conservative leader Erin O’Toole.<br />At least 35 Conservative members of Parliament on Monday night triggered a leadership vote, and Mr. O’Toole could be ousted by his caucus as early as Wednesday. Even if the Conservative leader survives, there is blood in the water."
