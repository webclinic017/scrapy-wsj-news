    "body": "ONIONS AND LEEKS melted into a sweet and delicate sauce seasoned with fresh thyme; batons of smoked bacon and the unmistakable depth of a good Gruyère; smoked paprika, fiery harissa and cool, tangy feta: If this isn’t the sort of thing that comes to mind when you think baked pasta, think again. Even comfort food needs an update, or at least a new angle. And this is the season to experiment.<br />Nobody in my household likes a classic lasagna made with meat ragù or tomato sauce. They say they find it too heavy, too reminiscent of bad cafeteria lunches. I beg to differ, but lasagna isn’t the sort of meal one prepares just for oneself. My revisionist lasagna made with melted alliums satisfies my own cravings and my family’s desire for something surprising. It couldn’t be simpler, but allow 45 minutes to slowly soften the onions and leeks over low heat until they are translucent and mellow. Add layers of noodles, Parmesan and béchamel, and the result is really quite elegant."
