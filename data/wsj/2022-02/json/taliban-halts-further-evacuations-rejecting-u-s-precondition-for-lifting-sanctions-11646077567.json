    "body": "The Taliban said Sunday that Afghans will no longer be allowed to leave the country without a good reason, and women will be barred from traveling without a chaperone, rejecting a key U.S. demand before the lifting of sanctions and the recognition of its government.<br />Since the Taliban seized power last summer, thousands of Afghans have continued to try to flee Afghanistan fearing reprisal for their past affiliation with the U.S. and to escape a sharp economic downturn that has left millions on the brink of starvation. The Taliban didnâ€™t outline what reasons it would approve for leaving the country."
