    "body": "WASHINGTON—Legal memos filed in recent days in the case against a former lawyer for the 2016 Clinton campaign, Michael Sussmann, reignited disputes over special counsel John Durham’s continuing probe into the origins of the FBI’s investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.<br />Late Friday, Mr. Durham said in a filing that his office would show at Mr. Sussmann’s trial that people affiliated with Donald Trump’s Democratic opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, worked to exploit nonpublic internet traffic data they had access to, including from the White House, to establish a narrative tying Mr. Trump to Russia. The filing suggested the data included the early days of the Trump presidency."
