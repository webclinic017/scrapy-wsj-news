    "body": "Anti-Semitism and violence against Jews are on the rise in the U.S. For many Americans this reality has been lost in a two-year-long dystopian fog, but anti-Semitism was resurgent even before the pandemic. The 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and the recent Texas hostage standoff shock us, yet they have become customary.<br />The pretext of the “new” anti-Semitism is hatred of Israel, which justifies Jew hatred anywhere. Other forms, like the popularity of “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” endure. Jews are said to have a plan to dominate the world, spread drugs and venereal diseases, and much else. The crimes of capitalism and communism alike are blamed on Jews. Anti-Semitism is resurgent on the political right, which feels alienated from governing institutions. And the most refined anti-Semitism continues to be taught on university campuses."
