    "body": "The Federal Reserve’s board of governors voted Friday to designate Jerome Powell as its leader once his four-year term expires on Saturday, pending his confirmation by the Senate.<br />The move is largely procedural because President Biden has nominated Mr. Powell to serve a second four-year term, but the Senate hasn’t voted on his confirmation. Mr. Powell is expected to be confirmed with a bipartisan majority following an unremarkable Senate hearing last month."
