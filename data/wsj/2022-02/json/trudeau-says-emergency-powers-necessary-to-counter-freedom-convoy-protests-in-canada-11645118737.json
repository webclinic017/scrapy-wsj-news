    "body": "OTTAWA—Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau defended the government’s decision to invoke extraordinary emergency powers to break up protests against Covid-19 mandates, saying the powers represent a proportional response to blockades that have stymied the capital and disrupted cross-border trade.<br />“For the good of all Canadians, the illegal blockades and occupations have to stop and the borders have to remain open,” Mr. Trudeau said in a speech in the House of Commons on Thursday. “Here in Ottawa, law enforcement now has more tools and resources in order to give the people of this city their jobs, neighborhoods and freedoms back.”"
