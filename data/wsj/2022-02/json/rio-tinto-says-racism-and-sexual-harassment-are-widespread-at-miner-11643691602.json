    "body": "SYDNEYâ€”When one  Rio Tinto  PLC worker reported she had been sexually harassed by a colleague, a manager told her it had probably been meant as a joke. Another employee said they felt so unsafe in the presence of a male manager that they had contemplated suicide.<br />Other employees at the global mining company spoke of frequent bullying by managers, racist comments, and a culture that consistently tolerates inappropriate behavior. Many were scared to report abusive behavior in case it harmed their careers."
