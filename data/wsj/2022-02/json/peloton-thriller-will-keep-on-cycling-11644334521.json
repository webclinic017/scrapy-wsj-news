Don’t expect a happily ever after to come overnight.<br />Peloton co-founder John Foleyis stepping down as chief executive and will become executive chair, the company said Tuesday morning. Succeeding him is former Spotify Technology and Netflix chief financial officer, Barry McCarthy, who also will join the company’s board. In conjunction with that announcement, the company reported financial results for the period ended Dec. 31 (hastily rescheduled from the afternoon) and issued guidance for the remainder of the year. Spoiler alert: They weren’t good."
