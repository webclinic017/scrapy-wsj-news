    "body": "The clamor and drama surrounding travel nurses’ pay is indicative of a larger issue: the unsustainable design of our healthcare system and the undue strain it places on healthcare workers (“Steep Nurse Pay Raises Irk Hospitals,” U.S. News, Feb. 9).<br />As a nurse in this pandemic, I am disheartened see my travel-nurse colleagues make significantly more than I do.
