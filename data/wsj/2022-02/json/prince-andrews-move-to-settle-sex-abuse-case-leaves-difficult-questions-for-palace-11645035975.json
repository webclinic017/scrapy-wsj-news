    "body": "LONDON—Prince Andrew’s decision to settle allegations of sexual abuse removes the immediate threat of a highly publicized trial, but the aftershocks of the yearslong scandal continue to reverberate in Buckingham Palace.<br />Virginia Giuffre filed a suit last year alleging disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell forced her to have sex with the royal when she was a teenager in the early 2000s. Prince Andrew repeatedly denied the charges, said he had never met Ms. Giuffre and then requested a jury trial."
