    "body": "If Boris Johnson were trying to goad his Tory colleagues into ousting him as U.K. Prime Minister, he couldn’t do better than the response his government unveiled Thursday to a cost-of-living crisis. What should have been a chance to reset his embattled administration has become a master class in how not to govern as a conservative.<br />Household budgets took further knocks Thursday in what is fast becoming an emergency for millions of Britons. The energy regulator announced that starting in April the cap on household energy prices will rise 54%, potentially adding nearly £700 ($950) a year to the average family bill. The Bank of England, meanwhile, raised its benchmark interest rate another quarter-percentage point to 0.5%, following an increase in December."
