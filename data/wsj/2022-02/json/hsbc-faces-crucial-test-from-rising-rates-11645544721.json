    "body": "HSBC  has made steady progress in its strategic overhaul during tough times. Rising rates are a boon, but also an important test, of management’s newfound cost discipline.<br />The Asia-focused bank published strong full-year results on Tuesday. Profit before tax doubled over 2020, flattered by a U.K. tax credit that partially offset higher loss provisions on Chinese real-estate loans. The bank’s solid core capital buffer of 15.8% helped fund an additional $1 billion share buyback. Management upgraded most of its financial targets for the final year of its three-year overhaul, but the bank’s shares barely budged in Tuesday trading."
