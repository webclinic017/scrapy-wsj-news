    "body": "Colin Wright correctly points out that replying to the question, “What are your pronouns?” implies acceptance of the premise that humans can choose their gender (“When Asked for Your ‘Pronouns,’ Don’t Answer,” op-ed, Feb. 5). His suggestion not to reply to the pronoun impertinence makes good sense.<br />But matters are sometimes more complex. The only person to ask me for pronouns did so in bureaucratic mode as I was scheduling a medical appointment. Not wanting to jeopardize my health for a principled stand on pronouns, I unhappily mumbled “he/his.” Some employers and schools require staff and students to supply pronouns. In such cases, rudeness, sarcasm or refusal do not work."
