    "body": "WHEN HOUSE CATS are anxious or frightened, their inner panther spurs them to seek higher ground, clambering up onto a bookshelf or atop a fridge, said Dr. Kelly Ballantyne, a veterinary behaviorist at Insight Animal Behavior Services in Chicago. Many owners—eager to spare their ceramics or plants from leaping felines—install cat trees. These are invariably clad in beige wall-to-wall that one would never install on one’s own floors. The towers’ fuzzy tiers may be ideal for jumping sprees, naps and scratching, but “let’s face it, they can be a bit unsightly,” said Dr. Ballantyne.<br />Quite a few homeware designers—perhaps as weary as we are of the styleless cat condos available—have conceived alternatives. We’ve chosen four design-forward examples and asked interior designer Allegra Muzzillo of ACM Interiors in Brooklyn, N.Y., a cat mom of two, for her thoughts. Your pet might be less picky than you, however, said Dr. Ballantyne: Any cat tree is “basically going to increase the square footage of your home from your cat’s perspective.”"
