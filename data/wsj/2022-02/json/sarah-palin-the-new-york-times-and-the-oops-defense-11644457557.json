    "body": "The former editorial page editor of the  New York Times  is making the same claim about his intent in publishing an outrageous falsehood about Sarah Palin that he made in 2017. If the jury credits his argument in 2022, victims of journalistic malpractice may find it nearly impossible to win libel cases against media organizations.<br />Former Times editor James Bennet testified this week in the jury trial of Ms. Palin’s defamation case against his former newspaper. Back in 2017, the Times published an editorial containing fake news about the former Alaska governor and GOP vice-presidential candidate. In the editorial, which followed the shooting of Rep. Steve Scalise and others, the Times recycled a bogus claim that Ms. Palin had incited Jared Lee Loughner to shoot Rep. Gabby Giffords in 2011. The false allegation hinged on the publication of a map targeting swing congressional districts that was published by a political organization tied to Ms. Palin. The smear had been debunked years ago—including in the pages of the New York Times. There was no evidence that Loughner had ever even seen the map."
