    "body": "CONTEMPLATING A VACATION in the era of Covid inevitably involves a slew of “what ifs” that could force you to cancel and potentially lose the money you put down. Most travel experts recommend insuring any trip that costs more than a few thousand dollars. From there, it gets complicated. Policies range from simple “check the box” protection that airlines push at checkout to comprehensive plans that cover all manner of mishaps, like a ski accident or an airline shutting down. Industry officials say the majority of claims filed under these policies are for trip cancellation, typically when the traveler or an immediate family member gets sick or injured before the trip. Premiums range from 5% to 10% of the total trip tab.<br />“It’s not for everyone,” said attorney Jeffrey Miller, a travel law expert at Florida Atlantic University. “A 25-year-old going to Las Vegas doesn’t need travel insurance,” he said. A 55-year-old with an ailing parent back home should consider it for a trip like a cruise, which requires a hefty deposit upfront. Among the factors affecting price and coverage, he said, are a traveler’s age, the type and length of the trip and even where the person lives, since these policies, like other forms of insurance, are regulated by individual states."
