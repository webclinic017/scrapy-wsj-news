    "body": "Don’t let its granola vibe fool you:  Etsy  is a selling machine.<br />The crafts-focused online marketplace sold $4.2 billion in products through its website in the fourth quarter, 16.5% more than a year earlier and safely above the high end of its own lofty guidance and Wall Street’s expectations. Etsy beat the high end of its own revenue guidance by almost 4%."
