    "body": "Employers from  McDonald’s Corp.  to home builder  PulteGroup Inc.  said staffing pressures caused by hiring challenges and surging Covid-19 cases suppressed growth or cut into operations in the fourth quarter. But many companies have already seen those pressures ease, indicating a diminishing impact from the Omicron variant.<br />Staffing challenges were so acute at McDonald’s in mid-December that its restaurants cut back hours by about 10%, Chief Executive Christopher Kempczinski said on a conference call with analysts last month. As of late January, only 1% of McDonald’s restaurants still had reduced hours, he said."
