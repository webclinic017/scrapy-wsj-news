    "body": "I RECENTLY went looking for wines that weren’t easy to find. They weren’t coveted grand crus from Burgundy or cult wines from Napa. My search was focused on something much more ordinary yet seemingly much more elusive: a good wine for $10 a bottle.<br />There are plenty of wines at this price and lower, but I imposed certain criteria: The wine had to be more than some grocery-store staple produced in a wine factory in oceanic amounts; I also wanted a wine that wasn’t just drinkable but possessed some character and even a bit of history. Every bottle I tried was priced around the $10 mark. I covered a fair swath of the world in my search for bargain wines, from Chile and Argentina to South Africa, Spain, Italy, France, New Zealand and Australia. Sadly, I couldn’t find any wines made in the U.S. that fit all my criteria."
