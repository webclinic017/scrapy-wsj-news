    "body": "OTTAWA—Police in Ottawa began towing heavy-duty trucks while dozens of officers moved in formation to make more arrests as they ramp up efforts to bring an end to a 22-day demonstration against Covid-19 vaccine mandates that has paralyzed the capital’s downtown.<br />On the periphery of the main protest zone Friday, several tow trucks were taking away heavy-duty trucks, recreational vehicles and SUVs that were part of the Freedom Convoy protest. Tow trucks had yet to make their way to the main streets in front of Canada’s parliament buildings, where the bulk of the roughly 400 vehicles have been parked for three weeks."
