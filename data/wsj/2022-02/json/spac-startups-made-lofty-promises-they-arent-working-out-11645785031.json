    "body": "A startup battery maker that wooed investors with rapid growth forecasts said it would miss its revenue target by as much as 89%.

An electric bus company that planned to boost revenue faster than any U.S. startup ever told investors to disregard its projections.<br />Dozens of startups that went public in a pandemic-fueled stock market frenzy are missing the projections they used to win over investors, many by substantial margins and just a few months after making those forecasts."
