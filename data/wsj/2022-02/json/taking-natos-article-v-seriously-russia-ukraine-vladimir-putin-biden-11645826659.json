    "body": "Vladimir Putin’s likely conquest of Ukraine raises an uncomfortable question: Could Russia next attack a member of NATO? The alliance had better prepare for the possibility because the Russian dictator has all but promised to test it.<br />“The United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power,” President Biden said Thursday. “There is no doubt—no doubt that the United States and every NATO ally will meet our Article V commitments, which says that an attack on one is an attack on all.”"
