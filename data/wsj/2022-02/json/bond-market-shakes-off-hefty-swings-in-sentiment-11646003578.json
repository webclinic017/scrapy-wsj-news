    "body": "A volatile market week spurred in part by the Russian attack on Ukraine has done little to change investor expectations that U.S. interest rates will rise steadily throughout 2022.<br />Yields on U.S. government bonds tumbled on Feb. 24 after Russia attacked Ukraine, reflecting investor concerns that the clash could hit economic growth, particularly in Europe. Yields then pared the decline during the U.S. session, a sign that investors are continuing to bet that the economic impact of the war will likely be contained."
