    "body": "The Feb. 4 meeting in Beijing between Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping makes it official: The U.S. and its allies now face an axis of autocracy stretching from the Baltic to the Pacific.<br />What Russia and China have in common now is more important than what has divided them in the past. They reject the postwar economic and political order that the U.S. and its allies created. They are revanchist powers determined to regain territories they believe were separated unjustly from their homelands. They endured extended periods of national humiliation, which they are replacing with assertive national pride. And they see democracy as a threat, both inside and outside their borders."
