    "body": "Stephen Breyer reshaped aviation in America. Justice Breyer, who joined the Supreme Court in 1994 and plans to retire this summer, has cited his research for the Airline Deregulation Act as among his best and most significant work.<br />A native San Franciscan, Mr. Breyer became a fan of Pacific Southwest Airlines, an intrastate airline that was founded in 1949. PSA, which operated until 1988, was one of the countryâ€™s first low-cost, low-fare carriers. In 1958 PSA flew between Oakland and Burbank, Calif., for $9.95 each way, equivalent of roughly $95 today."
