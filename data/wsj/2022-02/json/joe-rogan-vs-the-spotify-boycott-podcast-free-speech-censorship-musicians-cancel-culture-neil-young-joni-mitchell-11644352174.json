    "body": "Editor’s note: In this Future View, students discuss the Joe Rogan and Spotify controversy. Next week we’ll ask, “So far, viewership of the Beijing Winter Olympics has been extremely low. Is this a reflection of a loss of interest in sports, a decline in identification with nation-states, or a judgment on the evils of the communist regime in China? Or is something else the cause of the collective yawn?” Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before Feb. 15. The best responses will be published that night.<br />"
