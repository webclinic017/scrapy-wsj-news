    "body": "Audie Norman signed up for  Comcast Corp.’s  Peacock last summer after hearing that the streaming service made it possible to watch the Tokyo Olympics without a pay-TV subscription, which he hasn’t had in at least a decade.<br />When the 42-year-old Macon, Ga., resident and his wife, Julia, tried to watch the Olympics’ opening ceremony—Ms. Norman’s favorite event—he realized it wasn’t available on the service. Neither were most Olympic competitions, which were broadcast live exclusively on NBC and its sister cable channels, which like Peacock are owned by Comcast’s NBCUniversal unit."
