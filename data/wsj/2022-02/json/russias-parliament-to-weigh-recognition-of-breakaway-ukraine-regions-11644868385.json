    "body": "MOSCOW—Russian legislators will Tuesday consider proposals urging President Vladimir Putin to formally recognize the separatist-controlled regions of eastern Ukraine as independent states, in a move that could justify Moscow’s incursion into an area it no longer considers to be Ukrainian territory.<br />The State Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament, said Monday it would consider draft resolutions submitted by the ruling United Russia party and Russia’s Communist Party calling on Mr. Putin to acknowledge the sovereignty of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk in Ukraine’s Donbas region."
