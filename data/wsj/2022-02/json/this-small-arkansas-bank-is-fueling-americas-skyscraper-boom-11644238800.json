    "body": "The most prolific lender to Manhattan property developers isn’t Well Fargo & Co. or  Citigroup Inc.  or any of the other big global banks. It is  Bank OZK ,  which not that long ago was an obscure lender from Little Rock, Ark.<br />The bank has become one of the country’s most aggressive financiers of skyscraper construction. OZK’s chief executive, George Gleason, said on a recent earnings call that the lender could issue its biggest ever construction mortgages in 2022."
