    "body": "In “China’s 5G Soars Over America’s” (op-ed, Feb. 17), Graham Allison and Eric Schmidt call for the Biden administration to build a “national highway system” for 5G wireless networks. This is consistent with Mr. Schmidt’s previous calls for a nationwide wireless wholesale network managed by the federal government and anointed government contractors. A similar idea was also proposed by some Trump administration officials before it was criticized on a bipartisan basis and buried. Does this op-ed foretell a new push toward a nationalized 5G regime?<br />Instead of relying on a government-run wireless operator, let’s stick with what made the U.S. the world leader in 4G: the entrepreneurial brilliance of the private sector investing risk capital. The authors omit that the U.S. wireless industry will have invested almost $300 billion in 5G infrastructure when all is said and done. But if they are looking for taxpayer dollars, last year’s infrastructure legislation will contribute $62 billion more on broadband, on top of the Federal Communications Commission’s $9 billion annual outlays in direct and indirect broadband support."
