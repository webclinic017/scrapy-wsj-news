    "body": "Doctors are increasingly refusing to treat the unvaccinated. Physicians in Alabama, Florida, the District of Columbia and Toronto have dismissed unvaccinated patients from their practices. A Texas task force has considered reserving beds in intensive-care units solely for the vaccinated.<br />Among my fellow bioethicists, incredulity and anger run high against so-called antivaxxers. Behind closed doors I’ve heard repeated calls to punish them by charging higher insurance premiums, withholding scarce medications or refusing treatment."
