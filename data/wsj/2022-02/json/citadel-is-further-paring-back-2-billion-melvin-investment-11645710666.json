    "body": "Citadel LLC is further paring back its $2 billion investment in Melvin Capital Management after the hedge fund stumbled in its effort to recover from a near collapse triggered by surges in  GameStop Corp.  and other “meme stocks” early last year.<br />Citadel in late January asked to redeem half the money the firm and its partners have left in Melvin’s hedge fund, after originally halving their investment late last year, as Melvin racked up double-digit losses for the second January in a row, people familiar with the matter said. The latest redemption request would be paid out at the end of March, the people said."
