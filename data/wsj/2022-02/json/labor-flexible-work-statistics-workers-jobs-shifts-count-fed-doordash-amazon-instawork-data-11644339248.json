    "body": "More than six million people disappeared from the Labor Department’s count of hourly paid workers between 2019 and 2021. They didn’t just vanish. Many found ways of working that expose a blind spot in government policy while transforming the economy. They signed up for flexible working apps such as  DoorDash ,   Amazon  Flex, Trusted Health and the one from my company, Instawork—apps that match hourly workers with local businesses on a shift-by-shift or task-by-task basis.<br />Yet despite the apps’ popularity, the Labor Department rarely publishes statistics on flexible work. The last report on “Contingent and Alternative Employment Arrangements” came out in 2018. Such government counts as the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey can easily miss flexible workers. While a full-time worker who takes vacation or sick leave will still show up as employed, a flexible worker who does the same will be classified as outside the labor force. The Labor Department’s count of self-employed people isn’t much better, it rose by only about 100,000 between 2019 and 2021, even as flexible work was taking off. Flexible workers—especially those in hourly paid professions—fell off the department’s radar."
