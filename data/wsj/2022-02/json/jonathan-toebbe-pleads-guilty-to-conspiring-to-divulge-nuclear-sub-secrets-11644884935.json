    "body": "A U.S. Navy engineer pleaded guilty Monday to charges that he tried to sell highly sensitive nuclear-submarine secrets to a foreign government, in an agreement that could send him to prison for more than 12 years.<br />Jonathan Toebbe, 43 years old, pleaded guilty in federal court in Martinsburg, W.Va., to a single count of conspiracy to communicate restricted data. The charge carries the possibility of life in prison, but lawyers on both sides agreed to a sentencing range of between 12 and 17 years."
