    "body": "Closing ceremonies for the Beijing Olympics are scheduled for Sunday, and the world should mark the moment by agreeing never to do this again. No, we don’t mean the Olympic Games broadly. Where else can fans of skiing and rifle shooting get one-stop shopping, so to speak, other than the quadrennial biathlon? True athletic triumphs can be thrilling.<br />But not in a police state. As American competitors were heading to China, the FBI warned them to leave their iPhones at home and instead bring burner phones, as a way to frustrate the Chinese surveillance state. NBC, which paid handsomely for the TV and digital rights to the Olympics, declined to send announcers to Beijing, citing Covid, and viewership has been historically low. Some nights have pulled half the audience of four years ago."
