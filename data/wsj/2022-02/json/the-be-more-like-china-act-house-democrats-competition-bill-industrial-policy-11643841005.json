    "body": "If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Chinese President Xi Jinping should feel honored by the 2,900-page bill House Democrats claim will make the U.S. more competitive. To counter China, Democrats think America must copy Beijingâ€™s industrial policy.<br />Last summer the Senate passed a $250 billion bill with $54 billion in handouts for the U.S. semiconductor industry and much more for government science bureaucracies. Now with Build Back Better stalled, House Democrats are rushing through their own version that leaves no liberal special interest behind."
