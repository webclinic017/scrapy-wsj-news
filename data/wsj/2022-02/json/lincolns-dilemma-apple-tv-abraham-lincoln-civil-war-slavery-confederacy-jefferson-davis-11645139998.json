    "body": "Apple TV+’s “Lincoln’s Dilemma,” the four-part saga of Abraham Lincoln’s efforts to deal with the issue of slavery, comes richly detailed both in its portrait of the president’s character and that of the nation itself. Lincoln had promised that, as president, he would not touch slavery, which did not prevent a stream of Southern states from seceding upon his ascension to the office. Lincoln, in turn, announced his opposition to any compromise that permitted “the extension of the institution on soil owned by the nation.”<br />Meanwhile, the Confederate states, which were now led by Jefferson Davis, were building what they conceived of as their own country. In the eyes of the white South, Lincoln was a threat. In some parts of the white South, the series reports, people had taken to calling Lincoln “The Prince of Darkness.”"
