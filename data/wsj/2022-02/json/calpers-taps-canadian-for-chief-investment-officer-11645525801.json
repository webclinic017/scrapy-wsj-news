    "body": "The nation’s largest public pension system has once again looked beyond U.S. shores to select a chief investment officer, recruiting a Canadian after an 18-month search.<br />The $478.28 billion California Public Employees’ Retirement System has given the role to Nicole Musicco, a longtime public pension executive, who would become the second woman ever to take charge of investing Calpers’s capital. Ms. Musicco fills the role previously held by Ben Meng, who left in August 2020 amid questions about his personal investments. When he was hired, the U.S. citizen worked in Beijing."
