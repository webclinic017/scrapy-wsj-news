    "body": "WASHINGTON—The select committee investigating the pro-Trump Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol issued a subpoena to Peter Navarro, a former Trump administration adviser, saying that he had openly discussed a plan to stop the certification of President Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election.<br />Mr. Navarro, who advised then-President Donald Trump on trade policy, has described what he called the “Green Bay Sweep” in his book “In Trump Time.” Under that strategy, Republicans would challenge Mr. Biden’s victory in about half a dozen swing states, forcing an extended debate over the validity of results in those states."
