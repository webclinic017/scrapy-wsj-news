    "body": "Ford  Motor Co. and  General Motors Co.  are clamping down on dealerships that are trying to charge more than the sticker price, a tactic that has proliferated amid the car shortage.<br />Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley said Thursday that dealers who engage in this practice will face consequences, including losing supplies of future models. Auto makers set a manufacturer’s suggested retail price, or MSRP, when they ship cars to dealerships. Dealers aren’t required to adhere to them, but under business norms that has been the general practice and expectation."
