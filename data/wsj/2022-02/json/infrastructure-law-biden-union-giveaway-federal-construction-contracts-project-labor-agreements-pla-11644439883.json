    "body": "President Biden’s repeated promises to be America’s “most pro-union president” are about to cost taxpayers a fortune and undermine critical infrastructure investments.<br />On Friday, at a packed union hall in Maryland, Mr. Biden signed an executive order making federal construction contracts greater than $35 million subject to project labor agreements. PLAs are project-specific collective-bargaining agreements that steer public-works contracts to union contractors, granting unions a monopoly on projects procured by federal agencies."
