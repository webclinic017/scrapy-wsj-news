    "body": "WASHINGTON—The hospitalization of Sen. Ben Ray Luján is rippling through the Democratic caucus, setting the stage for potential delays in confirming President Biden’s nominees and advancing his legislative agenda.<br />On Wednesday an aide said that the New Mexico senator could return to work in four to six weeks, barring any complications. His office disclosed a day earlier that Mr. Luján had suffered a stroke last week and had surgery to ease swelling in his brain, adding that he was expected to make a full recovery."
