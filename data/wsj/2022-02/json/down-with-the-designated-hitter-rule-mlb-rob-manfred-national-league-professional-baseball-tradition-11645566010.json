    "body": "It isn’t clear when the nearly three-month old labor dispute between Major League Baseball’s players and owners will end—or if it will. But Commissioner Rob Manfred has already announced that the league has extracted a long-sought concession from the players: He has universalized the designated-hitter rule. It’s the end of an era for professional baseball. For many who love the game, it’s also the end of history.<br />Excusing pitchers from batting in the National League might seem like nothing big—the designated hitter has been a feature of the American League for decades. But it’s a third strike at the heart of the game, and it will saw off part of what has made baseball a school of character for generations of American kids."
