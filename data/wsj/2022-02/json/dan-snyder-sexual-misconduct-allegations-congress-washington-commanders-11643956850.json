    "body": "The National Football League said it would launch a new probe of allegations made by former employees of Washington’s NFL franchise—including an accusation of harassment against team owner Dan Snyder—that were aired at a roundtable hosted Thursday by the the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.<br />The roundtable was part of the congressional committee’s investigation into the NFL’s own probe of misconduct at the club, which last year resulted in the league fining the team $10 million for inappropriate conduct inside the team. The committee launched its inquiry last year after offensive emails related to the NFL investigation led to Jon Gruden’s resignation as coach of the Las Vegas Raiders."
