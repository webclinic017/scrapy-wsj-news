    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The House is poised Friday to approve a sprawling $350 billion initiative to boost U.S. competitiveness with China and other rivals, but differences with the Senate signal struggles ahead in reaching a compromise.<br />The Senate in June passed its $250 billion version of the measure, dubbed the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act. But House leaders waited until the past few weeks to put together their own package, called the America Competes Act, as Congress wrestled with other spending proposals."
