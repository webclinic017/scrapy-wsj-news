    "body": "Another day, another story about criminal anarchy in Eastern Oklahoma. After the Supreme Court’s 2020 McGirt decision, which held that roughly half of Oklahoma is still under Native American reservation jurisdiction, a hopeful view was that state, local and tribal leaders could work through the ensuing challenges. It isn’t playing out that way.<br />Hughes County Sheriff Marcia Maxwell said this month that her office “will no longer be honoring our cross commission with the Muscogee Creek Nation Lighthorse Police.” In theory, deals to cross-deputize local and tribal officers can resolve jurisdictional problems, since whichever authority shows up at the crime scene has the ability to handle it, no matter whether the parties are Native American."
