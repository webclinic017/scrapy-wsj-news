    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Republicans signaled they have no intention of turning the confirmation of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court into an ugly partisan fight, focusing their energies instead on using President Biden’s pick to try to rally conservative voters heading into the midterm elections.<br />While confirmations in recent years have become bitter battles over the future of the court, lawmakers of both parties see the stakes differently this time, largely because Judge Jackson would replace Justice Stephen Breyer, a liberal-leaning jurist, in a court that is balanced 6-3 toward conservatives."
