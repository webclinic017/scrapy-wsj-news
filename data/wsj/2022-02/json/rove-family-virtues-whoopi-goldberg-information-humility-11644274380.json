    "body": "Thanks and condolences to Karl Rove for his heartfelt article on his sister’s passing as a result of Covid-19 (“Requiescat in Pace, Alma,” op-ed, Feb. 3). I am heartened that Mr. Rove did not make her passing a political incrimination of anyone. What we don’t know about life and medicine remains a mystery, but family is our ultimate solace. Thank you, Mr. Rove for reminding us of that truth.<br />John M. Jennings"
