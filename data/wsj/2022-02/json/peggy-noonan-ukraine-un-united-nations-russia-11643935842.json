    "body": "In “The Ukraine Crisis: Handle With Care” (Declarations, Jan. 29), Peggy Noonan praises the “Chicken Kiev” speech, in which President George H.W. Bush told the Ukrainian people not to let “suicidal nationalism based upon ethnic hatred” take hold. He should have lectured the Russians about this. Millions of Ukrainian starved to death in the 1930s due to an artificial famine created by Joseph Stalin. Thousands of Ukrainian Catholic priests were either killed or sent to the Gulag because they would not convert to the Russian Orthodox religion. The Catholic church was persecuted under the czar as well as Communism. Thousands of Ukrainian died at Chernobyl because Mikhail Gorbachev kept the meltdown a secret initially.<br />By declaring independence, Ukraine was simply trying to make sure no more Ukrainians would be killed by Russian nationals. In 1994, Russia, the U.S. and the U.K. signed the Budapest Memorandum, whereby the three powers guaranteed the territorial integrity of Ukraine, which surrendered its nuclear arsenal. Guess how that turned out."
