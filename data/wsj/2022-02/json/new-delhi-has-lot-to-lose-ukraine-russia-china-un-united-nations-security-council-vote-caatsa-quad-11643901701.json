    "body": "For a country that aspires to be a global power, India sometimes makes shortsighted decisions. On Monday it joined Kenya and Gabon in abstaining from a United Nations Security Council vote to discuss the Russian military threat to Ukraine. Ten nations supported the successful American initiative, and only China joined Russia in opposing it. But though the abstention may appear sensible—why take sides in a far-off conflict?—the wider consequences of possible Russian aggression put India at real risk.<br />At first glance, the case for New Delhi not taking sides in a standoff between Washington and Moscow is straightforward. India shares no border with Russia or Ukraine. How they settle their problems is of no obvious concern to New Delhi, and many Indians support trying to walk a tightrope between Russian and U.S. interests. While India’s security ties with the West have strengthened over the past two decades, Moscow is still India’s largest arms supplier by far. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates that Russia accounted for nearly half of India’s arms imports between 2016 and 2020. The Indian air force flies frontline Russian jets. Russia has supplied the Indian navy with frigates as well as India’s only active aircraft carrier and nuclear-powered attack submarine."
