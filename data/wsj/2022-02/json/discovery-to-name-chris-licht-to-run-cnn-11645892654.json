    "body": "Discovery Inc.  has tapped producer Chris Licht to lead CNN after it takes over the cable-news channel, according to people familiar with the matter, turning to a veteran news and late-night TV showrunner to steady a network roiled by the sudden departure of its long-serving president.<br />An announcement of Mr. Licht’s appointment as CNN president is expected next week, some of the people said. Mr. Licht isn’t expected to start at the network until after the completion of the merger of CNN parent WarnerMedia and Discovery, which is expected to happen in the second quarter."
