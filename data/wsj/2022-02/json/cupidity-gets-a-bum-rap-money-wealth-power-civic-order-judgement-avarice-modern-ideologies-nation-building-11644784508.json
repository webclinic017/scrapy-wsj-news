    "body": "The literary scholar Robert Pogue Harrison has written that “most of the world’s woes are due to human cupidity.” The word “cupidity” usually means greed or avarice, and “the love of money is the root of all evil,” as the Bible tells us.<br />Is this dark view of cupidity right? Undoubtedly cupidity was a major factor in the European conquest of Africa, India and the New World, but it wasn’t a major factor in 20th-century history. Hitler, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot, who were responsible for more than 100 million deaths, were driven by dehumanizing ideologies and a lust for power."
