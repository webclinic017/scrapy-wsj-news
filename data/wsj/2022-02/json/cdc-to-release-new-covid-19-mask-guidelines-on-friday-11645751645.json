    "body": "Federal officials plan to release new Covid-19 guidelines on Friday that lay out a new approach for preventing spread of the disease over the longer term, an official said.<br />The updated guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will include new metrics for when communities should consider recommending that masks be worn. Levels of transmission in a community—high, medium and low—will be determined by the number of Covid-19 cases, how many people are in hospitals, and the number of hospital beds in a community, the official said."
