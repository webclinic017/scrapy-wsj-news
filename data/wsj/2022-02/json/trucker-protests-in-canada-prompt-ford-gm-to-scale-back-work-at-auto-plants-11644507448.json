    "body": "The Canadian border city of Windsor, Ontario, said Thursday it would seek a court order to remove demonstrators who have blocked most traffic along a crucial U.S.-Canada trade corridor for four days.<br />Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens said at a press conference that city lawyers would try to argue its case before a judge later Thursday. Should the city succeed, “protesters will be removed to allow for the safe and efficient movement of goods across the border,” the mayor said. “The economic harm that this occupation is having on international trade is not sustainable and it must come to an end.”"
