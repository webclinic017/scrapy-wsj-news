    "body": "KYIV, Ukraine—Turkey and Ukraine signed a free-trade agreement on Thursday and finalized a deal for Ukraine to manufacture Turkish armed drones, in a show of cooperation between the two countries as Russia continued to mass troops on Ukraine’s borders.<br />The visit by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the latest in a string of foreign leaders flocking to Kyiv this week, was part of his effort to broker a solution to the crisis while asserting Turkey’s role as an aspiring power. The trip also shored up global backing for Ukraine in the face of a continuing Russian troop buildup and an escalating war of words between Moscow and the West."
