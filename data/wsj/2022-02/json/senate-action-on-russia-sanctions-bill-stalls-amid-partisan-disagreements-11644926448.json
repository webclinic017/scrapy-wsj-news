    "body": "A disagreement over how to treat a Russian natural-gas pipeline has halted Democratic and Republican efforts to cut a deal on sanctions legislation targeting Russia, just days before many U.S. officials say an invasion of Ukraine is possible.<br />Senators from both parties had hoped to agree on legislation that Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, dubbed the “mother of all sanctions,” part of an effort to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine by ensuring that Moscow would face painful economic measures."
