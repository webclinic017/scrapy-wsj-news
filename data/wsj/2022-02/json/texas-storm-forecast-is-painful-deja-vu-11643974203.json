    "body": "Texas’ grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, didn’t live up to its name last year. This time around, widespread blackouts of that severity seem less likely, but that may not say much about how resilient the system actually is.<br />Texans are understandably worried about the cold spell over the next few days, a painful déjà vu of a year earlier, when the state saw blackouts that left millions without power for days. At least 200 people died as a result of the storm, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. The grid operator, as of Thursday evening, was forecasting demand on Friday morning to peak at roughly 73 gigawatts as temperatures drop. That is worryingly close to the 77 GW in demand the state expected to see at the peak last year; the grid actually ended up serving just under 70 GW at last year’s peak because so many generators were unable to meet demand."
