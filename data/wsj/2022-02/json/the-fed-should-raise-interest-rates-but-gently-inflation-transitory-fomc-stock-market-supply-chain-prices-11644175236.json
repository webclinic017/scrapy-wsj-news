    "body": "The Federal Reserve may be in for a series of tough calls in 2022 and, naturally, all financial-market eyes will be watching. What will the Federal Open Market Committee do? What should it do?<br />Try putting yourself in Chairman Jerome Powell’s shoes. He is smart, thoughtful, and calm—a man who doesn’t go to extremes. He also needs to forge a consensus on a committee that is far from united. Yet he is “graded” every day by thousands of stock and bond traders who, while smart, are often neither thoughtful nor calm—and who go to extremes regularly. The two perspectives don’t match."
