    "body": "Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, is expected to retire after almost three decades in the Senate, according to a person familiar with his plans.<br />Mr. Inhofe, 87, won reelection in 2020. The person said that Mr. Inhofe didnâ€™t have a set retirement date and would aim to serve out the remainder of the year. His retirement would prompt a special election in Republican-leaning Oklahoma and what could be a crowded primary for the open seat."
