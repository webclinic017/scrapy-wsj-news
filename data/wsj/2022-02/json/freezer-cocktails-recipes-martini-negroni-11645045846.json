    "body": "THE FREEZER Martini has long been a pro move at bars: Pre-mix, decant into a bottle and super-chill to a velvety-cold, almost syrupy consistency, ready to pour the moment an order comes in. Throughout the pandemic, it’s been my best at-home hack, too, a real sanity saver at the end of an endless day when my energy is totally zapped.<br />There’s no reason to limit freezer mixology to Martinis, the bar experts say.
