    "body": "Annual inflation in the U.S. rose to 7.5% in January, the highest it’s been since February 1982, when it was 7.6% and declining. This current crisis, economist John Cochrane says, came as “a complete surprise” to the Federal Reserve. “All of the governors who reported forecasts, all of the staff, missed it.” When he calls this an “institutional failure,” he sounds almost kind.<br />Mr. Cochrane, 64, parses the present inflation in a conversation by Zoom from his house in Palo Alto, Calif., near Stanford University, where he’s a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. His tone is wry, and it’s obvious he doesn’t hold this Fed in the greatest esteem. “They’re leading us in the dark,” he says, “with a great pretense of knowing exactly what the map is in front of us.”"
