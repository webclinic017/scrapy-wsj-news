    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The House passed legislation to keep the government funded through mid-March, advancing a temporary fix that will give negotiators time to reach a global agreement on fiscal 2022 spending after weeks of negotiations failed to yield a deal.<br />The 272-162 vote sends the bill to the Senate, which plans to take it up quickly to avoid a partial government shutdown. The government is currently funded through Feb. 18 under an interim measure that keeps spending at levels in place during fiscal 2021, which ended in September."
