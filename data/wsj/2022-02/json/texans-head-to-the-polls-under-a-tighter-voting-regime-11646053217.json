    "body": "AUSTIN, Texas—Rejected mail-in ballots and a drop in mail voting have so far marked the first Texas election since a new voting law went into place, possibly giving a first look at how tightened voting laws in many states may affect the election process.<br />Texans have been casting their ballots in the nation’s first 2022 primary over the past two weeks, either at the polls or by mail. Some 1.6 million Texans cast ballots during early voting, according to the Secretary of State’s Office, compared with 2.6 million total in 2018. Typically, about two-thirds of voters vote early. Election Day is Tuesday."
