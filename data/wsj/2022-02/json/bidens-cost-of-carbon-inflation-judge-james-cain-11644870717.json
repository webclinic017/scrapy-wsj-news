    "body": "The administrative state works in sneaky ways, and one of them is to dodge cost-benefit analysis for regulation. A federal judge on Friday nailed the Biden Administration for the ruse of attempting to use an inflated “social cost” for carbon emissions.<br />Pollutants like NOx and sulfur dioxide have direct public-health and environmental impact on local communities. Carbon, not so. By contributing to global warming, greenhouse gases may pose indirect costs on society. But these are hard to quantify and hotly debated. Some argue carbon emissions have a net benefit."
