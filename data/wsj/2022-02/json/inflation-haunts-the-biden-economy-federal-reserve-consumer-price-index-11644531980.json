    "body": "So how’s the U.S. government’s grand experiment in modern monetary theory turning out? Not well. Consumer prices over the past 12 months rose 7.5%—the most in 40 years—while real wages declined 1.7%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday.<br />The report jolted financial markets, as stocks fell and bond yields rose. But nothing in the January report should be shocking. This is what happens when the government massively expands the money supply and over-stimulates demand. Yet the Federal Reserve and Biden Administration last year dismissed inflation as “transitory.” They have belatedly dropped that line, but they still won’t concede that inflation is becoming more entrenched as price increases have exceeded 5% for eight months in a row."
