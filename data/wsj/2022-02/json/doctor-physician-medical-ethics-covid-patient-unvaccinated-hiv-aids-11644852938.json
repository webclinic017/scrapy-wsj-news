    "body": "L.S. Dugdale’s op-ed critical of physicians’ refusal to treat the unvaccinated (“The Doctor Will See You Now—Wait, Not You,” Feb. 9) recalls for me June 5, 1981, when five men sick with what was called gay-related immune deficiency, later HIV/AIDS, were described in a CDC report.<br />One of the five became my patient. Prejudicial comments, including from physicians, against my caring for these patients flared and spread like wildfire, justified by a false concern for my safety and the false concept that the patients’ complicity in their infection justified, if not mandated, withholding care. Advocacy for withholding care was not extended to, say, alcoholics with chronic liver disease."
