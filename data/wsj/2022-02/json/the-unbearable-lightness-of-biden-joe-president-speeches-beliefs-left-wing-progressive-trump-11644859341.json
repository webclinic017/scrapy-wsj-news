    "body": "When I listen to a speech by President Biden I am occasionally in agreement, often bored, rarely exhilarated and never inspired. I realize that he doesn’t write these speeches; few presidents since Abraham Lincoln have written their own speeches. Ronald Reagan didn’t even write the sentence for which he is best remembered: “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.” Peter Robinson, a speechwriter, did.<br />Something central is missing from President Biden’s speeches, the same thing that is missing from the man. It’s gravitas—that dignity, seriousness and convincing solemnity that powerful public utterances carry. Mr. Biden simply doesn’t have gravitas in him. In his political career he has always seemed less a public servant than an operator, less a president than a backroom politician. Yet, thanks chiefly to American voters’ deep repugnance toward Donald Trump—surely more than half of Mr. Biden’s 81 million votes in 2020 weren’t for him but against Mr. Trump—Joe Biden ended up president."
