    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Rushing to a Weaker Iran Deal” (Feb. 7): When the last Iran deal was being considered, President Obama said it was this deal or war. The deal was extremely weak in its terms and enforcement.<br />We signed the deal and allowed Iran to gain funds. It used them to develop missiles that could deliver nuclear warheads to our shores, advance its nuclear program, carry out terrorism around the world, expand its position in the Middle East and murder Americans and others while repressing its own people."
