    "body": "Regarding your editorial “The Be More Like China Act” (Feb. 3): In the 1980s, the accepted wisdom was that Japan was going to take over everything. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) was a government agency that effectively directed Japanese companies. U.S. politicians wanted to emulate MITI’s great success. Not much later, Japan entered a decadeslong recession.<br />Now it’s China’s totalitarianism, under which corporations bow to politicians’ whims, which Western politicians drool over. Power and control over everything and anything is irresistible to liberals who believe that good comes only from government."
