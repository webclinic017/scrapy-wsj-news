    "body": "Big weddings are back, and the nuptial boom of 2022 means couples and their families are facing big bills for celebrations. Their guests will have to pay up, too.<br />Wedding parties are booking hotel blocks at record rates for longer periods, hotel executives say. Couples are holding events with larger guest lists, reverting to form after a wave of smaller pandemic gatherings, planners and venue managers say. Some are holding multiday events to make up for lost time with friends and family. Guests may want to start saving up now, thanks to both the number of weddings this year and the high lodging rates in many popular markets."
