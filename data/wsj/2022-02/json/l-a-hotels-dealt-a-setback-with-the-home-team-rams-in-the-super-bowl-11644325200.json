    "body": "Los Angeles hotel owners have already suffered a defeat going into Super Bowl Sunday, but they are hoping they can at least keep the score close.<br />Los Angeles county’s SoFi Stadium is the site of the Feb. 13 football final between the favored hometown Rams and the upstart Cincinnati Bengals. Super Bowl weekend is almost always the highlight of the year for the host city’s hotels, which can boost their room rates well above what they would charge for any other weekend as visiting fans compete for a place to stay."
