    "body": "Coca-Cola Co.  and  PepsiCo Inc.  reported higher quarterly sales as the global soda giants pushed through price increases but also felt the squeeze of higher costs for commodities and transportation.<br />Cokeâ€™s organic revenue increased 9% in the quarter ended Dec. 31, driven by a 10% increase in prices. Organic revenue at PepsiCo, which also sells Doritos, Lays potato chips and other packaged foods, rose 11.9% with a 7% increase in prices. Organic revenue strips out currency swings as well as acquisitions or divestitures."
