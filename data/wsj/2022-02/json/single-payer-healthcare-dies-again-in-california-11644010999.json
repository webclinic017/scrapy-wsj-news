    "body": "California is the land where progressive dreams are born, die and reincarnated. Democrats in Sacramento last month revived single-payer healthcare legislation, only to watch it expire again last week. Misguided hope springs eternal.<br />Democrats in the state Senate passed a bill in 2017 for a single-payer health system, but it died in the state Assembly because it didn’t include revenue to pay for the $400 billion annual cost. Last month Assembly progressives resurrected the legislation, plus an enormous tax bill to finance it."
