    "body": "Wittgenstein once said that “a serious and good philosophical work could be written consisting entirely of jokes.” That was quite a bold statement, especially from someone whose own philosophy was gag-free. If anyone is qualified to prove Wittgenstein right, it is Michael Schur, creator of “The Good Place,” a television series that explored the idea of just deserts in a constantly surprising afterlife. Over four seasons, the show pulled off the unlikely trick of turning moral philosophy into comedy gold.<br />Now Mr. Schur distills what he has learned about ethics into “How to Be Perfect,” an enjoyable next step for anyone who watched the series and for anyone else who wants to learn about moral philosophy while avoiding the usual dry earnestness."
