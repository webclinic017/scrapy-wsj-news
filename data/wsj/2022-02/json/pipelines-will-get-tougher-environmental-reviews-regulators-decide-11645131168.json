    "body": "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission voted on Thursday to give more weight to the environmental concerns over new natural-gas pipeline projects when deciding whether to approve them.<br />In a 3-2 vote divided along party lines, commission members changed the policy that lays out the process for reviewing and approving applications for new natural-gas pipeline projects to take into consideration a projectâ€™s environmental impact and the steps a developer has taken to limit that impact. It marked the first policy update since 1999."
