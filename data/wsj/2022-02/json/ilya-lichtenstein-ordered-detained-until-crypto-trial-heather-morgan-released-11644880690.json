    "body": "WASHINGTON—A federal judge ordered the pretrial detention of one member of the young Manhattan couple arrested last week on charges of conspiring to launder billions of dollars in stolen bitcoin, saying the steep penalties the two potentially face and the husband’s alleged familiarity with fake personas meant he could try to flee if released.<br />At a Monday hearing in federal court here, Chief Judge Beryl Howell reversed in part a decision by another judge in New York last week to grant bond for the couple, Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, with restrictions including their parents’ homes being posted as security."
