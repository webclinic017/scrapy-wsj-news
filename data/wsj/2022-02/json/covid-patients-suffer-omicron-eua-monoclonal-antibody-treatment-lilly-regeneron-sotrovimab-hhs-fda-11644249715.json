    "body": "The Biden administration seems to think it knows better than physicians how to practice medicine. But its haphazard micromanagement of monoclonal antibodies to treat Covid-19 has created supply shortages, spread confusion, probably harmed patients, and undermined future treatment.<br />The Food and Drug Administration granted emergency-use authorizations for three monoclonal-antibody preparations to treat Covid patients who have mild to moderate symptoms and are at high risk of progressing to severe illness. These authorizations covered one treatment developed by Regeneron, one from  Eli Lilly  and one from  GlaxoSmithKline .  These laboratory-made proteins provide antibodies to fight Covid faster than our bodies can make them, which reduces the risk of hospitalization and death."
