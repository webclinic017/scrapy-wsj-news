    "body": "With inflation at 7%, the highest rate since 1982, and the Federal Reserve set to tighten monetary policy, you would think the president and Congress would be looking for ways to end the spending spree in Washington. Yet remarkably, bipartisan discussions abound to increase this year’s omnibus appropriations by 16%—almost a quarter of a trillion dollars—pass another round of Covid stimulus, and resurrect the $1.7 trillion Build Back Better bill. It is hard to recall a greater disconnect between economic reality and public policy in American history.<br />This inflation has been driven by an explosion of federal spending, which was set to average 20% of gross domestic product in 2020 and 2021. Instead it doubled to 40% of GDP in a 12-month period as pandemic spending exploded. The multiple stimulus bills did more than fill the gap in aggregate demand. Spending surged as the pandemic shutdown reduced employment and production during that period by an average of 7%. In this textbook case of inflation, $1.20 of income began chasing 93 cents of goods and services, a process greased by expansive monetary policy, and that mismatch sent inflation to a 40-year high."
