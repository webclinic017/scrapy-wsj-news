    "body": "Sarah Bloom Raskin’s confirmation as the Federal Reserve Board’s vice chair for supervision would be the culmination of a two-decade offensive by the left to strand carbon assets (“Sarah Raskin’s Systemic Risk,” Review & Outlook, Feb. 4).<br />Al Gore has preached in Journal op-eds that sustainable capitalism requires aggressive defunding of the oil industry.

The not-yet-reached goal was to convince investors that holding oil and gas stocks was a loser’s game."
