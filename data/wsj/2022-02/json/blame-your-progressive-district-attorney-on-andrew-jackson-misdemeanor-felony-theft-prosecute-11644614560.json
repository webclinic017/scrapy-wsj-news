    "body": "As with most good things, it is possible to have too much democracy. The current district attorneys of Manhattan, Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, San Francisco, Los Angeles and elsewhere are perfect examples.<br />All of them have made it a policy, in the name of “social justice” and “antiracism,” to reduce many serious crimes to lesser offenses, set low or no bail, and decline to prosecute many crimes at all. Alvin Bragg, the new district attorney for Manhattan, for instance, announced on taking office that he would treat all armed commercial robberies—a felony under New York state law punishable by up to 25 years incarceration—as mere misdemeanors, as long as the crime had not resulted in severe bodily injury. Public pressure forced him to retreat on this particular policy, but not on a variety of others that soften the law."
