    "body": "We live in an old farmhouse, and in the winter the white-bellied deer mice come into the house from the fields and woods. Here and there—even here on my desk—they leave tiny scat. The exterminator has come several times this winter, but it seems to be a losing battle. The mice find their way in.<br />A couple of days ago, the exterminator came again, put fresh baits in the basement, and even placed two traps—black plastic trays covered with a sort of superglue—under the kitchen sink. I looked in the morning and saw that one of the traps had caught a vole (which was already dead) and the other a deer mouse, still alive and struggling against the superglue, which held its feet fast."
