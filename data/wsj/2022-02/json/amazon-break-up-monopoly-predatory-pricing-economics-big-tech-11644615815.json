    "body": "Joe Lonsdale makes “The Case for Splitting Amazon in Two” (op-ed, Feb. 8) on the theory that the high-gross-margin Amazon Web Services is supporting a retail operation that sells below cost. But is the retail business really running at a loss? All those warehouses and distribution centers are built with favorable depreciation rules, a legitimate part of the tax code that encourages job-producing business expansion. On a cash basis, Amazon’s retail business is probably nicely profitable.<br />David Robinson"
