    "body": "Near the end of his short lifetime, the comedian Andy Kaufman performed a routine in which he chanted what seemed like random phrases in rhythm while accompanying himself on conga drums. (Even stranger, Kaufman was apparently doing his laundry at the same time.) For some 14 years, a fuzzy video of this has been available on YouTube, yet virtually nobody in the house seems to realize that the lyrics were from “Rock Island,” the opening number of “The Music Man,” a musical whose Broadway revival, starring Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster, is now in previews and opens Feb. 10.<br />The creator of “The Music Man,” Meredith Willson, who died in 1984, at age 82 (the same year as Kaufman, at 35), would have appreciated the joke. When the show originally opened on Broadway, it was a popular and critical success, as well as a Tony winner. But most of the critics only applauded the surface “wholesomeness”: “A genial cartoon of American life,” proclaimed the New York Times, adding “as American as apple pie.” Virtually no one noticed that “The Music Man,” in terms of its musical construction, though perhaps not its subject matter, is as radical and innovative a work as has ever hit the Broadway stage."
