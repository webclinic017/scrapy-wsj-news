    "body": "State governments can do many things with the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds they received under last year’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. One thing they are expressly prohibited from doing is pouring that money into pensions for public employees. Connecticut is doing it anyway.<br />Gov. Ned Lamont’s just-released $48 billion two-year budget proposal funnels $2.9 billion in special deposits into the state employee and teacher pension funds. This is an amount equal to the federal aid the state received under the American Rescue Plan. These special deposits are over and above Connecticut’s regularly scheduled $7.2 billion in state contributions to the two retirement systems."
