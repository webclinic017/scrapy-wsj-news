    "body": "Since Adam Smith, we have known that pursuit of economic self-interest is socially beneficial, but many do not understand this (“Cupidity Gets a Bum Rap” by Stephen Miller, op-ed, Feb. 14). Our minds are wired for zero-sum thinking. Our intuition is that the only way to become rich is to take from others. This was true in the past, when our minds evolved, but is no longer true in our market economy, where there can be growth that benefits everyone.<br />Em. Prof. Paul Rubin"
