    "body": "Herzliya, Israel<br />In recent weeks, a media story dubbed “the Pegasus Affair” by the Israeli news outlet Calcalist has riveted Israelis. The report alleges that the Israeli police used a technological tool called Pegasus to infiltrate phones without a warrant, essentially conducting mass surveillance of high-profile politicians, opposition leaders and activists without proper legal authority. Earlier this week, Deputy Attorney General Amit Marari, along with Shin Bet and Mossad representatives, found no evidence of wrongdoing after conducting an investigation into the allegations. Shortly after, Calcalist announced it was investigating its own reporting."
