    "body": "In “Dump the Character Standard for Baseball’s Hall of Fame” (op-ed, Jan. 29), Fay Vincent sounds like a man of our times. Character, once regarded as the principal measure of goodness, is out of fashion, “hopelessly vague.” All those silly virtues get in the way of winning, whether in politics, business or baseball.<br />“By trying to inject nobility into its election standards,” Mr. Vincent writes, “the Hall of Fame aimed to maintain the old-fashioned view that honors should accrue to the honorable.” Being old fashioned myself, I find that view self-evident. Does the modernist believe that honors ought to accrue to the dishonorable?"
