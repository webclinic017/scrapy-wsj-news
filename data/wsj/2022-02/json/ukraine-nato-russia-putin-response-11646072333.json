    "body": "“What to do now?” you ask in “Putin’s New World Disorder” (Review & Outlook, Feb. 25). “The U.S. doesn’t need to declare war on Russia or send U.S. troops to fight in Ukraine,” you answer. Until and unless America is prepared to do just that—mobilize our surpassing economic and military power—the strong will take advantage of the weak and authoritarians will be on the march.<br />Until and unless America takes ownership of its global responsibility, we are neither exceptional nor indispensable. All the rest is talk, which has gotten the world nowhere good of late."
