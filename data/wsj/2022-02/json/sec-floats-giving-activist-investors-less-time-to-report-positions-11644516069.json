    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Securities and Exchange Commission proposed Thursday to shorten the window for shareholders to alert the market when they build an ownership stake of more than 5% of a company’s stock, a likely setback to activist investors.<br />The proposed rule would reduce the deadline for disclosing such equity positions to five days from 10 days, among other changes, the SEC said. It would also deem holders of some derivative securities to be “beneficial owners” of the underlying company’s stock if the instruments are held “with the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of the issuer.”"
