    "body": "The Internal Revenue Service is the motor that keeps America’s government running, and it is sputtering. Its computer systems are more than 50 years old. Taxes are going unpaid because returns aren’t being processed. Phone calls go unanswered and correspondence takes almost a year to process. The caseload of the Taxpayer Advocate Service—a division that “helps taxpayers solve problems with the IRS and recommends changes to prevent them assists taxpayers”—rose 58% from 2017 to 2021.<br />The IRS has been overwhelmed for years, but the problem became acute with the 35-day partial government shutdown between December 2018 and January 2019."
