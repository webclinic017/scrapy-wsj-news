    "body": "Face it: The format of the Super Bowl party leaves something to be desired. Arrive late and you end up in the only chair with no back, someone invariably talks during the tear-jerker beer commercial you wanted to watch, and varying degrees of interest in the halftime show splits the group into shushers and shushees. The saving grace, though? The snacks. It doesn’t matter who’s winning, as long as the brown-butter blondies are nearby and the French onion dip is plentiful.<br />If you’re forgoing the raucous party this year and watching at home (no competition for snacks!), try mixing up some guacamole for two—or make a party-size batch of award-winning wings and enjoy leftovers throughout the week. No matter your plans, these recipes will have you dancing in the end zone."
