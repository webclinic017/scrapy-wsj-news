    "body": "Your editorial “Sarah Bloom Raskin’s Revolving Door” (Feb. 10) criticizes Ms. Raskin harshly for what you suggest was her improper intervention on behalf of the Reserve Trust Company to obtain a master account at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.<br />Your understanding of the facts is wrong. The decision to approve the master account was mandated by the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Banks’ Operating Circular 1 following the Kansas City Fed staff’s determination that the trust company and its business created no risk to the Federal Reserve system and, dispositively, after express confirmation by the Office of the Attorney General of Colorado and the Colorado Division of Banking that the Reserve Trust Company is authorized to accept deposits that may be federally insured."
