    "body": "Sci-fi adventures with spectacular production designs are often hailed for what’s called their world-building. The term is apt in an emotional sense for Joachim Trier’s “The Worst Person in the World,” in Norwegian with English subtitles. This vibrant, buoyant drama, intimate in scope instead of vast, takes us to Oslo—not exactly another planet, but an adventure all the same—where it builds a world of mercurial passions while its enchanting heroine, Julie (Renate Reinsve), belatedly and erratically comes of age over the course of several years. And you don’t see a single flake of snow on the screen, only the magically soft light of the city in summer, and finally fall. (The film is playing in New York and Los Angeles before expanding to other cities next week.)<br />The title is ironic, of course. Rather than the disappointment she believes herself to be, Julie has only been a rambler, a nimble drifter through the conflicting possibilities of her life. Ms. Reinsve is magnificent in the role, her radiant face a registry of unsettled feelings. It’s a great performance by any measure, and finds its complement in Anders Danielsen Lie’s beautifully nuanced portrayal of Aksel, an underground comic-book artist who is older and far more grounded than Julie, but basks in the warmth of her volatile love."
