    "body": "The leaders of two Russian-controlled areas in eastern Ukraine urged civilians to evacuate immediately to Russia on Friday as officials in Washington warned that Moscow was preparing for an invasion and looking for an excuse to start hostilities.<br />Artillery, tank and mortar exchanges increased along the cease-fire line separating the Ukrainian-controlled part of the Donbas region from Russian-held areas, according to accounts from both sides. Kyiv said it had ordered its troops to exercise restraint to avoid giving Russia a pretext to invade and denounced the evacuation announcement as a provocation."
