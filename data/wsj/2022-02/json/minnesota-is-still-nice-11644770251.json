    "body": "Lance Morrow’s “How Minnesota Went From Tom Sawyer to Huck Finn” (Cross Country, Jan. 22) and subsequent letters (Feb. 5) paint the state of Minnesota with a broad brush based on a one-sided view of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Minnesota is very large, about the size of the U.K. While events in the Twin Cities make national news, there is so much more to our state than Mr. Morrow implies.<br />Living about 80 miles southwest of the Twin Cities, I find that Mr. Morrow’s 1973 description of Minnesota is still accurate: “courtesy and fairness, honesty, a capacity for innovation, hard work, intellectual adventure, and responsibility . . . remarkably civil.”"
