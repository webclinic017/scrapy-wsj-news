    "body": "In recent years, a substantial portion of the Democratic Party has convinced itself of myths about the electorate that don’t comport with reality. That’s a prescription for defeat, with dire consequences if the Republican Party nominates Donald Trump again in 2024. His return to the Oval Office would renew the threat he poses to democracy.<br />The Democratic Party’s first duty is to protect our constitutional institutions by preventing that outcome, and every other consideration, however worthy, must yield to this overriding necessity. But the party is refusing to confront the unyielding requirements of electoral success."
