    "body": "New York Times Co.  said it surpassed its goal of 10 million subscriptions years ahead of schedule, partly thanks to its recent acquisition of sports-media company the Athletic, while profit rose sharply on the back of strong advertising-revenue growth.<br />The news organization, which had aimed to reach its subscription goal by 2025, set a new target of at least 15 million total subscribers by year-end 2027. It said it also would begin reporting the number of unique subscribers as the company focuses more on selling bundles that include multiple Times products, such as news, cooking and games. An individual who subscribes to multiple products counts as multiple subscriptions but just one unique subscriber."
