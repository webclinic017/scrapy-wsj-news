    "body": "Faith Bottum’s op-ed “What Does a Library’s ‘Diversity Auditor’ Do?” (Jan. 20) struck a chord. I had begun to witness some of this anti-intellectual pillaging in the last few years of my own academic library career, and then increasingly after I retired six years ago.<br />Instead of the normal culling of out-of-date titles in the more transient disciplines, the new goal became the elimination of significant portions of rich and painstakingly acquired works in literature, history, philosophy, etc. The principal rationale given was that such materials were out of intellectual fashion and no longer used."
