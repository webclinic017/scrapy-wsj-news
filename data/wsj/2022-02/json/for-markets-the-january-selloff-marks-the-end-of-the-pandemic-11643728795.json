    "body": "To look at stock valuations, the pandemic might never have happened.<br />On Monday, the U.S. market closed its worst month since March 2020, with the S&P 500 falling 5.3%.

The technology-heavy Nasdaq has retreated further, because the sectors that have performed worse are those more affected by higher interest rates, which the Federal Reserve has said will be a reality this year."
