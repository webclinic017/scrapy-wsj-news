    "body": "It is unclear if  Spotify Technology  is feeling any business impact from the Joe Rogan controversy so far. It is clear why the streaming platform is unlikely to pull the plug on him or any of its other podcast stars.<br />The streaming platform’s outlook that was included with its fourth-quarter results late Wednesday left the question of the controversy’s impact unanswered. Spotify’s projection of adding 3 million paid subscribers in the current quarter was 1 million shy of Wall Street’s forecasts. But it was identical to the 3 million added in last year’s first quarter, and in line with long-term trends showing the first quarter of the year to be the company’s weakest seasonal period for growth. The company’s revenue projection for the period was in line with analysts’ forecasts."
