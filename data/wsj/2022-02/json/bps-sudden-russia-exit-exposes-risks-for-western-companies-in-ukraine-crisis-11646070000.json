    "body": "BP  PLC’s abrupt unwinding of Russia ties that were 30 years in the making shows the mounting risks Western companies face doing business there—and the mess they can face getting out.<br />The British oil company said Sunday that it would divest its nearly 20% stake in Russian state oil company Rosneft, valued around $14 billion at year-end, days after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine drew an international outcry. BP earlier in the month had defended its longstanding partnership with Rosneft even as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s threats against his neighbor intensified."
