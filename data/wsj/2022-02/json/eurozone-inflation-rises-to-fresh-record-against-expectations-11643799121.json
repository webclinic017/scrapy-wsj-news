    "body": "The eurozone’s inflation rate rose to a fresh record high in January, an unwelcome surprise for policy makers at the European Central Bank who have said they don’t expect to raise their key interest rate this year.<br />As in the U.S., consumer-price inflation in the eurozone rose much more sharply in 2021 than policy makers had expected. The eurozone’s annual rate of consumer-price inflation ended 2021 at 5%, then the highest on record and more than twice the ECB’s target."
