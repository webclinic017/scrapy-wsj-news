    "body": "Despite overwhelming evidence of the benefits of vaccination, some 37% of Americans haven’t been fully vaccinated (“Protesters March Against Vaccine Mandates,” U.S. News, Jan. 24). The government should stop trying to reason with the vaccine-mandate deniers. Instead, it should set a price for their noncompliance. Life and health insurance is more expensive for people who smoke, partly to get people to modify their behavior and to ensure other policyholders don’t subsidize their bad life choices. The government should act in the same manner.<br />The federal government can “raise the cost” of opting to not be vaccinated. It could restrict hunting, fishing and boating licenses in federally controlled areas, or it could prohibit air travel or access to any government facility. When Robert F. Kennedy Jr. equates vaccine mandates with Nazi Germany, you know that reasoning is completely futile."
