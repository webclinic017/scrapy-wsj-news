    "body": "As the U.S. and Europe weigh how to respond to Russia sending troops into Ukraine, financial sanctions are prime among those measures. Over the past few months, U.S. and European countries are reported to have contemplated seeking to cut off Russian banks from the global Swift network—an extraordinary, rarely used form of financial isolation that some U.S. allies are urging.<br />The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, was founded in the 1970s to replace the telex system. It is owned by its members and overseen by central banks. Today, Swift operates in over 200 countries and connects over more than 11,000 banks, financial institutions and corporations. It doesn’t move money itself but is a vital messaging platform that banks use to order tens of millions of cross-border payments and other transactions to each other every day."
