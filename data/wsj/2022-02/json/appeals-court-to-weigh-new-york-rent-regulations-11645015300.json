    "body": "A federal appeals court on Wednesday will consider a constitutional challenge to New York stateâ€™s rent regulations, which have pitted property owners against tenant advocates.<br />Nearly three years ago the state legislature tightened the law governing roughly 1 million apartments in New York City, making it significantly more difficult for landlords to free up apartments for market rates or other uses. Landlords challenged the law in federal district court in Brooklyn almost immediately. They argued the regulations amounted to an unconstitutional government taking of private property, but a judge upheld the rules and said prior decisions by higher courts had never found any aspect of rent regulation unconstitutional."
