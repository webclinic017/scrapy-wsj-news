    "body": "It’s a good sign when  Disney ’s  stream no longer has to float the ship.<br />That stream, specifically Disney+, was one of the few bright spots in the entertainment giant’s business during the heart of the pandemic until the streaming service hit some speed bumps. A disappointing number of new subscribers for the company’s fiscal fourth quarter ended Oct. 2 came as other key businesses like theme parks were still working their way out of the pandemic’s hole. Disney’s share price slumped nearly 16% between the fourth-quarter results in early November and the latest results announced Wednesday afternoon."
