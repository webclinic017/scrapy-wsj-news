    "body": "MEXICO CITY—Workers at  General Motors Co. ’s plant in central Mexico voted for a new labor union to represent them, replacing their previous union in a first test of labor provisions under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact aimed at improving worker conditions in the country.<br />The vote is likely to unleash a wave of challenges to incumbent unions across the country, moves that could eventually improve worker wages in Mexico but lead to higher costs for companies, analysts said."
