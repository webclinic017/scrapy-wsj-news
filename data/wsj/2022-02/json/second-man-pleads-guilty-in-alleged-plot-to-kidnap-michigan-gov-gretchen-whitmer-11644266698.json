    "body": "A man charged with plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer over her response to the coronavirus pandemic entered a guilty plea Monday, the second person to plead guilty in the case set to proceed to federal court next month.<br />Kaleb James Franks pleaded guilty to kidnapping conspiracy, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, according to the plea agreement. He joins Ty Garbin, a former airplane mechanic, who was sentenced to six years and three months in federal prison last August, after pleading guilty to the same charge. Both men agreed to cooperate with the government, including testifying if called upon, according to their guilty pleas. Mr. Franks hasnâ€™t yet been sentenced."
