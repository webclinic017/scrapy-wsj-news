    "body": "I’d like to add to Sid’s Snowblower Rules that Kris Frieswick shared in her column “Homeownerous: Snow Blows” (Mansion, Jan. 28): Find the newspaper. Nothing will ruin a day of snow blowing like not being able to find where the carrier threw the paper before it jams the auger and breaks a shear pin.<br />This is even worse if shear pins have been on your hardware list since September, but you never got around to picking up spares. Nothing tests a marriage like, “You told me there wasn’t a paper,” while working to get the Journal out of the chute. Hours of prime snow-blowing time are wasted putting the blower back into operational condition."
