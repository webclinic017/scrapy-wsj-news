    "body": "Lawmakers in three states are pushing bills that would ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, as politicians across the U.S. prepare for possible changes to the abortion rights landscape.<br />The moves by GOP-led chambers in Florida, Arizona and West Virginia mirror the Mississippi law at the center of a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. The justicesâ€™ decision in that case, expected by the end of June, could upend Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark decision that established a constitutional right to end an unwanted pregnancy. That would open the door to stronger state restrictions."
