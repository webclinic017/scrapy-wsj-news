    "body": "When Yaakov Baruch, a member of majority-Muslim Indonesia’s tiny Jewish community, set out to build a Holocaust museum in his country, he wanted it to stand as a symbol against genocide and bigotry. He reached out to Yad Vashem, the main Holocaust museum in Israel, for images and other exhibition material illustrating Nazi horrors against European Jews. Late last month, on Holocaust Remembrance Day, he hosted an opening ceremony that was attended by the German ambassador to Indonesia.<br />The museum—a modest single-story structure in the lakeside town of Tondano on Indonesia’s Sulawesi island—now faces calls for its closure."
