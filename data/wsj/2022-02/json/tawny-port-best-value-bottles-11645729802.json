    "body": "WHAT IF THAT “10-year-old” tawny Port on the shelf was actually closer to seven or eight years old? Would it really matter, or is eight years old close enough?<br />Research undertaken recently by the University of Groningen Centre for Isotope Research in the Netherlands, commissioned by Dutch journalists, found by way of radiocarbon dating that some tawny Ports were not as old as their labels stated. The findings have sparked controversy: A number of companies have postponed tawny Port sales, while Port producers have questioned the research methods. I was intrigued nevertheless. It made me wonder how reliable a measure of quality age actually is."
