    "body": "The lack of depth in U.S. alpine skiing is an entrenched problem, stretching back into the 1950s (“U.S. Skiing’s $500K Problem,” Beijing 2022, Feb. 19). Since then, nearly all premier skiing athletes have had to develop via means other than support from U.S. Ski & Snowboard. Most nationally rated alpine skiers are developed in local programs, coached by volunteers or skimpily paid coaches, and provided racing opportunities through volunteer, parent-staffed groups.<br />The solution is in plain sight: Raise an endowment to increase local funding for coaches and facilities, build the competitor base, and the better talent pool generated will reduce the need to leave local areas to race."
