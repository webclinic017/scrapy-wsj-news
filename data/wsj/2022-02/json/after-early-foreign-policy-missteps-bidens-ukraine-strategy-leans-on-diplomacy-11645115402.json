    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden’s response to Russia’s military aggression along the border with Ukraine is testing whether his career-long reliance on alliance-building can help avert a potential catastrophe in Europe, and so far he has avoided the diplomatic mistakes that dogged his first year in office.<br />Mr. Biden has deployed U.S. troops to strengthen America’s defense of NATO nations and stepped up intelligence-sharing about Russia’s activities near Ukraine to keep European allies on board with his strategy of threatening severe economic sanctions on Moscow in the event of an invasion. Russia has kept in place a force estimated to be as much as 150,000, and expelled the No. 2 U.S. diplomat from Moscow. Mr. Biden said Thursday that the threat of an invasion was “very high,” though he remained hopeful that a diplomatic pathway still existed."
