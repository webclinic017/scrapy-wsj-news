    "body": "Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  has been sailing through a regulatory windstorm for more than a year now. A slowing economy and new competitive pressures are adding to already blustery conditions.<br />The impact of China’s sharp economic slowdown, particularly for consumers, is clear in the company’s latest results. Alibaba on Thursday reported its slowest growth since it went public in 2014. Revenue for the quarter ending in December grew 10% year-over-year. The growth rate for the same quarter in 2020 was 37%."
