    "body": "More travel companies are offering buy-now, pay-later deals for their flights, cruises and vacation packages. For consumers, the most important details to know are the interest rate and fine print before agreeing to the deal.<br />Buy-now, pay-later for travel is a type of layaway plan. Consumers basically take out a loan to go on their trip and then make small payments over months or even years. This allows them to go on their trips and continue to make payments after they return."
