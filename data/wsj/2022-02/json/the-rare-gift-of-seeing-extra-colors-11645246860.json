It was a compelling reminder that color isn’t “out there” in the world but within each of us. In fact, for certain rare individuals, recent research on human vision has found that the world they see is more colorful than most of us can imagine.<br />Human beings are “trichromats”—that is, the cones in our eyes are sensitive to three frequencies of light: long-wavelength reds, medium-wavelength greens and short-wavelength blues. As this trio reacts, in differing intensities and combinations, our brain compares their outputs to create the perception of color. If red and green cones are activated, we perceive yellows and oranges, whereas differing combinations of green with blue cones can make teals and turquoises, and blue with red cones might make violets and indigos."
