    "body": "The airport luxury boutique became a staple of the pre-pandemic travel boom. Now it may be heading for the departure gate.<br />In 2021, air passenger numbers globally totalled 4.6 billion, only half the 2019 level, according to data from the Airports Council International. Airlines aren’t the only ones feeling the pain. Switzerland-based  Dufry ,  one of the world’s biggest duty-free businesses, said in its latest quarterly results that sales are still down 44% compared to the same period of 2019. Based on numbers for the first nine months, London’s Heathrow Airport in 2021 was on track to make just one-quarter of the revenue from retail concessions it did two years earlier."
