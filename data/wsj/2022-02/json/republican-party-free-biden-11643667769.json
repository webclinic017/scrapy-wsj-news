    "body": "Joseph Epstein is right that the Republican Party needs a message (“What Are Republicans For?” op-ed, Jan. 26). But “to map out the true domain of government,” as Mr. Epstein quotes Roger Scruton, is a hard sell in attention-starved times. In the way that Democrats emphasize “caring,” the message needs to touch people’s most visceral hopes.<br />The Republican Party should be for opportunity: encouraging work, innovation and the rewards thereof. For confidence: America is imperfect but nevertheless great, forward-looking and ready to lead. And for solidarity: Americans are one people and prosper best when we all prosper. This core message would illuminate and guide policy details while presenting a clear contrast between the parties. The proper domain of government will follow naturally from there."
