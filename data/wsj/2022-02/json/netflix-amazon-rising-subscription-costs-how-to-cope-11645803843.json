    "body": "Inflation is everywhere. You’ve probably seen higher costs for beef, electricity and rent. Now it’s coming for your digital subscriptions too.<br />Netflix  and  Amazon  recently raised prices for new and existing customers. Netflix is currently rolling out increases for its three tiers, starting with a $1-a-month boost for the streaming service’s basic plan. (My 4K premium plan goes up by $2 to $20 a month in March.)"
