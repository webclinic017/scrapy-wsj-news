    "body": "In “What’s Really at Stake in America’s History Wars?” (Review, Feb. 12), Adam Kirsch notes the debilitating ignorance of history: “Actual historical understanding requires a much greater investment of effort and imagination than giving a thumbs-up or down to this or that name.” One might argue that to do good history is to engage in an act of ordered and empathetic imagination. To do history is to engage sources, such as documents and memories, critically, with creativity and charity. One frequent result is a lesson in humility, and compassion, neither of which would seem to dominate our public conversation.<br />Tom Jodziewicz"
