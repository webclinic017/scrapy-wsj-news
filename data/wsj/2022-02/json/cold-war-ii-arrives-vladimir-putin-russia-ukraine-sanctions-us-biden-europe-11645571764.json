    "body": "‘Who in the Lord’s name does Putin think gives him the right to declare new so-called countries?” President Biden asked Tuesday in announcing new sanctions against Russia. The answer is a complacent West, which has failed to impose serious costs despite more than a decade of Russian aggression.<br />At least the Administration overcame its initial reluctance to call Vladimir Putin’s deployment of troops in Eastern Ukraine an “invasion.” Mr. Biden on Tuesday called it “the beginning of a Russian invasion,” and he responded with what he said was the beginning of greater sanctions."
