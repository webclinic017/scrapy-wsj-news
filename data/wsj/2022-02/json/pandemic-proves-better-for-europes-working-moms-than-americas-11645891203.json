    "body": "LONDON—While Covid-19 restrictions prompted an exodus of mothers from the U.S. labor force, working moms in the U.K. and some other parts of Europe have found new working arrangements to their liking, generating a bright spot in employment patterns that could persist beyond the pandemic.<br />Many mothers in the U.S. fell out of work as schools and businesses closed, but in the U.K. the proportion of working mothers increased. More widely, women in Northern and Western Europe were less likely to leave the labor force than men during the pandemic—the reverse of the situation in the U.S."
