    "body": "Amazon.com Inc.  and  Visa Inc.  reached an agreement allowing customers to use Visa credit cards across the online retailer’s websites and shops, the companies said, resolving a monthslong dispute.<br />Amazon in November told customers it would stop accepting Visa credit cards issued in the U.K. starting in January because of the card network’s high fees. Last month, Amazon said it would allow customers to keep using their cards past that date while it negotiated an agreement with Visa."
