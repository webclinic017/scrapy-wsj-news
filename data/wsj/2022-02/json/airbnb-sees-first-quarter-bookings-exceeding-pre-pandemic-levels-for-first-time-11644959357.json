    "body": "Airbnb Inc.  posted record revenue last year, becoming one of the biggest beneficiaries of a battered travel industry as consumers sought suburban rentals, and projected continued growth as it emerges from the pandemic.<br />The San Francisco-based home-rental giant said it expects the number of nights and so-called experiences booked in the current quarter that ends March 31 to exceed pre-pandemic levels for the first time since the health crisis struck. If Airbnb’s first-quarter forecast holds up, it would mark a record number of quarterly nights and experiences booked for the company."
