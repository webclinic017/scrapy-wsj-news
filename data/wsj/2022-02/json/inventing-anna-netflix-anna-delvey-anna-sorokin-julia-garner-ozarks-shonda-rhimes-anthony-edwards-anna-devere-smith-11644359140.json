    "body": "The “hate watch” as a programming calculation reaches an apotheosis with “Inventing Anna,” which makes its perverse intentions clear from the opening voiceover: “This whole show—the one you’re about to sit on your fat ass and watch like a big lump of nothing—is about me.” OK, then: Let’s settle our collective posterior on the couch.<br />It fits. The attitude, that is: The “me” above is Anna Delvey, aka Anna Sorokin (Julia Garner), the counterfeit German heiress and reputed trust-fund baby about whom viewers have probably heard plenty, and maybe too much: When she was arrested in 2017 for defrauding banks, hotels, moneyed acquaintances and struggling friends, she became something of a tabloid folk heroine, a petite, couture-wearing, convoluted Robin Hood: She stole from the rich and gave to herself (though she did tip lavishly)."
