    "body": "Adulthood is a good look for Google, but that doesn’t mean its life will get much easier.<br />The search giant owned by  Alphabet Inc.  closed a banner year with its fourth-quarter results posted late Tuesday. Advertising revenue jumped 33% year over year to $61.2 billion—beating Wall Street’s consensus forecast by 4%. That was mostly on the strength of the classic search business; YouTube advertising grew 25% but fell a bit short of analysts’ targets. The strong close gave the parent company its best year of revenue growth since 2007, with operating margins for the year closing above 30% for the first time since 2012. Alphabet’s share price jumped nearly 9% after hours following the earnings report."
