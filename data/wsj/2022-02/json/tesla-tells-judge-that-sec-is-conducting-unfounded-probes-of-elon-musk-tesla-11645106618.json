    "body": "Tesla Inc.  says regulators are harassing Chief Executive Elon Musk over his compliance with a 2018 regulatory settlement that sought to restrict his use of social media.<br />The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting unfounded investigations of Mr. Musk and Tesla, attorneys for the company say in a letter filed Thursday with a federal judge who oversaw the settlement. Tesla disclosed earlier this month that regulators sent a subpoena last year that sought information showing how the company and its CEO complied with the terms of the deal."
