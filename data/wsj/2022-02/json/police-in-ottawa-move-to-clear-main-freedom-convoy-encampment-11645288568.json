    "body": "OTTAWA—Police on Saturday pushed into a central encampment of protesters whose vehicles have paralyzed the capital’s downtown for more than three weeks, in an effort to clear those who remained entrenched in the area after another police advance led to more than 100 arrests Friday.<br />The protracted demonstration against Covid-19 vaccine mandates on the streets of downtown Ottawa, which also inspired blockades at some U.S.- Canada border crossings, is now being met with hundreds of police officers drawn from across the country, including some on horseback and others who carried batons and shields. Some officers were carrying firearms."
