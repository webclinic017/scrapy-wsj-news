    "body": "ST. PAUL, Minn.—A federal jury found three former Minneapolis police officers guilty of violating George Floyd’s civil rights, ending another chapter in a 2020 case that launched a summer of unrest and a national discussion over race and policing.<br />Former officers Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane were convicted of showing deliberate indifference to Mr. Floyd’s serious medical need as he lay handcuffed and face down in the street with former officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on his neck and back for more than nine minutes. Mr. Thao and Mr. Kueng were also convicted with willfully failing to intervene to stop Mr. Chauvin from using unreasonable force."
