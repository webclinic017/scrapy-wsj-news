    "body": "The White House is apparently experiencing buyer’s remorse over its appointment of Xavier Becerra to run the Health and Human Services Department. This is the cost of indulging identity politics in a pandemic.<br />According to a cast of anonymous dozens in a Washington Post story, the Biden Administration is “frustrated” with Mr. Becerra’s failure to “coordinat[e] the nation’s vast health bureaucracy” to handle the virus, allowing “confusing and sometimes conflicting messages.” The HHS chief is accused of being in over his head and, according to one unnamed senior Administration official, “taking too passive a role” in virus management."
