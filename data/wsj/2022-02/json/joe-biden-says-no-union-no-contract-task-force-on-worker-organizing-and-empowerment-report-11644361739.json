    "body": "Joe Biden promised to be “the most pro-union President you’ve ever seen” before he took office, and he’s spent a year struggling to show it. Now he’s announced a new pro-union agenda, including plans to skirt the law by steering federal funds toward Big Labor.<br />On Monday the White House released recommendations from its Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment. The body, led by Vice President Kamala Harris and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, was formed last April to “advance worker organizing and collective bargaining” among public and private employers. Its first report includes nearly 70 proposed policy changes."
