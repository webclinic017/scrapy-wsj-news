    "body": "HONG KONG—As spiraling Omicron cases overwhelm Hong Kong’s health system, officials doubled down on their zero-Covid strategy on Tuesday by commandeering thousands of apartments and hotel rooms to isolate infected residents.<br />Wards at public hospitals have begun to overflow, with reports of children being turned away as pediatric isolation beds ran out. Despite the strain, just a fraction of those being treated or isolated were in critical condition, and Hong Kong officials urged Covid-19-positive residents—previously subject to immediate hospitalization regardless of symptoms or vaccination status—to avoid emergency rooms if their symptoms are mild."
