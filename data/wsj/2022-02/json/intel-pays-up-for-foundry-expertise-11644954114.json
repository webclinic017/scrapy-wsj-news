    "body": "For anyone doubting  Intel Corp.’s  ambitions to make chips for others, the company’s acquisition of  Tower Semiconductor  should lay their doubts to rest.<br />The deal reported by The Wall Street Journal late Monday and announced by the two companies Tuesday carries an enterprise value of $5.4 billion and thus ranks as Intel’s fourth largest deal ever, behind the acquisitions of Altera, Mobileye and  McAfee .  But it exceeds the first two in terms of premium paid; the $53 a share in cash offered for Tower is 60% above the stock’s last closing price, compared with the 34% premium offered for Mobileye in 2017."
