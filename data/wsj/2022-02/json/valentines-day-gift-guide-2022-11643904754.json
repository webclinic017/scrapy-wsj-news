Some even enjoy being exposed to the elements for hours, embarking on frigid afternoon hikes or extremely brisk but nonetheless romantic after-dinner walks in the snow. This year, give someone you care about the gift of nature, whether it’s a pair of surprisingly chic boots to brave a slippery trail or—for those who appreciate houseplants but have inadvertently murdered every orchid that ever graced their home—some painted metal flowers. Here, 11 Valentine’s Day gifts for anyone who loves nature, or at least the idea of it.<br />If your Valentine struggles to keep even succulents alive, swap roses for painted metal flowers. Chicer than tacky fabric buds, they just might outlast your relationship. $150, GetTheGusto.com"
