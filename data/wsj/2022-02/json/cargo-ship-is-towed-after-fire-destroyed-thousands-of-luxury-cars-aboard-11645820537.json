    "body": "BERLIN—Salvage crews boarded the Felicity Ace merchant ship that caught fire with a cargo of luxury  Porsche ,  Bentley, Lamborghini, Audi and  Volkswagen  vehicles, and began towing the vessel to safety, the operator of the ship said Friday.<br />The 60,000-ton Panama-flagged ship carrying about 4,000 of the world’s most-expensive car models, including electric vehicles, caught fire off Portugal’s Azores islands last week and burned intensely for days. Tugboats with water cannons sprayed the ship’s exterior to cool it down and weaken the blaze. The 22-member crew was rescued without injury after abandoning the burning ship."
