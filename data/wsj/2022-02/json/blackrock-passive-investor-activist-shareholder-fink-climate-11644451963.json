    "body": "Why should Larry Fink & Co. have the right to vote the shares held by investors in their funds and ETFs? (“BlackRock’s Climate-Crusade Doubletalk” by Vivek Ramaswamy, op-ed, Feb. 7). Last year we sold all of our BlackRock holdings, but the problem exists with funds and ETFs in general.<br />The rules should change so that we, as fund shareholders, are either allowed to vote our own shares in any company held by the ETF or fund, or abstain by default. Currently, the default is for Mr. Fink to vote for the shareholders. How many investors who hold individual company shares in an investment account would want their stockbroker voting their shares?"
