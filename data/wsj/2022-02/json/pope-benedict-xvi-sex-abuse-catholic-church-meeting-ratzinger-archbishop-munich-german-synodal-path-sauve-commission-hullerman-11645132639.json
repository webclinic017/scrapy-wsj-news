    "body": "Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI has come under criticism for his handling of sexual abuse cases as an archbishop more than 40 years ago. His lawyers contested the inquiry’s charges, and the discussion of whether he did enough to stop sexual predators in the Archdiocese of Munich-Freising will continue. The matter is crucial not only to the legacy of Pope Benedict XVI but to the future of the Catholic Church.<br />Intense internal debate has been common throughout the church’s 2,000-year history. But the conflict over sexual abuse is not simply about rooting out a great evil; it also has become a central feature of a more longstanding conversation about the church’s prospects. Any conversation about then-Archbishop Ratzinger’s alleged negligence must be considered with this in mind."
