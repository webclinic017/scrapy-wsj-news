    "body": "PARIS—When President Emmanuel Macron of France meets Russia’s Vladimir Putin on Monday he will embark on a round of shuttle diplomacy aimed at defusing the Ukraine crisis and opening an era for European countries to play a bigger role in the continent’s defense.<br />The gambit comes as relations between Russia and the West are on a knife’s edge. Mr. Putin has massed more than 100,000 troops along the border with Ukraine in what Western officials fear is a prelude to an invasion that could be Europe’s biggest land war since World War II. His demand: that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization scale back its military presence in Eastern Europe to that of 1997, before most of the former Eastern Bloc countries had joined the alliance."
