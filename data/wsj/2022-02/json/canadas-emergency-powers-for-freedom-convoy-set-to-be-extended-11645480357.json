    "body": "OTTAWA—Canada on Monday was set to extend the use of the special emergency powers invoked last week by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to quell protests against Covid-19 mandates, which had paralyzed the capital and disrupted cross-border trade.<br />The Canadian legislature on Monday evening will vote to approve a cabinet order that invoked powers available under the country’s Emergencies Act for a full 30-day period. The order authorizes police to designate certain areas—including the streets around Ottawa’s Parliament Hill—as no-protest zones where people could be subject to arrest, and to compel service providers like tow-truck operators to remove vehicles from the scene. The powers also took aim at protesters’ financial assets and sources of cash."
