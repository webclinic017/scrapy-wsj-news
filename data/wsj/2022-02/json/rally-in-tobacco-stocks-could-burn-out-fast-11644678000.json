    "body": "Tobacco stocks are fashionable again, but investors’ taste for nicotine may not last.<br />In this year’s rocky markets, the U.S.-listed shares of cigarette producers  Philip Morris International  and  Altria  have risen 14% and 6%, respectively, making tobacco the fourth biggest gainer among the S&P 500 index’s more than 60 subsectors. London-listed Lucky Strike owner  British American Tobacco  has fared even better, up more than a fifth."
