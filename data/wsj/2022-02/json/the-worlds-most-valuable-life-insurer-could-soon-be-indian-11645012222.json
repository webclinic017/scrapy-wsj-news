    "body": "Enthusiasm for shares of India’s new, recently listed technology companies is fizzling out. An old state-owned insurance behemoth is trying to position itself as a more sturdy offering in its coming record listing.<br />The initial public offering of the 65-year-old Life Insurance Corporation of India, or LIC, could raise around $8 billion, making it by far the country’s largest listing to date. The previous record was set only last year by the $2.5 billion IPO of  One97 Communications ,  which owns mobile-payments company Paytm. LIC’s listing would also be the world’s second-largest IPO this year so far, according to Dealogic. The state-owned insurer, which used to be a monopoly, still has nearly two-thirds of the life-insurance market, with around 280 million individual policies in force."
