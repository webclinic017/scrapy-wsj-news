    "body": "Most Western media coverage of Near Eastern Christians focuses on their persecution, and their plight deserves to be better known. But Christians in the Near East are more than an oppressed people. They belong to unique national communities rooted in a premodern, pre-Islamic landscape, suffused with the Semitic culture of the early church. As Western culture turns against itself, the endangered faithful might help us more than we can help them.<br />Indigenous to modern Iraq, the Assyrian Church of the East is the easternmost branch of apostolic Christianity—conservator of the world’s oldest eucharistic liturgy and guardian of the Aramaic language of Christ. This “Nestorian Church” was separated from Western Christianity in 431 at the Council of Ephesus, after bishops in Assyria and Babylonia broke with the imperial church over the nature of Jesus and Mary. The church is woefully forgotten today, often thought to be a branch of Catholicism or Orthodoxy. Yet in its heyday it was larger than the Latin and Greek churches and stretched deep into Central Asia, China and India."
