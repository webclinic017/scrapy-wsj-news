    "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin’s order to send troops into two breakaway regions of Ukraine has sent relations between Moscow and the West spinning to their lowest point since the Cold War. The incursion is an integral part of his broader strategy to redraw the security map set with the collapse of the Soviet Union more than 30 years ago and split the U.S. from its European partners, many of which rely heavily on Russia’s rich energy reserves.<br />It is an unprecedented gamble for Mr. Putin, who is now reckoning with a plethora of new economic sanctions from the U.S. and Europe aimed at hamstringing his country’s economy."
