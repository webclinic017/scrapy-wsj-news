    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration said Friday it would extend a set of tariffs on solar-energy imports for four years, but significantly reduce their scope by doubling the amount of solar cells that can enter the U.S. without facing any levies.<br />The tariffs apply to imports of solar cells and modules globally. About two-thirds of the familiar solar modules that go on rooftops and utility installations are made in China, and about 15% are manufactured by countries in Southeast Asia, often at Chinese-owned companies, according to the data from  IHS Markit .  U.S. producers make about 2%."
