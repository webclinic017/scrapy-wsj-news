    "body": "Shell  Chairman Andrew Mackenzie promised in December that unifying its corporate identity in the U.K. would “allow for an acceleration in shareholder distributions and speed up Shell’s transition to a net-zero emissions energy business.” Within a week of becoming fully British, the company has given financial investors what they were promised, but any green-focused investors aren’t yet so fortunate.<br />The energy giant on Thursday reported a tremendously profitable year, generating $19 billion in adjusted earnings and $45 billion in cash flow from its operations. Returns were buoyed by higher oil and gas prices in a tight market. The company said it would increase its dividend and buy back $8.5 billion of its shares by the summer, boosted partly by the sale of its assets in the Permian basin. The stock rose modestly in early European trading."
