    "body": "In “Google’s ‘Inclusive Language’ Police” (op-ed, Jan. 21), Lawrence Krauss writes, “I have a hard time understanding how people can be so hurt by the use of some words and names.” I wonder how much time he has spent seeking out background information and trying to understand? Let’s get some things straight.<br />First, language has small and large impacts day to day. Language reflects the world around us and influences how we feel and think. Take “illegal alien”: This term brands a person “illegal” and implies they’re not human but “alien.” Beyond dehumanizing, the term is imprecise: It implies criminality, but lacking immigration documents is a civil, not criminal, offense. In Rwanda, some Hutus referred to Tutsis as “cockroaches” on popular radio stations. The intentional repetition of dehumanizing terms turned many Hutus against Tutsi neighbors, resulting in the 1994 genocide."
