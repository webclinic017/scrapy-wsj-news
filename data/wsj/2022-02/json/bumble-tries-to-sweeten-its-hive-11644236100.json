Bumble says Fruitz is one of the fastest-growing dating apps in Europe across countries like France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, and it is available in Canada. The app, especially popular with Gen Z, enables users to metaphorically set their dating intentions by selecting one of four fruits symbolizing things like looking for a serious relationship or for a friend with benefits."
