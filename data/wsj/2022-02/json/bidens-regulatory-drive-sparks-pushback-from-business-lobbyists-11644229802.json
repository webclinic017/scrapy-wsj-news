    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is preparing a wave of new regulations as it embarks on its second year, sparking resistance campaigns from business lobbyists representing financial services, agribusiness, medical-device makers and others.<br />Lobbyists and business groups are responding to what some describe as the federal government’s most concerted regulatory push since the Obama administration. Some Democrats hope the regulatory effort will deliver some policy wins for progressives and union activists ahead of November’s midterm elections, especially now that President Biden’s congressional agenda has stalled amid infighting within the Democratic Party."
