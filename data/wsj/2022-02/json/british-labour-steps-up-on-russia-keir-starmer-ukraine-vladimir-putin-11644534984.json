    "body": "Not all of Europe wants to appease Vladimir Putin as his troops threaten Ukraine. And not even all of the European left. Full marks to Keir Starmer, the British opposition leader, who on Thursday came out four-square in support of reinforcing NATO and helping Kyiv.<br />“Nobody wants war. At first glance some on the left may be sympathetic to those siren voices who condemn Nato,” the Labour party leader wrote in the left-wing Guardian. “But to condemn Nato is to condemn the guarantee of democracy and security it brings, and which our allies in eastern and central Europe are relying on, as the sabre-rattling from Moscow grows ever louder.”"
