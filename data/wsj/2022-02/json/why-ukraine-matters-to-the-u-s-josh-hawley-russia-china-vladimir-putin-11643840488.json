    "body": "The Biden Administration announced Wednesday that it will soon deploy thousands of U.S. troops to shore up NATO’s eastern flank. It’s the right decision with more than 100,000 Russian troops along Ukraine’s borders.<br />A Pentagon spokesman said Wednesday that some 1,000 American troops based in Germany will soon shift to Romania and about 2,000 will leave the U.S. for Poland and Germany. “These are not permanent moves,” a Pentagon spokesman stressed Wednesday. “These forces are not going to fight in Ukraine.”"
