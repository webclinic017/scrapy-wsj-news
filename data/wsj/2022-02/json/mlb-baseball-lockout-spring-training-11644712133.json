    "body": "Major League Baseball’s spring training won’t start next week as scheduled after a meeting Saturday between team owners and the players’ union to resolve the sport’s ongoing labor dispute resulted in little progress.<br />Management imposed a lockout of players following the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement on Dec. 2, and the sides remain nowhere close to reaching a new deal more than two months later. The standoff has raised the threat of what commissioner Rob Manfred recently called “a disastrous outcome”: missing regular-season games because of a work stoppage for the first time since the strike of 1994 that led to the cancellation of the World Series."
