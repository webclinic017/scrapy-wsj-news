    "body": "Just when you think you’ve seen the most embarrassing bit of television punditry, another guru says “hold my beer.” The common thread lately has been to make pandemic video-calling star Zoom Video Communications Inc. look bad.<br />Back in October, stock trader Mark Minervini, who charges $999 a month for his “Private Access” service, was touting a company he had recommended on CNBC, Upstart Holdings Inc., when host Tyler Mathisen asked him what the company did. The suddenly tongue-tied guest then claimed that he couldn’t hear the question, cutting the interview short. Roasted on social media, Mr. Minervini tweeted, “Sorry... they lost my audio right at the middle of the segment. Short $ZM... LOL!”"
