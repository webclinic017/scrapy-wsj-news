    "body": "A federal appeals court on Tuesday takes up a closely watched case about transgender rights, considering whether a Florida school district discriminated against a transgender boy by prohibiting him from using the men’s bathrooms at his high school.<br />The case, before the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, is the latest to examine a hot-button issue that remains somewhat unsettled. Several lower courts have issued prominent rulings in favor of transgender students, but the 11th Circuit has signaled it is considering whether to rule the other way. Seven of the court’s 11 active judges were appointed by Republican presidents, including six by former President Donald Trump."
