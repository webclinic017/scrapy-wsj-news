    "body": "The 2022 Winter Olympics will be remembered for geopolitics, not sports. It’s where Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin declared war on the post-Cold War world order and the American primacy that sustained it. Issuing a joint statement that criticized the U.S. by name six times and outlined an ambitious program of anti-Western collaboration from Ukraine to the South China Sea, the two leaders left no doubt that the world’s holiday from history has come to an end.<br />The world has changed, and American policy must change with it. The longer the U.S. waits to build a national defense adequate to the challenges it faces, the greater the danger and expense ultimately will be."
