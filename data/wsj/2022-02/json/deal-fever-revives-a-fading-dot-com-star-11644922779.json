    "body": "As investors cool on big tech, they are warming to some faded stars of the dot-com era: telecommunications companies such as London-listed  Vodafone .  The bet has legs, particularly if European politicians decide that 5G networks are a higher priority than discount phone packages.<br />Telecommunications stocks have been among the rare gainers this year. The global sector has risen 3%, against a 6% decline in the wider MSCI World Index. Rising rates mechanically improve the appeal of dividend-paying companies relative to those that promise growth, but there are specific factors at play too, particularly in Europe. Vodafone is up 20% on news of investor activism and potential deals."
