    "body": "Businesses are getting whipsawed by the Biden Administration regulatory juggernaut, but here’s a rule-making they can cheer: The Department of Homeland Security is exercising its discretionary authority to issue 20,000 more H-2B visas for seasonal workers in the coming months.<br />The Immigration and Nationality Act caps H-2B visas at 66,000 each fiscal year, split evenly between the first and second halves. But DHS may issue additional visas if it determines, after consulting the Labor Department, that employers can’t fill seasonal positions with willing, qualified American workers."
