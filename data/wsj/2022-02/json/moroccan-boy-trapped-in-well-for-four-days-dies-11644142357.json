    "body": "A young boy trapped for four days in a well in northern Morocco has died, according to the country’s royal palace, after a frantic rescue effort that captured world-wide attention.<br />Rescuers reached the five-year-old child, identified as Rayan Aourram, on Saturday night after excavating and tunneling into the well, but he did not survive. He was pulled out wrapped in a yellow blanket and taken by helicopter to a hospital before Morocco’s monarch confirmed his death."
