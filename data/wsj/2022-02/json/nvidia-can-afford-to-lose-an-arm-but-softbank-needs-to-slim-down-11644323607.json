    "body": "Brawny chip company Nvidia can afford to lose Arm. Keeping the high-tech appendage fully attached a while longer may prove a headache for SoftBank.<br />The derailment of graphics-chip company Nvidia’s planned purchase of chip designer Arm from SoftBank isn’t exactly a surprise. The transaction—which would have been the largest-ever deal in the semiconductor industry—was fighting an uphill battle since the beginning because of antitrust concerns. Arm’s chip-design architecture powers almost every mobile device on the planet, and the company counts many of Nvidia’s rivals among its customers. The cash-and-stock deal was valued at around $40 billion at its unveiling and would have been valued  at more than $60 billion at current prices as Nvidia’s shares have doubled since then."
