    "body": "Tuesday night’s State of the Union address arrives with Joe Biden’s approval rating in the dumps at about 42%. Chaos continues. There’s pain in Ukraine. Inflation rages. “I did that” stickers with Mr. Biden pointing at high prices are showing up on gasoline pumps across the country.<br />But with so many issues most Americans roll their eyes—sanctions, antitrust, climate, zzzz. Out of sight, out of mind. For 79-year-old Joe Biden’s political survival, he needs a new slogan: “Out with the old, in with the bold.” He should forget the Beltway babble and pivot hard to do something right in front of our faces."
