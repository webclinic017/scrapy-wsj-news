    "body": "The members of the Sackler family who own Purdue Pharma LP have agreed to contribute as much as $6 billion to settle litigation accusing them of fueling opioid addiction, a new attempt to resolve civil liability and get the drugmaker out of bankruptcy after a previous chapter 11 deal was overturned.<br />The revised offer marks an increase from the $4.5 billion settlement the Sacklers had previously agreed to under a bankruptcy plan for Purdue, the OxyContin manufacturer closely associated with the opioid epidemic. A federal judge rejected that settlement proposal in December, ruling in favor of the handful of state attorneys general who didn’t accept the Sacklers’ offer."
