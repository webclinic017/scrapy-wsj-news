    "body": "California’s Gov. Gavin Newsom declared in February that the no-longer-novel coronavirus is “endemic” and said: “We are moving past the crisis phase into a phase where we will work to live with this virus.” So why hasn’t he ended California’s state of emergency?<br />California isn’t alone. Democratic governors across the country, and a few Republicans as well, are maintaining emergency declarations that grant them sweeping power to suspend state laws and limit liberty if they deem it necessary to protect public health."
