    "body": "A device based at a U.K. facility in Oxfordshire has produced the highest sustained nuclear-fusion energy ever recorded, European researchers said Wednesday.<br />The results of the December 2021 experiment, which generated 59 megajoules of fusion energy for five seconds, “demonstrates we are on the correct path” with regards to nuclear fusion, said Rafael Juárez Mañas, an engineering professor at the National Distance Education University in Madrid who wasn’t involved in the research."
