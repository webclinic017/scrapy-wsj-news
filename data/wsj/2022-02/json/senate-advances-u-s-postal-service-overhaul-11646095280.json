    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The Senate easily cleared a procedural hurdle for legislation intended to put the U.S. Postal Service on a stronger financial foundation, completing a step that could lead to passage of the measure within a week.<br />The 74-20 procedural vote came weeks after the House passed identical legislation. The bill would require postal retirees to enroll in Medicare starting in 2025 and would void a provision in a 2006 law that required the postal service to prefund its retiree health benefits. The two measures were central to a 10-year plan approved by the postal service leadership, including Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, aimed at improving the financial position of the cash-strapped agency."
