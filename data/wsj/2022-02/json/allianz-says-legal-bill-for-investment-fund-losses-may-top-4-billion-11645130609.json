    "body": "Allianz  SE set aside more than $4 billion for legal expenses stemming from losses its investment funds racked up during the March 2020 market panic when their options trades went bad.<br />The German financial giant said Thursday it accounted for the 3.7 billion euros in legal provisions, equivalent to $4.2 billion, in its 2021 results. As a result, Allianz’s net income fell 2.6% to €6.6 billion. The fund losses have drawn probes from the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission as well as several lawsuits from the funds’ investors."
