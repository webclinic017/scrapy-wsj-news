    "body": "Trial proceedings wrapped up Friday in former Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palinâ€™s defamation lawsuit against the New York Times, with a jury set to decide one of the biggest media-law battles in years.<br />In closing arguments, lawyers for Ms. Palin sought to portray the Times as a newspaper that used its power to disfavor conservatives, while the Times said the former Alaska governor was attempting to seize on a mistake it made in order to undermine important legal protections for a free press."
