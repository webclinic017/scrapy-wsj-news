    "body": "U.S. inflation is estimated to have remained at a nearly four-decade high in January as prices remained under pressure from strong consumer demand and pandemic-related supply constraints.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect the Labor Department will report the consumer-price index—which measures what consumers pay for goods and services—rose 7.2% in January from the same month a year ago, marking a pickup from a 7% annual rate in December. It also would be the fastest pace for inflation since February 1982 and the eighth straight month above 5%."
