And the country becomes a prison: Witness the consequences Ms. Kabaş now faces because her remark was interpreted as insulting President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.<br />Police arrested Ms. Kabaş in late January, and the Turkish press reports that she faces up to 11 years in prison for criticizing Mr. Erdoğan and two senior officials. “It is no one’s place to insult our President, who has been doing great service to this country for years, under the name of freedom of expression,” tweetedFahrettin Altun, Mr. Erdoğan’s communications director."
