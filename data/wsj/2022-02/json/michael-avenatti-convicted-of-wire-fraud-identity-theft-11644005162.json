    "body": "Disgraced celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti was convicted Friday of stealing nearly $300,000 from his former client and onetime ally, the adult-film actress Stormy Daniels.<br />A Manhattan federal jury found Mr. Avenatti, 50 years old, guilty of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. The verdict caps a trial in which Mr. Avenatti unexpectedly benched his lawyers and began representing himself, questioned Ms. Daniels on the witness stand and then declined to present any defense witnesses."
