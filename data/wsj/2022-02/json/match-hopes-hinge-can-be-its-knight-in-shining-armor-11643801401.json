    "body": "Dating giant  Match Group  is finally showing a little more skin, lest investors start to lose interest. The question is whether their heads have already turned.<br />The dating giant reported mixed fourth-quarter results on Tuesday with adjusted operating income (previously earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) coming in just above Wall Street’s estimate, while both Tinder revenue and total revenue growth fell slightly short of analysts’ expectations. Match attributed the revenue shortfall to foreign exchange and lingering effects of Omicron, but fickle investors still sent shares down more than 5% after hours immediately following the report."
