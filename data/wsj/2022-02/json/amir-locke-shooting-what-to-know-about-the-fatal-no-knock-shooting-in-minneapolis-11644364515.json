    "body": "Amir Locke, a 22-year-old Black man, was killed on the morning of Feb. 2 when Minneapolis police were executing a no-knock warrant connected to a murder investigation in St. Paul.<br />The fatal shooting has sparked large, peaceful protests by those upset by the latest killing of a young, Black person by police in the Twin Cities area and calls for the resignation of the interim Minneapolis police chief. It has also invited parallels to the killing of Breonna Taylor by police in Louisville, Ky., during a similar no-knock raid in March 2020."
