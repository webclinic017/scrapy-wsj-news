    "body": "UBS  wants to push deeper into the U.S. European banks have a checkered history of trying to crack the American market, but the Swiss wealth manager is better set up for the challenge than most.<br />The company outlined its new strategy on Tuesday alongside better-than-expected full-year results. Strong cash generation enabled a dividend of 50 cents a share—costing roughly $1.7 billion in total—and projected buybacks of $5 billion this year. The only real blemish is a continuing French tax case, against which UBS increased its provision to €1.1 billion despite appealing the latest decision."
