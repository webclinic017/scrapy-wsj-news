    "body": "San Francisco experienced a moderate earthquake Tuesday as liberal Democrats revolted against woke, coercive progressivism and overwhelmingly recalled three school board members. The political seismic waves are rippling across the country, potentially signaling a bigger quake in November.<br />The school board recall was a landslide, with Alison Collins (79%), Gabriela Lopez (75%) and Faauuga Moliga (72%) getting soundly defeated. Successful recalls are rare, and it takes real effort to lose by 3 to 1 or 4 to 1. San Francisco Board of Supervisors President Shamann Walton dismissed the recall as driven by “closet Republicans and most certainly folks with conservative values in San Francisco, even if they weren’t registered Republicans.”"
