    "body": "British energy giant  BP  PLC said Sunday it will exit its nearly 20% stake in Russian government-controlled oil producer  Rosneft ,  days after it was pressured to unload the holding by U.K. officials amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.<br />The British company faces a potential loss of as much as $25 billion—encompassing the maximum possible impact of selling the Rosneft stake, valued at $14 billion, plus a big expected charge related to foreign-exchange losses. Currently, BP relies on Rosneft for roughly one-third of its oil-and-gas production."
