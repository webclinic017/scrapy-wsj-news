    "body": "Peggy Noonan’s column (“Republicans, Stand Against Excess,” Declarations, Feb. 12) reliably contains strong doses of heartfelt wisdom and strategic acumen, but it also suggests that the core value of the GOP ought to be moderation. The party should “stand against excess on all fronts,” she says.<br />The moderate course is often the best one, but on occasion it is morally necessary to take a firmer stand. No one believes in a moderate degree of racism, nor in moderately abusing children. Some of the cultural developments we confront today go well beyond what Ms. Noonan calls “rejiggering.” They affect the core of personal identity and our most basic commitments."
