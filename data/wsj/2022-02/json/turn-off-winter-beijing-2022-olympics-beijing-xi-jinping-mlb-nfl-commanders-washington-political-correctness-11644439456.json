    "body": "Needless to say, I won’t be watching the Winter Olympics in China, where it’s winter every day for the human spirit. Best of luck to our athletes, who are sentenced to performing in whichever country the endlessly disagreeable International Olympic Committee chooses. The IOC’s Plan B choice for the Winter Olympics was Kazakhstan, last seen inviting in Vladimir Putin’s army to crush antigovernment protests.<br />But even from the moral comfort of a couch, Xi Jinping’s internal repression, external hacking of foreign reporters, absorption of Hong Kong and antidemocratic compact with Mr. Putin—struck on the eve of the Opening Ceremonies—makes the Beijing Olympics a bit too redolent of the Munich Games in 1936 to merit this viewer’s tube time."
