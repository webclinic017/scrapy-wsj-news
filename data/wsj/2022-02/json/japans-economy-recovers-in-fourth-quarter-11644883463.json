    "body": "TOKYO—Japan’s economy returned to growth in the October-December quarter thanks to higher consumer spending, but a resurgence in Covid-19 infections is likely to hold back the recovery in the current quarter.<br />In the final quarter of 2021, the world’s third-largest economy after the U.S. and China grew 1.3% from the previous quarter. That was equal to 5.4% on an annualized basis, showing what would happen if the quarter’s growth continued for a full year."
