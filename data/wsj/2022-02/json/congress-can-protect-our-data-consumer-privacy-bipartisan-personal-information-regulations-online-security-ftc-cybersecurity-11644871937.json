    "body": "Although a surprisingly wide range of consumer organizations and business groups are urging lawmakers to act, Congress has shown itself unable to move forward with consumer-privacy legislation. Unless it does so, the Federal Trade Commission and the states may end up using other tools to give Americans more control over personal information.<br />When I chaired the FTC, I would not have supported such action. Soon, I may. State and agency efforts cannot be as comprehensive as a national law and, depending on how they are written, may raise constitutional concerns. Still, a patchwork of consumer-privacy statutes and regulations is better than none at all."
