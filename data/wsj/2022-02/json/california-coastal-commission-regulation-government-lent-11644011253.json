    "body": "In “Two Supreme Court Cases to Watch” (Review & Outlook, Jan. 26), the Journal discusses abuses by the administrative state. My own case, Lent v. the California Coastal Commission, recently submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court, illustrates how dangerous these abuses can be.<br />After my wife and I purchased a beachfront property in the California coastal zone, we found ourselves targeted by the CCC. The house had an easement on five feet of private property for a potential, but never developed, beach access. A safety gate and staircase, built over 20 years prior to our ownership, intruded into the easement. For our alleged “crime” of failing to remove these structures, which we argue were legally built, we were brought before a perfunctory hearing of the CCC. At that hearing we were denied due process and received a $4.2 million fine, more than the entire equity in the home. This would destroy a lifetime of work."
