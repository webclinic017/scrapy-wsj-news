    "body": "Lisa Cook shouldn’t be confirmed for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board. Her career is impressive: economics doctorate from Berkeley, professor at Michigan State, National Bureau of Economic Research associate. But her nomination is part of a broader agenda by leftist Democrats. They seek to move the Fed away from its “dual mandate” of maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates and toward an ideological agenda.<br />I applaud that senators have emphasized the benefit of a doctorate in economics and a career in academia or the Fed for serving as governor. We need excellent economists on the board, with expertise in fields such as monetary economics, macroeconomics, financial economics and financial regulation. There are many worthy candidates."
