    "body": "Speculate for yourself whether the private antics of high-ranking CNNers, which recently led to the departure of longtime network chief Jeff Zucker, are separate and apart from how CNN conducts its business. The near-universal verdict for a while has been that CNN puts out a shoddy product compared with its founding ethos as a straight-shooting 24-hour news service.<br />Think back to its botched coverage of an alleged racist incident on the Washington Mall in 2019 involving Kentucky high schoolers. The Atlantic’s Caitlin Flanagan later pointed out that, even when the truth emerged, CNN kept trying to “use the new information to support its own biased interpretation.”"
