    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”Former President Donald Trump has more than $122 million in cash spread across his post-presidency political operation and has made donations to dozens of Republican candidates for their midterm campaigns as he weighs another White House run, new Federal Election Commission filings show.<br />The former president raised more than $51 million during the last six months of 2021, the vast majority of which his political operation said, came from donations of less than $200 made online. The fundraising haul was less than he raised during the first six months of last year but still the most of any GOP figure during the second half of last year."
