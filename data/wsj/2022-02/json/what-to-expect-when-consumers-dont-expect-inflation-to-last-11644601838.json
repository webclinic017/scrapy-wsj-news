    "body": "Americans are bummed out about inflation. And yet they don’t seem to see it as a lasting problem.<br />The University of Michigan on Friday said that, in a preliminary reading, its measure of consumer sentiment among U.S. households fell to 61.7 this month from 67.2 in January. That was the lowest level since 2011.
