    "body": "Henry Mann of Huntingdon Valley, Pa., founder of Manncorp, a builder of electronic assembly equipment, and ELEDLights, a commercial lighting company, on his 1949 Oldsmobile Rocket 88, as told to A.J. Baime.<br />I can tell my family story through the cars I own. In 1937, my parents immigrated to America from Germany. They had nothing. My father worked for a family in Pasadena, Calif., and when my parents learned that my grandparents were coming in from Germany on a boat to Philadelphia, they drove across the country in a 1935 Buick. Today, I own a 1935 Buick, just like that car."
