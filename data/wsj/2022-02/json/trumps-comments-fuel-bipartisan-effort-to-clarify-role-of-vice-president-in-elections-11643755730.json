    "body": "WASHINGTON—A bipartisan effort to clarify the vice president’s role in certifying election results is gaining momentum and potentially expanding to include other areas of voting law, fueled by recent comments from former President Donald Trump that his former vice president should have overturned the result of the 2020 election.<br />Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) is leading a group of 16 senators in negotiations focused on overhauling the 135-year-old Electoral Count Act, or ECA. The push, emerging from the ashes of a broader Democratic voting-access bill that was blocked by Republicans, comes as members of both parties fear a replay of the contentious 2020 Electoral College process, when Mr. Trump refused to concede defeat and falsely blamed voting fraud for his loss."
