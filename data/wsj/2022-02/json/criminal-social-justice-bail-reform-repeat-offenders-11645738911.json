    "body": "Regarding William Bratton and Rafael Mangual’s op-ed “‘Bail Reform’ Is Killing New Yorkers” (Feb. 17): The old nostrum “better to let 10 guilty men go free than to convict one innocent man” apparently has an unspoken, modern corollary, evident in the social-justice approach to crime and public safety.
