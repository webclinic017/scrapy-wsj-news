    "body": "Size matters, at least when you’re playing Jack Reacher. The hero of more than two-dozen crime thrillers by the prolific Lee Child, the former military policeman is described in one Child novel as having “a six-pack like a cobbled city street, a chest like a suit of NFL armor, biceps like basketballs, and subcutaneous fat like a Kleenex tissue.” When Tom Cruise took on the role for what would be two films, a hue and cry was heard across Jack Reacher Land.<br />Has the new, eight-part “Reacher” overcompensated? Alan Ritchson, who has spent at least part of his career playing superheroes (Aquaman, Hawk, Raphael the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle), might not be quite 6-foot-5 like the literary Reacher, or have hands “the size of dinner plates” as Mr. Child once described his character. But he is a massive specimen. And, fortunately for the series, he’s gifted enough—and has a sufficient sense of understated humor—to sell a Reacher-worthy combination of menace, cynicism and even grudging warmth. It’s something that helps make the show one of the more watchable on TV, where there’s certainly no shortage of crime series. One can imagine this one going on forever."
