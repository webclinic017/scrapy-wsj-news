    "body": "Rep. Liz Cheney’s defense of the Jan. 6 Select Committee leaves readers with a fundamental misimpression about the committee and its work (“The Jan. 6 Committee Won’t Be Intimidated,” op-ed, Feb. 11).<br />The committee is anything but a fair and neutral finder of fact. Because House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took the unprecedented step of rejecting Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s chosen slate of Republicans, the committee lacks any semblance of objectivity. It is populated instead with members motivated by political vendettas—a bias that will ensure one-sided findings and distorted conclusions."
