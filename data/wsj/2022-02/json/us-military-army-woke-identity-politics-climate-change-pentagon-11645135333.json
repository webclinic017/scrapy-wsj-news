    "body": "When our son, then 19 years old, enlisted in the Army during the Iraq-war surge, I’m convinced he anticipated that his subsequent combat deployment would focus on the war on terror, not on being climate-change warriors or fighting for identity politics (“The Pentagon’s Political Priorities,” Review & Outlook, Feb. 12).<br />It was during that deployment that his mother and I had all the normal trepidations. As his parents, we took comfort in knowing that he, an infantryman in the 82nd Airborne Division, and his fellow paratroopers were highly trained, well-equipped, mission-ready and capably led. But is it out of the realm of possibility that a future military may become more distracted and consumed by its carbon footprint than the battle at hand?"
