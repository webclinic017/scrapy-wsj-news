    "body": "As Vladimir Putin considers how much of Ukraine to conquer, it’s worth recalling a moment when a U.S. presidential candidate was ridiculed by his opponent for being right about the Russian autocrat. We’re referring to Mitt Romney, the GOP nominee in 2012, who said at the time that Russia was America’s main geopolitical foe.<br />President Obama used the stage of a presidential debate to mock Mr. Romney. “Governor Romney, I’m glad that you recognize that al Qaeda’s a threat because a few months ago when you were asked, what’s the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia,” Mr. Obama said. “And the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the Cold War’s been over for 20 years.”"
