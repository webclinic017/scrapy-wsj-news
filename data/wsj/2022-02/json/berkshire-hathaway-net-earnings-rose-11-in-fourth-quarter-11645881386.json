    "body": "A growing economy propelled  Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s  railroad, energy and consumer businesses, pushing net earnings up 11% in the fourth quarter. And a powerful stock market nearly doubled the conglomerate’s investment gains for the full year.<br />Warren Buffett’s company reported $90 billion in net earnings in 2021, a record, thanks in part to its giant stock portfolio. Berkshire owns 5.6% of Apple Inc., a stake valued at $161.2 billion at the end of the year—up more than $40 billion from the year before."
