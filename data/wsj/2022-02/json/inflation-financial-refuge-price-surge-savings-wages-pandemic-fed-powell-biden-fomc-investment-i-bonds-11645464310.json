    "body": "Inflation is a clear and present danger to the American people. Extraordinary excesses in monetary and fiscal policy caused the inflation dragon to resurface after 40 years of dormancy.<br />Inflation is broadening across sectors and deepening in the minds of households. The price surge is triggering second- and third-order effects: higher wages are going to workers to offset accelerating prices; companies are passing cost increases to their customers with little friction. And forward-price indicators like commodities suggest prices are poised to increase further."
