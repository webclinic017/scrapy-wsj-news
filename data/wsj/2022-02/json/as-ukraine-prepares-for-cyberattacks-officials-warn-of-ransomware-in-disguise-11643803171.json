    "body": "As investigators in Ukraine continue to trace a January cyberattack that disrupted government websites and wiped data on computer systems, government officials and cybersecurity experts are preparing for another incident.<br />During last month’s attack, 90 websites, operated by 22 Ukrainian organizations, were defaced and a form of malicious software masquerading as ransomware destroyed a few dozen computers in two government agencies, according to Viktor Zhora, deputy chief of Ukraine’s State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection. This kind of software, known as a “wiper” because it wipes out data on a victim’s systems, destroyed more than 12,000 computers and disrupted government agencies and businesses in 2017."
