    "body": "Adidas  launched its new sports-bra campaign today with an unusual image: a grid of 25 sets of bare breasts. Aside from the surprise factor of the nudity, the breasts shown are only remarkable because they are completely normal. These are real breasts in all their perky, saggy, asymmetrical, varied forms.<br />The advertising promotes a new sports-bra collection that includes plus-size options and pieces designed for different activities. The brand tweeted: “We believe women’s breasts in all shapes and sizes deserve support and comfort. Which is why our new sports bra range contains 43 styles, so everyone can find the right fit for them.” A statement released by the brand read, “The gallery was designed to show just how diverse breasts are, featuring different shapes and sizes that highlight why tailored support is paramount."
