    "body": "WASHINGTON—Four female executives have resigned in recent months from the nonprofit foundation planning official commemorations of the U.S.’s 250th anniversary, saying its leaders have fostered a hostile and discriminatory workplace and dismissed concerns about a male employee’s questionable expenditures.<br />In an 11-page resignation letter sent in December to the America250 Foundation’s chief executive, Joseph Daniels, then-chief administration officer and chief of staff Renee Burchard said she was leaving “for my own professional ethical reasons as well as that the working conditions at America250 are hostile, toxic, retaliatory as well as discriminatory through actions/behaviors/comments based on sex and race.”"
