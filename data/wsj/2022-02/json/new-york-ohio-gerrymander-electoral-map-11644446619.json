    "body": "Your point about the gerrymandering of New York’s 10th District is well-founded (“New York’s Democratic Jerrymander,” Review & Outlook, Feb. 2). But Ohioans should take issue with your characterization of Ohio’s now-discarded electoral map as an “aggressive” gerrymander.<br />Consider the efforts to keep counties and communities whole: The map currently in place divides 23 of Ohio’s 88 counties, with two counties split four ways. Compare this with the map the Ohio Supreme Court recently threw out, which splits only 10 counties. The requirement to keep the division of the state’s five-largest counties to a minimum was met in the map the Ohio Supreme Court threw out."
