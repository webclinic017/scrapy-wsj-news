    "body": "Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine early Thursday marks the failure of Western deterrence and a return to the age of authoritarian conquest. Now we’ll see if Europe and the U.S. awaken from their illusions of eternal post-Cold War peace and security to address the new world disorder.<br />The first step is admitting the colossal Western misjudgment that Mr. Putin could be appeased. He snatched part of Georgia in 2008, and the world did little. He grabbed Crimea in 2014, and Barack Obama said there would be “costs” and Russia was “isolated.” But Western sanctions were weak. Europe watched this aggression and still made itself hostage to Russian energy supplies and blackmail. Europeans, of all people, forgot their own history of the 1930s."
