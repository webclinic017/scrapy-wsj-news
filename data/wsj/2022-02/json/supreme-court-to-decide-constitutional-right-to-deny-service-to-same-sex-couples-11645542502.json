    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court said Tuesday it would consider whether a Colorado website designer had a First Amendment right to refuse to produce same-sex wedding announcements, the latest clash between LGBT and religious rights.<br />Since its landmark 2015 decision extending marriage rights to same-sex couples, Obergefell v. Hodges, the high court has moved cautiously in carving out constitutional exemptions for organizations and business owners opposed to those rights."
