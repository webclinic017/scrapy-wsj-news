    "body": "In “The Fed Should Raise Interest Rates, but Gently” (op-ed, Feb. 7), Alan Blinder acknowledges his “‘happy’ scenario”—2% inflation, sluggish growth and stable unemployment—“isn’t the best guess” based on current data. He also concedes the Federal Reserve has been “a bit late” in ending its bond purchases and raising its interest-rate target.<br />Nevertheless, he suggests that some sort of economic calamity would arise if the Fed took a more aggressive approach against inflation. Why? If “team transitory” were correct, would the Fed be unable to ramp up bond buying? Would it be unable to reduce the interest-rate target as fast as it raised it? The Fed reduced the target by 475 basis points in less than a year in 2001."
