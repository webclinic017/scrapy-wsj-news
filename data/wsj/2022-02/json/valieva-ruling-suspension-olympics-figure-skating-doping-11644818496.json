    "body": "BEIJING—An international court on Monday allowed 15-year-old Russian figure skating star Kamila Valieva to compete in the women’s individual event starting Tuesday following the revelation of a positive doping test that has roiled the Beijing Olympics and thrown figure skating medals into limbo.<br />The ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport came as a surprise to many sports lawyers in the West and Russia. The drug that Valieva tested positive for, trimetazidine, is considered a risky substance that could be used to boost athletic performance under anti-doping rules and seemed to offer a narrow path for Valieva to overturn it."
