    "body": "WASHINGTON—Some Senate Republicans are criticizing President Biden’s pledge to place a Black woman on the Supreme Court, arguing he is paying a debt to a partisan constituency rather than seeking the most qualified nominee. But the practice of filling Supreme Court slots to court particular voter groups has a long bipartisan history.<br />For generations, presidents have used high-court appointments to send political signals and push their legal agendas, often by selecting nominees with specific characteristics. The big difference, legal scholars say, is Mr. Biden’s candor about excluding from consideration all outside a particular category."
