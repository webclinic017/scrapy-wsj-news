    "body": "South Korea is reviving a longstanding push to be upgraded to a developed market by  MSCI Inc.,  a change that could pull in more than $40 billion in foreign capital.<br />As an emerging market, South Korea ranks alongside countries such as Colombia, Egypt and the Philippines. That jars in a wealthy country that nowadays boasts the world’s 10th-largest economy, a $2.3 trillion stock market, high-tech heavyweights such as Samsung Electronics Co., and global soft power thanks to cultural exports like the  Netflix  series “Squid Game” and K-pop group BTS."
