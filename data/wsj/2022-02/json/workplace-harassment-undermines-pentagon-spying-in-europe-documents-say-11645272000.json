    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”Military diplomats operating in Europe are subject to what they describe as toxic workplace conditions that include colleagues spying on each other, undermining one another by exposing potentially derogatory information, and harassment of female colleagues.<br />The allegations about life inside an arm of the Defense Intelligence Agency are detailed in some 30 witness statements and complaints to the inspector general provided to lawmakers. These allegations, which were shared with the House and Senate intelligence committees, and a workplace climate survey that described widespread problems inside the service, were reviewed by The Wall Street Journal."
