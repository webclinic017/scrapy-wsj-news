    "body": "MEXICO CITY—A Sandinista judge Wednesday convicted seven Nicaraguan political and business leaders, including three would-be presidential candidates, of conspiring to damage the country’s sovereignty, a charge akin to treason.<br />The verdicts in the first mass trial of President Daniel Ortega’s opponents came days after 27 members of the Organization of American States, the Western Hemisphere’s most important regional group, denounced the deteriorating human rights conditions in Nicaragua and are a sign that Mr. Ortega is tightening his grip on power despite growing international isolation."
