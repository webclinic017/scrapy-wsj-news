    "body": "Legendary banker Nathan Mayer Rothschild’s supposed advice in the Napoleonic wars was to “buy when there’s blood in the streets.” It proved right when Russia seized Crimea in 2014, with Russian stocks in ruble terms soaring for nearly eight years.<br />This time, the sound of cannons in Ukraine spells bad news not just for Ukrainians but for the outlook for investors, too. Western politicians regarded Crimea as another part of the consolidation of Russia’s sphere of influence, on a par with Georgia, but really not worth getting that worked up about—it had been Russian until 1954, after all. The invasion of Ukraine is different, and makes real the undercurrent of concern about economic reliance on powerful autocrats and dictators who regard the West as the enemy."
