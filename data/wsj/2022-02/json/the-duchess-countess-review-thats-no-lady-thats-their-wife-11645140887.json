    "body": "Elizabeth Chudleigh may not be a familiar name from history, but she was the central figure in a dramatic scandal. Born in London in 1721, around the time of the South Sea Bubble, and dying near Paris in 1788, a year before revolution broke out, she played a notable, even notorious, social role both in England and on the Continent. She was a duchess and a countess—or perhaps neither.<br />Her first marriage, to a naval officer, was clandestine and later denied by both parties. If it was legal—a matter of some dispute—then her marriage more than 20 years later to a rich aristocrat was bigamous. Indeed, she would stand trial for bigamy in the House of Lords. In “The Duchess Countess,” Catherine Ostler draws a vivid portrait of this remarkable woman."
