    "body": "Allison Gollust resigned as CNN’s communications and marketing chief after the network’s parent determined she misled investigators about her relationship with former President Jeff Zucker and violated CNN’s news standards, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Ms. Gollust’s resignation came amid an investigation that originally focused on former prime-time anchor Chris Cuomo’s efforts to help his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, respond to accusations of sexual misconduct. The investigation eventually ensnared three of CNN’s biggest players: network president Mr. Zucker, Chris Cuomo and Ms. Gollust."
