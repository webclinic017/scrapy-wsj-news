    "body": "<br />Cecil Taylor (1929-2018) is the most influential jazz pianist of the late 20th century. Some of today’s leading keyboard masters, including Kris Davis, Vijay Iyer, Matthew Shipp and Craig Taborn, cite him as a cornerstone influence. Yet some of the major early, evolutionary chapters of Taylor’s unique style—which could switch gears from thunderous bombast to sublime elegance with lightning speed and breathtaking virtuosity—are poorly documented. He was recorded only sporadically in the ’50s and ’60s, and barely at all in the early ‘70s, before re-emerging almost fully formed in the mid-’70s, from which time he was recorded often and won numerous accolades for his work."
