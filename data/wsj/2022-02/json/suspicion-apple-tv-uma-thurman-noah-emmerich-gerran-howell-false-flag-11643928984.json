    "body": "In this confidently ambitious, taut and not infrequently exhausting tale of abduction, family lives are upended. And what, you may ask, is unusual about that? “Suspicion” (begins with two episodes Friday, Apple TV+) quickly begins delivering the answer in it’s eight richly complicated parts, all saturated with steely irony: The series is, in short, not without humor of a bitter kind.<br />Based on the Israeli TV thriller “False Flag,” “Suspicion” takes its grim fun-poking seriously. The abductors who pounce on their victim and stuff him violently into a suitcase wear revoltingly cheery face masks—all caricatures of the Royal Family. That victim, Leo Newman (Gerran Howell), is the 20-ish son of Katherine Newman, prominent American head of a high-powered U.S. public-relations firm (a thoroughly persuasive Uma Thurman) now on her way to take up her new role as U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom."
