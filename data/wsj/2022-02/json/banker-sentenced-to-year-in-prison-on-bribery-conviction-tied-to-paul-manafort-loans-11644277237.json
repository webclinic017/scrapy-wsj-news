    "body": "A former bank executive was sentenced Monday to a year and a day in prison for corruptly arranging $16 million in loans to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in an effort to obtain a high-ranking government job.<br />Stephen Calk, the founder and former chairman of the Federal Savings Bank in Chicago, was convicted last year of financial-institution bribery and conspiracy to commit financial-institution bribery. Federal prosecutors said Mr. Calk pushed the bank to approve the loans for Mr. Manafort, despite red flags, because he wanted a Trump administration post."
