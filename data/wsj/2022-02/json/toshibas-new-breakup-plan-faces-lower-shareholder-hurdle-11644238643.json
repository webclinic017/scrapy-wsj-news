    "body": "TOKYO— Toshiba Corp.’s  revised plan to break into two parts instead of three might not fully satisfy foreign shareholders who want more radical restructuring but it offers an easier path for the company to divide itself.<br />The Japanese conglomerate said Monday that under the new plan, it would spin off its device business, which makes power semiconductors that have been sought-after during pandemic-era supply crunches. The remaining unit would manage Toshiba’s other assets, including infrastructure, in a change targeted to take place by March 2024."
