    "body": "Teiranni Kidd arrived at an Alabama hospital for a scheduled caesarean section in July 2020. When her daughter was delivered, the umbilical cord was wrapped around the neck; the baby died several months later from complications caused by severe brain damage.<br />In a lawsuit, Ms. Kidd alleges that the hospital withheld a key piece of information: Several days before her admission, it was hit by a massive ransomware attack, which compromised the communications network that included the fetal heartbeat monitors in the labor and delivery wards."
