    "body": "WASHINGTON—House Democrats introduced a resolution Wednesday that would recognize congressional staff’s right to unionize, but many details of the nascent organizing effort remain unresolved.<br />The resolution, introduced by Rep. Andy Levin (D., Mich.) and 130 co-sponsors, builds on the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, which allowed various legislative-branch workers to unionize, including employees of the U.S. Capitol Police, Library of Congress and the Architect of the Capitol. Mr. Levin’s resolution would provide the ability for House  staffers who work in personal offices, district offices and committees. Separate legislation would have to be passed for Senate staff to unionize."
