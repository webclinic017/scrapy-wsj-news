    "body": "WASHINGTON—Sen. Marsha Blackburn lifted a hold on a stopgap bill needed to avoid a partial government shutdown this weekend after she won a commitment from the Biden administration that it wouldn’t fund pipes for smoking illicit substances through a substance-abuse program.<br />The Tennessee Republican had said she would hold up the bill until the Department of Health and Human Services clarified in writing whether it intended to pay for pipes to smoke illicit substances. The topic became a major issue in conservative circles after the Washington Free Beacon reported that a $30 million harm-reduction grant program operated by an agency within HHS could include money to put pipes in safe-smoking kits, which the report said could include crack pipes."
