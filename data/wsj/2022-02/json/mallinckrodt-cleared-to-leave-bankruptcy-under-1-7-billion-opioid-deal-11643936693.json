    "body": "Mallinckrodt  PLC has won court approval to settle its opioid-related liabilities for roughly $1.7 billion and exit chapter 11 under a broader reorganization deal that will hand control to creditors and cut about $1.3 billion in debt.<br />Judge John Dorsey of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., on Thursday approved the opioid settlement and Mallinckrodt’s broader chapter 11 reorganization plan, capping a monthslong trial. Dublin-based Mallinckrodt has said the company also needs approval from Irish authorities before its chapter 11 plan can go into effect."
