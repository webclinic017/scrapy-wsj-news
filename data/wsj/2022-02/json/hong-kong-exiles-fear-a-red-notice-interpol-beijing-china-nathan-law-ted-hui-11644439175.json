    "body": "As the Communist Party snuffs out freedom in Hong Kong, it has also sought to extend the crackdown past its borders. China’s national security law asserts world-wide authority to police dissent against its government, and there’s reason to fear that Beijing will try to use Interpol to harass Hong Kongers in exile.<br />Sixteen supporters of Hong Kong’s freedom movement are raising precisely that concern. They include former Hong Kong lawmakers Ted Hui and Nathan Law, as well as Mark Simon, an American and longtime top aide to Hong Kong’s imprisoned publisher Jimmy Lai. In an open letter in January organized by NGO Safeguard Defenders, they asked Interpol to ensure they aren’t unjustly targeted for what amounts to political crimes against China."
