    "body": "A move by  Airbus  to fly under the radar could be a wise one.<br />Shares in the European plane maker initially rose Thursday, after it released encouraging financial results for the final quarter. Operating earnings were 11% above the median analyst estimate. Free cash flow, which is even more important for aerospace firms, was almost twice as high as expected for the quarter, and amounted to €3.5 billion, equivalent to $4 billion, for 2021 overall. That echoes a better-than-expected cash performance at  Boeing ,  its American rival."
