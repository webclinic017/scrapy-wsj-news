    "body": "Electronic Arts  will survive its Battlefield wound just fine. Thriving in the videogame industry’s consolidation war might be a little trickier, as the soon-to-be largest independent publisher seems likely to remain a solo player.<br />In its fiscal third-quarter results late Tuesday, EA confirmed that “Battlefield 2042”—the latest installment of its popular shooter franchise—had a disappointing launch during the period. The result was total bookings for the quarter coming in at roughly $2.58 billion—3% below Wall Street’s expectations. The company is planning fixes and updates to the game, but said it would push out the first season of live services for the title to summer to enact those changes first. EA thus cut about $100 million from its bookings forecast for the full fiscal year ending in March."
