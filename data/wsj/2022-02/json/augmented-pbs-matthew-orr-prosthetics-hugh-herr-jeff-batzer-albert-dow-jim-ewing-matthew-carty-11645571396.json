    "body": "‘I would love to become a cyborg,” says the MIT biophysicist Hugh Herr, whose state-of-the-art prosthetic legs—and agile use of them—prompt glib suggestions that he’s a “bionic man.” What’s revealed in “Augmented,” a “Nova” presentation about revolutionary advances in robotic limbs and surgery, is how far Mr. Herr thinks he and his colleagues still can go. And his belief that artificially enabled people actually have an advantage over standard-issue humans.<br />As disturbing as the premise might be in director Matthew Orr’s multiple-narrative documentary, Mr. Herr’s position—and the implication that healthy people may someday opt for amputation and prosthetics if the technology continues to progress—begins with the story of how he lost his legs. In January 1982, when he was 17 years old, Mr. Herr—a “child prodigy” of rock-climbing—became disoriented during a trip to the White Mountains of New Hampshire where he and companion Jeff Batzer spent several days in a blizzard and minus-20-degree temperatures, trying to stay warm by hugging each other. Because of frostbite, Mr. Herr eventually required the amputation of both legs below the knee; Mr. Batzer, who also appears in the film, lost the fingers on one hand, the toes on a foot and one of his legs. That one of the 150-member search-and-rescue team died during the hunt for the two climbers—a young man named Albert Dow—haunts Mr. Herr, who credits Dow as an inspiration for what he’s subsequently accomplished."
