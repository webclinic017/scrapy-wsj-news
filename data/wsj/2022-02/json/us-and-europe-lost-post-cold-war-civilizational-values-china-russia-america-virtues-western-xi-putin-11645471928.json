    "body": "In the 1970s, not much more than a quarter-century after the conflict in which Japan and Germany had been comprehensively vanquished, their economic performance—the growth in their productivity, output and living standards—eclipsed that of the principal victors in that war. As the U.S. and British economies slogged through a decade of stagflation, Americans and Brits rushed to buy Japanese and German cars, televisions, washing machines, semiconductors and billions of yen and marks of exports that were far superior to our own notoriously inefficient and malfunctioning machines, heightening the sense that global power had shifted decisively toward these emerging economic engines.<br />One activity in which the Anglo-Saxons will always prevail is self-deprecation, and a joke at the time typically captured the mood: “World War II is over, and Japan and Germany have won it.”"
