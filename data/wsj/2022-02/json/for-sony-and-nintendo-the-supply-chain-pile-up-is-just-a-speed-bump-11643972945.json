    "body": "Supply-chain shortages continue to be a near-term challenge for  Sony  and  Nintendo .  But their underlying businesses are still going strong.<br />Anyone who has tried to buy a PlayStation 5 realizes just how tight supply is right now. And Sony’s results for last quarter, announced Wednesday, confirmed that. The Japanese company shipped 3.9 million of the videogame consoles for the quarter ended December, meaning it only managed a slight increase for the holiday season compared with the previous quarter. And Sony is now expecting to sell 11.5 million PS5 for the fiscal year ending in March, down from its previous forecast of 14.8 million units, as it expects component shortages to continue. Sony’s shares fell 6% Thursday."
