    "body": "After an astonishing 20-year run with Bill Belichick’s New England Patriots, Tom Brady won his seventh championship ring last year, at the age of 43, as he led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers over the Kansas City Chiefs. Then he almost swamped interest in this year’s big game when news of his retirement was leaked, denied, then finally announced. The media frenzy Brady touched off confirmed, as if any confirmation were needed, that he is indeed the greatest pro-football quarterback of all time.<br />Brady and Belichick are the NFL’s odd couple—as disparate and symbiotic as Felix and Oscar: sleek, adroit Brady, with his highlighted hair and highlight reel of touchdown passes; and grumpy, dumpy Belichick, a gridiron genius in a schlumpy hoodie with the sleeves cut off at the biceps and a spectacular record on the sidelines. Their twinned story—as much soap opera as sports saga—is told in Seth Wickersham’s “It’s Better to Be Feared: The New England Patriots Dynasty and the Pursuit of Greatness.” It’s a superlative sports book full of intimate, fly-on-the-wall reporting, savvy insights and deft, page-turning writing."
