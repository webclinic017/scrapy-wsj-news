    "body": "Never has the editorial board been so wrong as when it characterizes rooftop solar with the “welfare” label (“California’s Solar-Power Welfare State,” Feb. 8). My solar panels power my home during daylight and charge the battery. The battery powers my home, except for the air conditioning, during the night. Instead of electricity bills of $800 to $1,000 before panels were installed, my average monthly bill is below $50.<br />My panels generate excess electricity, which is routed to the grid, and I get paid for it—but at a severely discounted rate. Last year I sold electricity to SoCalEd that would have cost over $1,000, but I was compensated less than $100. That isn’t welfare."
