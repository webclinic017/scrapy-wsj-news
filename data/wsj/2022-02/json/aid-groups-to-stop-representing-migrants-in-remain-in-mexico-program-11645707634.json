    "body": "EL PASO, Texas—Some prominent border aid groups are refusing the federal government’s requests to provide legal representation to people in the program known as Remain in Mexico, in what they say is an effort to pressure the Biden administration to end it permanently.<br />The Biden administration recently restarted the program as required by a court order after stopping it last winter. The program, officially called Migrant Protection Protocols, or MPP, sends migrants who illegally enter the U.S. to Mexico to wait until their requests for asylum are resolved in U.S. courts."
