    "body": "MEXICO CITY—The U.S. government suspended imports of Mexican avocados after one of its inspectors in Michoacán, Mexico’s principal producing state, received a threatening phone call.<br />The Agriculture Ministry said at the weekend that the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service halted inspections in the state until further notice. The suspension came on Super Bowl weekend, a time when U.S. demand for Mexican avocados is particularly high as Americans eat more guacamole than at any other time of the year."
