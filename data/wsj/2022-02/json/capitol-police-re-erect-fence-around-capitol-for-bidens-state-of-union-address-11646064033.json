    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. Capitol Police reinstalled a fence around the Capitol building ahead of President Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday and possible protests, as law-enforcement officials said they are bolstering security around Washington.<br />Authorities have been preparing for the annual speech before a joint session of Congress, which routinely involves significant security preparations, as well as the added factor of potential trucker protests, following recent demonstrations in Canada that called for all Covid-19 vaccine mandates and related social restrictions to be lifted."
