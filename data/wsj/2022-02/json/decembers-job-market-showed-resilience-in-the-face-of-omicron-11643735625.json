    "body": "What happened with the job market in December is in many respects old news. It just isn’t as old as it used to be.<br />The Labor Department on Tuesday said that there were a seasonally adjusted 10.93 million job openings at the end of December, up from 10.78 million in November and close to the 11.09 million notched in October. That amounts to 1.7 open jobs for every person classified as unemployed in December."
