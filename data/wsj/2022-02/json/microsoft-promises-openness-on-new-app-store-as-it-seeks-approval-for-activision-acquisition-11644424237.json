    "body": "Microsoft Corp.  executives promised that the marketplace they are envisioning for videogames would operate by a set of open-market principles, part of a pitch to regulators around the world to approve its acquisition of gaming giant  Activision Blizzard Inc.<br />The principles are a response to concerns raised by app developers and lawmakers, who say app stores run by  Apple Inc.  and others take an unfairly large cut of digital revenues and stifle competition. Microsoft said it wouldnâ€™t require developers to use a proprietary payment system, among other steps."
