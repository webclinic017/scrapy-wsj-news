    "body": "HSBC  Holdings PLC set new targets to reduce the emissions from its lending, but an advocacy group pushing for investor action on climate change criticized the plan because it doesn’t cover the bank’s whole carbon footprint.<br />London-based HSBC, one of the world’s biggest fossil-fuel lenders, on Tuesday set out targets to reduce its exposure to the sector. The plan would see emissions from oil-and-gas companies that HSBC lends to falling by 34% by 2030 from 2019 levels. The bank said that goal is in line with an International Energy Agency emissions scenario that would limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century."
