    "body": "The question of who is likely to spend even faster in the near future—and who might not be—is roiling payments stocks.<br />Shares of  PayPal  are plunging after the company lowered its expected pace of revenue growth in 2022, as well as its aspiration for user growth. It cited things such as the effects of supply-chain disruption on cross-border spending, and inflation on consumer sentiment and personal consumption—particularly among its lower-income users. It also noted that some of the newly added customers during the pandemic weren’t contributing much in the way of revenue, just making one transaction when encouraged to do so and then going dormant."
