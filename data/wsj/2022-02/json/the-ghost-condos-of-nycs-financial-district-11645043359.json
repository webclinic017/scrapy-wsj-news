    "body": "In October 2018, Linda Gerstman signed a contract for her dream apartment, a $4.6 million duplex spread at One Seaport, a gleaming new 57-story glass building under construction along the East River in the Financial District near the Brooklyn Bridge.<br />Ms. Gerstman took a hard-hat tour of the construction site. “I fell in love,” she said. “The views were insane.” Ms. Gerstman, 51, an executive at a retail services company, planned to move into her new apartment within about a year when the building was expected to be completed. Four years later, the building sits unfinished and although she has gotten her deposit money back, she’s in a legal battle with the developers to get back money she paid for upgrades to the unit."
