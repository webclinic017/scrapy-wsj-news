    "body": "When billionaire Jacqui Safra hired Nikki Field to sell his New York City penthouse last year, he made a series of demands. Mr. Safra, a descendant of the Lebanese-Brazilian banking family, told the real-estate agent she had three months to quietly drum up interest in the Upper East Side triplex without listing it on the public market, Ms. Field recalled.<br />There were no professional photos of the Fifth Avenue co-op—just one snapshot of Central Park taken from the terrace—and Ms. Field, of Sotheby’s International Realty, was given access to the apartment for a single day of showings."
