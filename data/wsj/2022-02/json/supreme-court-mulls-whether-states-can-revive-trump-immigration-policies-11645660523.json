    "body": "WASHINGTON—Several Supreme Court justices criticized a legal maneuver the Biden administration used to cancel Trump-era immigration rules that denied green cards to some lawful immigrants who obtained public assistance.<br />The criticism came Wednesday as justices considered whether to allow Republican-leaning states to defend in court the Trump administration’s green card restrictions that the Biden administration has since dropped."
