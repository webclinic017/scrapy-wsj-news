    "body": "‘In the history of the American West,” writes Susan Jonusas, “few historical figures have captured the public imagination like the outlaw. . . . The word itself evokes nonconformity, the promise of freedom, the choice to carve out your own path against the status quo.” Even such homicidal renegades as Jesse James and Billy the Kid are covered in a flattering haze. But the family of four known as the “Bloody Benders,” the subjects of Ms. Jonusas’s “Hell’s Half-Acre,” committed crimes so vile that they resist glamorization.<br />This strange foursome had settled in Labette County, in southeast Kansas, by 1871. The area, Ms. Jonusas writes, was “a haven for those on the run from the law or seeking to make a living outside it.” Taking advantage of the Homestead Act, the Bender ensemble staked a land claim and built a cabin offering “GROCRYS” and a night’s rest to travelers on the plain."
