    "body": "The Justice Department is ending a Trump-era initiative to counter national-security threats from China after it led to a series of failed prosecutions of academics that sowed broad distrust in the higher-education community.<br />The agency will set a high bar for cases alleging that U.S. scientists lied to the federal agencies that fund their research about their ties to China, Assistant Attorney General for National Security Matthew Olsen said in a Wednesday briefing with reporters. He said the department would now pursue only instances where prosecutors perceive clear criminal misconduct with clear connections to U.S. national- or economic-security interests."
