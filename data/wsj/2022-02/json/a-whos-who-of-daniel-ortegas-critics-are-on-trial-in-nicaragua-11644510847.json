    "body": "In 1978, Dora María Téllez was just 22 years old when she led a Sandinista attack on Nicaragua’s National Palace. She and other guerrillas held hostage legislators loyal to then-dictator Anastasio Somoza until they were exchanged for captured Sandinista rebels.<br />A year later, those rebels overthrew the regime, propelling into power the leftist Sandinista movement, whose leader, President Daniel Ortega, has ruled the country for the past 15 years."
