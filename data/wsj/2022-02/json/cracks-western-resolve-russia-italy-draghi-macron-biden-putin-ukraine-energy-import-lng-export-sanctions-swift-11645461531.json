    "body": "French President Emmanuel Macron scrambled Sunday to stop a Russian invasion of Ukraine by arranging a possible summit between President Biden and Vladimir Putin. It’s hard to see what the Russian will accept beyond concessions that would compromise NATO’s security, and meanwhile Italy is already blinking on sanctions.<br />U.S. officials at the weekend Munich Security Conference kept insisting how unified the trans-Atlantic alliance is in the face of Russian aggression. It’s almost as if they are trying to convince themselves as much as Mr. Putin, since they know the cracks that exist below the surface claims of resolve and unity."
