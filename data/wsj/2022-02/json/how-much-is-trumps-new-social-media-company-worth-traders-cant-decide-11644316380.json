    "body": "Traders are struggling to place a consistent value on Donald Trump’s new social-media venture, a business that hasn’t offered much in the way of details but one that supporters think is destined to take off.<br />Shares and warrants of  Digital World Acquisition Corp. , the special-purpose acquisition company that is merging with Trump Media & Technology Group, tell two different valuation stories. The SPAC’s shares have traded around $80 in recent days, preserving a 700% rally since the deal was announced in October. They are up more than 60% this year, bucking a broad selloff that has sent other SPACs and stocks that are popular among individual investors, such as  GameStop  Corp. , tumbling."
