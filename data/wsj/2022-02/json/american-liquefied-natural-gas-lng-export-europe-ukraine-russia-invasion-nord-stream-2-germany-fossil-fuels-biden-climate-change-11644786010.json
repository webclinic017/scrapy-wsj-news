    "body": "To understand the strategic benefit of U.S. fossil fuels, consider how liquefied natural gas exports are riding to the rescue of Europe in the Ukraine crisis. Bloomberg reports that on Saturday all seven U.S. LNG export terminals had tankers docked or loading for the first time, with much of the gas headed to Europe.<br />Demand for U.S. exports helped set a record 13.3 billion cubic feet of gas loading at the LNG export terminals. Demand is so great that regulators have let tankers fill up at the Calcasieu Pass plant in Louisiana, which is still under construction."
