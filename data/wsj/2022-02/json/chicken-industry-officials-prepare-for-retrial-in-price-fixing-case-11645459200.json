    "body": "Executives who worked for some of the biggest U.S. chicken producers are set to stand trial for a second time beginning Tuesday, as they battle Justice Department accusations that they conspired to fix prices.<br />The government’s case against the 10 former poultry executives previously ended in a mistrial in December after jurors failed to reach consensus on a verdict after several days of deliberations. Prosecutors decided to pursue a retrial, which is expected to last 22 days in a federal court in Colorado."
