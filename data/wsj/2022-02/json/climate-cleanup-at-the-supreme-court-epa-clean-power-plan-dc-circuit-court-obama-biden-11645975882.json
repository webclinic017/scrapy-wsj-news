    "body": "Monday is cleanup duty at the Supreme Court, as the Justices take up an errant decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last year that revived the Obama Clean Power Plan—the same rule they blocked six years ago.<br />At issue in West Virginia v. EPA  is whether Congress gave the Environmental Protection Agency a limitless license to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. States and coal companies aren’t asking the Court to reverse its misconceived Massachusetts v. EPA (2009) precedent that empowered the EPA to regulate CO2 emissions, though that deserves to be revisited."
