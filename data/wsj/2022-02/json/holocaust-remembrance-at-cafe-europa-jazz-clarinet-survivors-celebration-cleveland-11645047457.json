    "body": "Cleveland<br />I played clarinet last month at Café Europa, a Holocaust survivors’ daytime drop-in program. Some of the audience talked during my show, but who has the nerve to tell Holocaust survivors to stop kibitzing? Not me. Harry from Poland and Gary from Romania chattered away 10 feet from me. I said, “Keep talking, guys. I’ll play lounge music, and you just keep talking.” I played the old jazz standard “Misty.” Afterward I said, “All we need are cigarettes, like the old days.” Then we talked about cigarettes. Charlotte, a Czech, said that in her hometown only the men had smoked."
