    "body": "The union war on charter schools never ends, and the latest ruse in New York is to limit who can authorize a charter. A bill from Democratic state Sen. John Liu would give the state Board of Regents veto power over all charter applications—including those approved by the state’s biggest authorizer, the State University of New York.<br />The New York State Charter Schools Act of 1998 gave SUNY and the Board of Regents authority to approve charter applications. Some 60% of 358 charter schools across the state have been authorized by SUNY, including most belonging to high-performing Success Academy and KIPP. With trustees appointed by the Governor, SUNY is freer from teachers union influence than the Regents, whose members are appointed by the state Legislature and oversee the state Education Department."
