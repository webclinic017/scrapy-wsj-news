    "body": "Who knows what to make of Friday’s report on January jobs? The employer survey showed a blowout of 467,000 net new jobs for the month, but the numbers were skewed by major Labor Department revisions for the U.S. population and civilian employment. Without those changes, the jobs number would have declined. Add the complexities of adjusting for winter weather and Covid’s Omicron variant, and no one should make too much of this one monthly report.<br />The number worth pondering is the increase of 0.7% in average hourly earnings in the month. That’s a barn-burner number—9.2% at an annual rate. Hourly wages are up 5.7% over the last 12 months, and they are rising fast. That’s good news for workers, who are getting raises that are trying to keep pace with inflation. Employers are paying more—and not only to the hospitality and leisure workers they are trying to lure back to work amid Covid. Wage gains are moving across the workforce, including in supervisory positions."
