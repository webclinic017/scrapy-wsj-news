    "body": "The U.S. and its European allies promised to meet Russia’s military assault on Ukraine with economic penalties—and are doing so in response. Punitive measures rolled out so far target Russia’s financial sector, major companies, government officials, members of the elite, President Vladimir Putin and the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline. The U.S. and European governments say more are forthcoming.<br />Economic sanctions, export controls and other measures became the main tools of retaliation for the West after President Biden said that the U.S. wouldn’t send troops to defend Ukraine, which isn’t a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."
