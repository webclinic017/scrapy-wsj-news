    "body": "AT FIRST GLANCE, Lisa le Duc’s oasis-like garage doesn’t appear to accommodate actual automobiles, but it does. “I wanted a space that was an extension of a mudroom and kitchen and just nicer to be in than a garage,” said the English interior designer of her Tiburon, Calif., room. She transformed the square footage into a multipurpose retreat that can easily be cleared when she needs to house cars. Her design arsenal: beadboard, sage-green paint, a cream-colored kitchenette and a decorative but drivable epoxy-coat deck. A garage “doesn’t have to be all metal shelving and a horrible floor, a room nobody bothered to paint,” she said.<br />She likens the visual organization of the space to that of a kitchen, which “generally all has the same units, the same hardware and the same finished surfaces.” The designer honored the room’s original purpose through low-tech references, including oil-rubbed pulls and knobs. “They’re black, metal, really nice, chunky, solid hardware,” she said. “I didn’t want it to be brass and shiny and pretty. I needed it to be industrial.”"
