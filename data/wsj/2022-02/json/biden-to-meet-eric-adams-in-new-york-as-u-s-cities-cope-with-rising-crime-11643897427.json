    "body": "WASHINGTON—With murder rates in many U.S. cities rising, President Biden traveled to New York City on Thursday to highlight federal efforts to fight gun violence.<br />During a visit to the New York Police Department headquarters, Mr. Biden spoke of the need to restore trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. As he has done since 2020, Mr. Biden also explicitly rejected cutting funding for police departments, an idea that has been politically costly for some Democrats."
