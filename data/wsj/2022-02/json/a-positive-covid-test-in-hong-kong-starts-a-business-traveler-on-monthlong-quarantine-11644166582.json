    "body": "HONG KONG—When Yudi Soetjiptadi made it back home to Hong Kong in December after a business trip to Africa, he knew he would have to spend a week in a city quarantine center and then 14 more days of isolation in a hotel. Then he tested positive for Covid-19. It was the start of a monthlong odyssey.<br />Two days after his arrival, Mr. Soetjiptadi, who runs his own exhibition business, was in quarantine at Penny’s Bay, a makeshift village of repurposed shipping containers on Fantasy Road next to Hong Kong’s Disneyland, when he came down with a fever and received a positive test result for the then still-new Omicron variant."
