    "body": "A Russian invasion of Ukraine would have devastating humanitarian consequences, and one of them might be another refugee crisis in Europe. Let’s hope the Continent does better this time.<br />Ukraine aspires to join the European Union, though it is still years away from doing so if it ever happens. But Ukrainians already enjoy visa-free travel to the EU, and the country shares a border with EU states Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. Countless Ukrainian refugees could seek safety in these countries if Vladimir Putin tries to grab more territory."
