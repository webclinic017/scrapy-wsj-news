    "body": "WARSAW—Europe’s top court ruled on Wednesday that the European Union could withhold money for member countries that have curtailed the independence of their democratic institutions, marking a potentially costly defeat for Hungary and Poland.<br />The ruling, by the EU’s European Court of Justice, gives the bloc more power to clamp down on governments accused of purging their judiciary or weakening anticorruption watchdog agencies. Under the decision, the EU could block those countries from receiving money if it can show that their lack of independent courts or their weak anticorruption agencies present a risk that the EU’s money—meant for the building of roads, trains, bridges and other social programs—could be misspent."
