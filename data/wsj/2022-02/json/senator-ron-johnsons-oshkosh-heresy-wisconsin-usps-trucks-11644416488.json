    "body": "Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson has some nerve. The Republican is refusing to bully  Oshkosh Corp.  to manufacture United States Postal Service trucks in his home state. He deserves a taxpayer commendation.<br />USPS last winter awarded Oshkosh a contract to build a new delivery fleet of up to 165,000 trucks to replace its 30-year-old clunkers. But a political backfire transpired after Oshkosh said it would build the trucks at a new factory in South Carolina, a right-to-work state. That makes it less likely that workers at the new plant will unionize."
