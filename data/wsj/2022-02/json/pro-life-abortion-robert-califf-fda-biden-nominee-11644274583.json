    "body": "Your editorial “Robert Califf for the FDA” (Jan. 31) unfairly dismissed well-documented pro-life and public-health concerns with President Biden’s nominee. While serving as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration under President Obama, Dr. Califf authorized the weakening of data reporting requirements on medical complications that result from chemical abortions, obscuring the real dangers these drugs pose to women and girls.<br />Recent large-scale, peer-reviewed research shows that the rate of chemical abortion-related emergency-room visits is increasing—more than 500% since the early 2000s. Complications can be life-threatening. Yet under Dr. Califf’s direction, the FDA in 2016 stopped requiring adverse events short of death to be reported. Dr. Califf did not address his role in that decision in his committee hearing. Instead, he told the committee that he trusted the FDA’s decision would be based on the best available data—data that is woefully inadequate due to his past actions as FDA commissioner."
