    "body": "Regarding your editorial “The Best Summary of the 2020 Election” (Jan. 26): The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL) report includes a flawed estimate of the quantitative impact of the Mark Zuckerberg-funded Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL) injection of around $10.3 million into Wisconsin election offices, about 90% of which went to a handful of Wisconsin’s most heavily Democratic cities.<br />WILL’s estimate is based on the assumption that any CTCL-related “anomalies” in Wisconsin are randomly distributed. But we know that any such anomalies were limited to the very small set of heavily Democratic cities that received large grants. This causes WILL to seriously underestimate the impact of CTCL spending on President Biden’s Wisconsin vote totals."
