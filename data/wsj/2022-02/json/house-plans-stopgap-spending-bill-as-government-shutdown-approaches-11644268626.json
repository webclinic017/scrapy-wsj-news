    "body": "WASHINGTON—House leaders scheduled a Tuesday vote to extend a temporary government funding measure through March 11, buying time for negotiators to work out a comprehensive fiscal 2022 package after a prolonged deadlock over how much to allocate for military and nondefense spending.<br />House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro (D., Conn.) said that negotiators are “close to reaching a framework government funding agreement, but we will need additional time to complete the legislation in full.”"
