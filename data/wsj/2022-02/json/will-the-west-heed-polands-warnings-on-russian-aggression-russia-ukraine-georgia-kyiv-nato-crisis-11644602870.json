    "body": "Warsaw<br />‘We are here to express our full solidarity with you,” Poland’s then-President Lech Kaczyński declared in an August 2008 speech in Tbilisi, Georgia. He called on the European Union and North Atlantic Treaty Organization to meet Russia’s recent invasion of the former Soviet republic with resolute opposition. “We know perfectly well that while today is time for Georgia, tomorrow it may be time for Ukraine, then for the Baltic States, and later, perhaps, for my own country, Poland!”"
