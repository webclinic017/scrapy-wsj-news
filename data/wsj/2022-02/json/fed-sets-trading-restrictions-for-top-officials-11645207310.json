    "body": "The Federal Reserve formally adopted new ethics rules aimed at limiting financial-market trading by its top officials, senior staff and close family members.<br />The central bank revealed the broad contours of these new rules last fall following disclosures of active trading by some of its officials, and it expanded the scope of the restrictions in their final form. The Fed on Friday said the new rules “aim to support public confidence in the impartiality and integrity of the [interest-rate-setting Federal Open Market] Committee’s work by guarding against even the appearance of any conflict of interest.”"
