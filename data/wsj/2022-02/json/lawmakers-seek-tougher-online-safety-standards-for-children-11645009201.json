    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”Social-media companies would be held responsible for harm they cause to children under bipartisan legislation being introduced Wednesday, in the latest move to strengthen regulation of internet platforms.<br />Dubbed the Kids Online Safety Act, the measure by Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) and Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) would also require tech companies to provide periodic assessments of how their algorithms, design features and targeted advertising systems might contribute to harm to minors. Tech companies would have to give minors the ability to opt out of algorithmic recommendations."
