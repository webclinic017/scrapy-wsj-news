    "body": "Even if you don’t follow tennis, you’ve probably heard of Roger Federer. In his 24-year career, the 40-year-old Swiss athlete has won almost every honor in professional tennis, including eight Wimbledon titles. His name is synonymous with a sport the way Babe Ruth, Michael Jordan and Tom Brady epitomize baseball, basketball and football.<br />Another Roger recently ended his pro tennis career. On Feb. 16, Brazilian Rogério Dutra Silva, 38, quietly called it quits after losing in the first round of the men’s doubles competition in Rio de Janeiro. “I feel great. . . . Everybody is here, family, friends. . . . It was a perfect way to end,” Mr. Dutra Silva said after his loss in the Rio Open."
