    "body": "Americans are starting to wonder if the U.S. could win a war against a formidable adversary like China. So here is an accumulating risk that deserves more attention: American military pilots aren’t getting enough preparation for high-end combat.<br />The armed services are still trying to recover from sequester budget cuts, which started in 2013 and brutalized readiness. Many pilots who came up in the aftermath of those cuts haven’t had the flight hours they need to perform superbly in a fight with a near-peer military. Cramped and inconsistent budgets are compounding this skills deficit, even as the world grows more dangerous."
