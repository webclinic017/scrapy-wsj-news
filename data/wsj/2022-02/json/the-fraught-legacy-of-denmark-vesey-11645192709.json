    "body": "In March 1863, three months after the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect, Frederick Douglass barnstormed across the Northeast encouraging Black men to enlist in the Union army. In his recruitment speech, titled “Men of Color, to Arms!”, he exhorted his audience, “Remember Denmark Vesey of Charleston.”<br />Vesey had been executed 40 years earlier, on July 2, 1822, after being convicted on a charge of “attempting to raise an Insurrection amongst the Blacks against the Whites.” For Douglass, Vesey was one of the “glorious martyrs” of anti-slavery, and he connected the Union cause with Vesey’s thwarted revolt. But efforts to “remember Denmark Vesey” have faced opposition for 200 years, and even today some in Charleston actively—and sometimes violently—resist public recognition of his name."
