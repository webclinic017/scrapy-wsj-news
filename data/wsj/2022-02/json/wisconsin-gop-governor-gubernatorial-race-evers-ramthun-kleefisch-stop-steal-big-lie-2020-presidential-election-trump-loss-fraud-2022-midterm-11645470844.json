    "body": "Donald Trump’s delusions about the 2020 election are the gift that keeps on giving—to Democrats. “We don’t wear tinfoil hats,” says Wisconsin state Rep. Timothy Ramthun. Yet he is running for Governor while urging lawmakers to somehow “reclaim” the “fraudulent electoral ballots” that Wisconsin gave to President Biden.<br />Where to begin? There is no legal route for a state to undo the Electoral College votes cast in December 2020 and counted on Jan. 6, 2021. Zero, zip, zilch. Even if Mr. Trump had won Wisconsin’s 10 electors, he still would have lost the White House. Wisconsin Republicans have legitimate gripes about how voting rules were bent during the pandemic, including the use of ballot dropboxes and the private funds that flowed to local election offices."
