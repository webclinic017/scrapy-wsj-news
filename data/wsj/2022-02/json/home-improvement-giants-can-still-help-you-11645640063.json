    "body": "Home improvement retailers aren’t quite done improving.<br />Lowe’s Cos. Inc. on Wednesday said comparable sales grew 5% in the quarter ended Jan. 28 versus a year earlier, well above Wall Street expectations of 3%. Its earnings per share of $1.78 also exceeded estimates. That follows strong results at its larger peer,  Home Depot ,  which saw comparable sales grow 8.1% in its last quarter. So far there is no sign of a slowdown in demand for their wares, with Lowe’s seeing stronger year-over-year sales growth in February compared with January."
