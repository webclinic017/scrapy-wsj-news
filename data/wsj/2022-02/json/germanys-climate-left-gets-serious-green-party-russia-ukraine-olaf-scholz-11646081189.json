    "body": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday made energy a central plank in his overhaul of his country’s foreign policy. In response, leaders of the Green Party in his coalition government have offered the political left around the world a lesson in how to translate lofty ideals into responsible governance.<br />Germany’s overreliance on Russian oil and natural gas has long been a dangerous vulnerability, which Berlin can no longer ignore after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Scholz nodded to Berlin’s longstanding aim to shift entirely to renewable power sources by 2045, but he also promised to stockpile coal and gas reserves and build two new terminals to import liquefied natural gas from countries other than Russia."
