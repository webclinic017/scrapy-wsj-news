    "body": "House Republicans are crafting a modernized version of Newt Gingrich’s famous 1994 Contract With America. It’s a great idea for Republicans to draw a sharp contrast with the Biden agenda of trillions in new spending, higher tax rates on businesses, the reregulation of America, and the war on domestic energy. Voters want to know what Republicans are for.<br />At the top of this list of GOP legislative promises, along with school choice and a pro-growth energy strategy, should be to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was designed to spur investment, hiring and innovation—and it worked. Corporate tax rates fell from the highest in the world at 35% to 21%. Small business tax rates fell from roughly 40% to 32%. The average middle-income earner paid between $1,500 and $3,000 less in taxes."
