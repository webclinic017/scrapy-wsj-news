    "body": "Five Russian attack helicopters thundered over the modest house Lyudmyla and her husband Andriy, two doctors, built on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital, and opened fire on a nearby military airfield.<br />As Ukrainian forces fought back early afternoon, Lyudmyla and her 81-year-old father scurried into the cellar. “It’s a peaceful village.
