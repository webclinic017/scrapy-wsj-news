    "body": "New York has become the latest state to delay a mandate for healthcare workers to receive Covid-19 vaccine boosters after warnings that the rule would worsen existing staffing shortages at hospitals and nursing homes.<br />Health Commissioner Mary Bassett said Friday that officials wouldnâ€™t enforce the booster requirement that was set to take effect Monday. California and Connecticut recently pushed back their requirements for healthcare workers to be boosted to March 1 and March 7, respectively."
