    "body": "THE PANDEMIC era changed our relationship with clothes, denim included. Some women relegated jeans to the “hard pants” category, deeming them at odds with WFH comfort dressing. Others, like Rajni Lucienne Jacques, 39, the Brooklyn-based global head of fashion and beauty at Snapchat, evolved their denim habits to suit the times. She shifted from high-waist jeans to a roomy, 1990s wide-leg silhouette.<br />Call it a comfort hangover but as our lives return to something resembling normal, how jeans feel on our bodies is equally—if not more—important as how they look. “Today’s shapes are wider and looser, and mills have been working on new fiber blends that combine the authentic [jeans] look with softness…and drape,” said Amy Leverton, Los Angeles founder of trend-forecasting company Denim Dudes. That way, “we feel as comfortable on the dance floor as we were on our sofas.”"
