    "body": "Iran, the U.S. and other world powers are nearing a deal to revive the 2015 nuclear accord, although negotiators are still wrangling over significant final demands from Tehran, including the scope of sanctions relief.<br />An agreement could be finalized in Vienna within the next couple of days, said officials involved in the talks. President Biden has made restoring the agreement a top foreign-policy goal. The White House views an agreement restraining Iranâ€™s nuclear program as key to Middle East stability, allowing the U.S. to focus on China and Russia."
