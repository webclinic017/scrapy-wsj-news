    "body": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand—U.S. private-equity group Silver Lake has agreed to a scaled-down investment in commercial rights of the All Blacks, which values the New Zealand rugby team at about $2.3 billion.<br />Months of negotiations between Silver Lake, the governing body of New Zealand rugby and elite players have produced a deal that would still inject substantial cash into the sport in the country and give local financial institutions an opportunity to invest."
