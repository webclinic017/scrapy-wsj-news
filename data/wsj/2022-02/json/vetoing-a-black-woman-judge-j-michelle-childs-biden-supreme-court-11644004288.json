    "body": "A funny thing is happening on the way to President Biden’s first Supreme Court nomination. The opposition to one of the mooted black woman favorites is coming from the left, not the right. Whatever happened to diversity, as progressives try to disqualify Judge J. Michelle Childs?<br />Media outlets have carried stories full of progressive criticism about Judge Childs, a federal district court judge in South Carolina whom Mr. Biden has nominated to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. President Obama nominated Judge Childs to the district court bench, and the Senate confirmed her by a voice vote in 2010. Her confirmation hearing for the D.C. Circuit has been postponed."
