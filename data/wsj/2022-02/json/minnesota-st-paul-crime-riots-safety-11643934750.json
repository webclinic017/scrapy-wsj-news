    "body": "Regarding Lance Morrow’s “How Minnesota Went From Tom Sawyer to Huck Finn,” Cross Country, Jan. 22): When we moved to Woodbury, Minn., a suburb of St. Paul, 15 years ago, my husband would proudly tell people it was the “best place he ever lived.” But in the last couple of years especially, we no longer felt safe riding the light rail to Target Field to see Twins games; we stopped going into Minneapolis altogether after the riots; our accountant got mugged in downtown St. Paul; and the week we finally left the state, last summer, Woodbury had eight cars stolen out of driveways.<br />It’s a disgrace that these once-fine cities are now shells of their former selves. But locals keep voting in woke activists. It’s hard to see how the situation ends until more taxpayers vote with their feet and wallets."
