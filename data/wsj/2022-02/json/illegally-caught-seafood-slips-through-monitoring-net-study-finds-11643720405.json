    "body": "WASHINGTON—More than $2 billion worth of seafood caught in illegal or unregulated waters is finding its way to American dinner plates each year, evading the U.S. government’s import-monitoring system, according to a report released Tuesday.<br />The monitoring system, administered by the federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, covers 40% of the nation’s total imports of fish caught in the ocean. That allows imports of seafood products that contribute to overfishing or are mislabeled to consumers, according to the report by Oceana, an independent environmental group."
