    "body": "A federal judge said he would reject Sarah Palin’s allegations that she was defamed by the  New York Times ,  ruling that the former Republican vice-presidential candidate’s claims presented at trial were insufficient to prove her case.<br />U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff announced his decision Monday while jurors were still deliberating in the case. He said he would dismiss the claims after they return a verdict."
