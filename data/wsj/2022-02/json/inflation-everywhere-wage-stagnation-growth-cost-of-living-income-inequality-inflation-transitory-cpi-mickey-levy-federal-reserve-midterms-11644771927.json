    "body": "If you can believe it—and at this point you probably can—some people still say the sustained surge in prices across developed economies is transitory. As comforting as that thought might be for Democratic strategists panicking about November’s midterm election, a deeper dive into last week’s awful price data suggests it isn’t true.<br />The 7.5% increase in January on an annual basis is ominous enough. But the important fact is that the current inflation is nearly everywhere, including around the world. The United Kingdom’s central bank expects inflation to exceed 7% this spring and for inflation-adjusted living standards to decline by about 2% this year. Inflation in the eurozone hit 5.1% in January, prompting the perennially dovish European Central Bank to start contemplating an interest-rate increase this year."
