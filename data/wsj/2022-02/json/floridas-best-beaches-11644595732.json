    "body": "NORTHERN WINTERS reliably stoke a yearning for an escape to a tropical beach. But given the many Covid hurdles still in place for international travelers, the closer that beach is to home, the better. Little wonder then that Florida, with the longest coastline of any state in the contiguous U.S. and seasonably balmy temps, has had hotel occupancy rates among the highest in the country over the past few weeks, according to hotel-data company STR. Still, there are more than enough patches of sand to accommodate the influx of visitors, especially if you skip over the busy Florida Keys in favor of the Sunshine State’s lesser-known islands. Here, we focus on five distinctive isles, each home to beautiful beaches as well as other indisputable charms.<br />A 40-minute drive from Fort Myers, Sanibel is a lush, laid-back place with pretty, shell-strewn beaches and gentle surf that’s often punctuated by leaping dolphins. Visitors come for a window of welcome idleness, happily interrupted by little more than swimming (Tarpon Bay Beach is the star of the local strands) and beachcombing (Turner Beach is best for shelling; the prime times of the day are the hours before and after low tide)."
