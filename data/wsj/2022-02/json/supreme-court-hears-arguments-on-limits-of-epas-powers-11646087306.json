    "body": "WASHINGTON—A case over federal authority to limit greenhouse-gas emissions drew out sharply different principles at Supreme Court arguments Monday, with several conservative justices seeking broad rules to rein in regulatory power, while the liberal minority said the Environmental Protection Agency’s approach adequately accommodated industry needs.<br />Currently, no regulation limits greenhouse-gas emissions from power plants. Litigation tied up both a 2015 Obama-era initiative called the Clean Power Plan and a less-stringent Trump administration replacement, the Affordable Clean Energy Rule. The electric industry has managed nonetheless to meet EPA emissions targets by choosing to close coal-fired plants and replace them with cheaper gas and renewables."
