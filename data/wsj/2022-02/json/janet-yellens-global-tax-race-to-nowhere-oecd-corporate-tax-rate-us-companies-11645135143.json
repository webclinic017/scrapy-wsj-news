    "body": "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen pitches her global corporate-tax deal as the end of a “race to the bottom” on revenue collection. Odd, then, how U.S. companies keep finding that her plans amount to a race to the bottom of global competitiveness. Consider how corporate tax credits in the global deal could make America a big loser.<br />The mischief lurks in plans for a global minimum corporate tax of 15%, the so-called Pillar 2 of the two-pronged agenda negotiated at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. (The first pillar is an excess-profits tax aimed at tech and pharma companies.) The deal would allow governments to impose “top-up” taxes on companies operating in their jurisdiction if the company’s global effective tax rate falls below 15% as calculated in the company’s home country."
