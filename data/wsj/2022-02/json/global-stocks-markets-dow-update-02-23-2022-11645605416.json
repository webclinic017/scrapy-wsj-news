    "body": "U.S. stock futures and Treasury yields rose as investors assessed the latest developments in the Ukraine crisis, which has pushed the S&P 500 into correction territory.<br />Futures for the benchmark U.S. stock index rose 0.8% Wednesday, suggesting the gauge will claw back some lost ground when the market opens in New York. The S&P 500 fell for a third-straight day Tuesday after Russia deployed soldiers in Ukraineâ€™s Donbas region. The index is down more than 10% from the all-time closing high recorded on Jan. 3."
