    "body": "John Durham, famously tight-lipped, gave a rare speech at the University of St. Joseph in West Hartford, Conn., four years ago. The first words out of his mouth concerned the “awesome power” of prosecutors and the importance of proceeding in secret because sometimes the prosecutor’s suspicions about people are wrong.<br />When President Trump named Mr. Durham in 2018 to be U.S. attorney for Connecticut, so eager were the state’s two Democratic U.S. senators to take credit that they rushed out a statement noting Mr. Durham’s “immense respect as a no-nonsense, fierce and fair prosecutor.”"
