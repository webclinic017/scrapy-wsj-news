    "body": "This is no time for hair-splitting and half-measures. Vladimir Putin is invading Ukraine and denies that it is an independent, sovereign nation. The post-Cold War era is over. The West must adopt a new strategy to protect democracy in Europe. It won’t be easy.<br />In recent years, as both Republicans and Democrats abandoned hopes that China’s rise wouldn’t disrupt the U.S.-led economic and geopolitical order, a new consensus has developed: The U.S. must expand its alliances in the Indo-Pacific and strengthen its capacity to defend against Chinese aggression. Many hoped the U.S. could do this while sustaining the status quo in Europe. But this strategy presupposed that Russia would have neither the strength nor the will to disrupt the prevailing security order."
