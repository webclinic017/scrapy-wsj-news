    "body": "Former Vice President Mike Pence rejected former President Donald Trump’s repeated claims that Mr. Pence could have overturned the 2020 election outcome during the Jan. 6 special session of Congress, calling such a notion un-American.<br />“President Trump is wrong,” Mr. Pence said. “The presidency belongs to the American people and the American people alone. And frankly, there is no idea more un-American than the notion than any one person could choose the American president.”"
