    "body": "A backlog of thousands of renewable-energy projects are awaiting approval from the largest U.S. grid operator, a sign of the sector’s struggle to adapt to the rapid expansion of solar and wind power, participants in a WSJ Pro Sustainable Business event said.<br />Before project developers can connect new solar or wind farms to the grid, grid operators have to study the projects’ likely impact and sign off on them. PJM Interconnection LLC, which runs power infrastructure across 13 states and the District of Columbia, has a queue of projects to work through with a combined 225,000 megawatts of power capacity. It said this month it would give priority to 1,200 projects with around 100,000 megawatts—less than half of the backlog—leaving others uncertain about when they would be reviewed."
