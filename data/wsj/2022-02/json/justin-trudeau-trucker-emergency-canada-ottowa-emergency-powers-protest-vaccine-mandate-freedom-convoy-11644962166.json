    "body": "For Justin Trudeau, emergency powers are too often a policy of first resort. In March 2020, at the start of the pandemic, the Canadian prime minister sought arbitrary power to tax, spend and borrow for 21 months. He had already negotiated a Covid-relief package with the opposition, but he wanted a blank check. Now, as the pandemic seems to wind down, he has returned to the well.<br />Mr. Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act on Monday for the first time in Canadian history. (The law’s predecessor, the War Measures Act, was used only three times: World War I, World War II and the 1970 FLQ crisis involving Quebecois terrorists.) Now, in response to protests and blockades started by truckers against vaccine mandates, the prime minister has granted his government extraordinary temporary powers “to make orders or regulations that are believed, on reasonable grounds, to be necessary to respond to the issues at hand,” the Canadian government explains on its website."
