    "body": "Houston<br />At the risk of making a mighty overgeneralization: There’s an essential difference between the French and American versions of postwar modern art. The former is more Surrealist, more given to spiky elegance and Art-Deco-ish S-curves, and—not to put too fine a point on it—prettier. In Abstract Expressionism, for instance, we Americans have the raw, burnt-timberish black-and-white canvases of Franz Kline, while the French have the smoother, surer monochrome work of Pierre Soulages, not to mention the voilá elegance of Georges Mathieu. With Pop Art, it’s the American bluntness of Andy Warhol versus the artier Nouveau rêalisme of Martial Raysse. Minimalism, it seems, was entirely too plain-spoken for the French."
