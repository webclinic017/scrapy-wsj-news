    "body": "SOME PEOPLE associate long leather coats with alluringly mysterious men and the movie “The Matrix,” especially now that they’ve popped up in high-fashion collections by brands like Prada and Ralph Lauren Purple Label. Others think they’re downright sleazy, contending wearers look more like Mac from “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” than Morpheus. Here, two opposing positions.<br />Guys who encase themselves in long leather coats don’t care how anyone perceives them. You don’t wear a leather trench to fit in—you wear it to stand out. Consider David Murphey of Las Vegas, who’s trotted out his black Wilson Leather trench since he received it as a gift 20 years ago. When Mr. Murphey, 63, donned the coat on season 4 of the reality TV show “90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days,” which aired in 2020, fans took to social media to express their horror. Mr. Murphey was unbothered. In fact, he pointed out that such coats—now sold by Prada and Ralph Lauren, among other brands—were prevalent on runways during his season of the show. “I liked the way it looked,” he said. Mr. Murphey makes videos for Cameo, a service that allows anyone to order custom messages from celebrities, and said his coat is a draw. “Probably half of my Cameo requests also request me to put that coat on.”"
