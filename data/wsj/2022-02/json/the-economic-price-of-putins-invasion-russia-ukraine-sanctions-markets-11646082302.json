    "body": "Monday was a tense day for global markets as investors passed judgment on the sanctions many governments imposed on Russia over the weekend. The verdict so far: Western economies are resilient enough to absorb the pain. The Russian economy not so much.<br />In the West, the theme is “manageable pain.” European stock markets fell modestly on the day, by less than 1% in London and Frankfurt, and 1.4% in Paris. This was mirrored by declines of 0.24% for the S&P 500 index and 0.49% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average."
