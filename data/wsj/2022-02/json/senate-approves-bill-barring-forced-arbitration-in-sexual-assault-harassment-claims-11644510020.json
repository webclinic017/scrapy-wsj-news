    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Senate passed legislation Thursday barring companies from forcing employees into arbitration proceedings to address sexual-assault and harassment complaints, a significant change to workplace practices in the wake of the #MeToo movement.<br />The measure passed by voice vote, sending it to President Biden’s desk for his signature. The House passed its own version of the bipartisan legislation on Monday 335-97."
