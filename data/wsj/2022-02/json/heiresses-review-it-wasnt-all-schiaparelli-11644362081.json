    "body": "According to Laura Thompson, the essence of the heiress’s dilemma is: “How can she ever be sure that she is wanted for herself?” How can she avoid falling prey to a fortune-hunter as she yearns for love?<br />The poor little rich girl is a well-worn cliché. Two of the best-known 20th-century examples are the shipping heiress Christina Onassis and the Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton; between them they notched 11 husbands—mostly dodgy—plus sundry addictions before dying early wretched deaths. But as Ms. Thompson reveals in “Heiresses: The Lives of the Million Dollar Babies,” the predecessors of Onassis and Hutton often had a far worse time, with fewer legal protections."
