    "body": "The U.K. launched what it described as a first round of sanctions against Russian entities, while the European Union and the U.S. made plans to roll out their own measures later Tuesday—as all three capitals moved to collectively punish Moscow for sending troops into two breakaway provinces of Ukraine.<br />The restrictions announced so far, and expected in coming hours, fall short of many of the broader measures that officials said were being weighed should Russia outright invade its neighbor. But officials said Tuesday’s moves could be ratcheted up depending on whether Russian President Vladimir Putin escalates still further."
