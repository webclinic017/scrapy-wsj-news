    "body": "The trial of a former Los Angeles Angels communications executive accused of supplying the opioid painkillers that killed pitcher Tyler Skaggs has revealed another disturbing reality: that the use of such drugs on the Angels extended far beyond Skaggs, raising serious questions about their prevalence inside the game.<br />The 2019 death of Skaggs with oxycodone, fentanyl and alcohol in his system had already proved that Major League Baseball wasn’t immune to the opioid epidemic that has consumed the nation. Eric Kay, who was a communications executive with the team, has pleaded not guilty to charges of drug distribution and drug conspiracy."
