    "body": "A director resigned from the board of Sculptor Capital Management, alleging governance failures including “staggering” compensation awarded to the largest publicly traded U.S. hedge-fund firm’s CEO.<br />The allegations and resignation, detailed in a letter to the board Sculptor disclosed Thursday, have echoes of a past fight between firm founder Daniel S. Och and his onetime protégé, Chief Executive James Levin. Mr. Levin became CEO of the firm, formerly known as  Och-Ziff Capital Management ,  after a pitched succession battle in 2018 that led Mr. Och to step back."
