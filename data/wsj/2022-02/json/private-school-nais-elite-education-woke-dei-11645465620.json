    "body": "Andrew Gutmann and Paul Rossi’s op-ed “Inside the Woke Indoctrination Machine” (Feb. 12) exposes how the DEI agenda seeks 1. Diversity, by classifying people by identity, such as race; 2. Equity, by promoting victimhood arising from “intergenerational violence”; and 3. Inclusion, by viewing the world as biased, racist and oppressive. Any rational person can see that DEI really stands for division, exclusion and incitement.<br />Henry Scott"
