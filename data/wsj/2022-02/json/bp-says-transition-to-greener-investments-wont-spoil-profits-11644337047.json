    "body": "BP  PLC sought to reassure investors that declining oil-and-gas production won’t cripple earnings for the remainder of the decade as the British energy giant pivots to lower-carbon investments.<br />The reassurances came on a day when BP posted strong quarterly and annual earnings, following similar results in recent days by  Exxon Mobil Corp. ,  Chevron Corp.  and  Shell  PLC. The large Western oil companies are experiencing resurgent comebacks following sharp profit declines earlier in the pandemic, as supply constraints push the prices of crude and gas higher."
