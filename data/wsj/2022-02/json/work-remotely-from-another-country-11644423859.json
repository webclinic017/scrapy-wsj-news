    "body": "WHETHER YOU’RE a professional with part-time remote-work privileges or a full-time digital nomad, plenty of places and companies are eager to cater to your wanderlust.<br />If a shorter trip free from guesswork is all that time allows, then booking a longer stay at a hotel may be the path of least resistance even if it costs a bit more. Globally, many hotels have rolled out “workation” promotions which often include perks like massages and on-call IT support plus discounts on meals and laundry services. Others simply aim to captivate long-stay guests with complimentary nights. Two weeks at the Conrad Punta de Mita—near Puerto Vallarta—earns you a third week free. Avani Hotels & Resorts also offers rate reductions across many of its Asian locations including 10 free nights at its four-star Kalutara Resort in Sri Lanka when booking 30 days."
