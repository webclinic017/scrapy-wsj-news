    "body": "High levels of Covid-19 deaths hurt fourth-quarter results in  MetLife Inc.’s  business of providing employer-sponsored life insurance as the Delta variant persisted in the U.S., but the outsize payouts were more than offset by unusually strong investment gains.<br />The New York company’s net income soared to $1.18 billion, up from $124 million in the year-earlier period, when results were hurt by mark-to-market losses on financial hedges that aim to protect against falling interest rates. MetLife’s adjusted earnings, which analysts track as a measure of recurring profitability, were flat at $1.84 billion."
