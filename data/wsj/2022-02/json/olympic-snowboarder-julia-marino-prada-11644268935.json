    "body": "The most effective fashion campaign of the moment isn’t an ad at all in the traditional sense. It’s the image of 24-year-old Westport, Conn., snowboarder Julia Marino spinning through the air like a boomerang on her white-and-black board with its distinctive red Prada logo during the 2022 Beijing Olympics women’s slopestyle competition on Saturday. For her performance, Ms. Marino won the first U.S. Olympic medal of the games, a silver, while kitted out in a board, helmet and goggles by Prada Linea Rossa, one of her sponsors.<br />“I did not know Prada made snowboards,” said the Today Show’s Craig Melvin when interviewing Ms. Marino after her win. It’s a sentiment echoed by many folks on social media, who expressed surprise at seeing the luxury label advertised so prominently on a snowboard. The Italian brand, which is far better known for its luxe handbags and ready-to-wear collections than its sportswear, has nonetheless been making performance gear under the Linea Rossa name since 1997."
