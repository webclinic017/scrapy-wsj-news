    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Federal Reserve said it would test the ability of the largest U.S. banks to weather a hypothetical recession in which markets deteriorate markedly and unemployment jumps above 10%.<br />The so-called stress test, conducted annually to see how banks would react to drastic market and economic shocks, will feature a scenario in which a severe global recession leads to “heightened stress” in commercial real estate and corporate debt markets, the Fed said."
