    "body": "Kate Bachelder Odell’s op-ed “Fighter Pilots Need More Time in the Air” (Feb. 18) brings back many memories. In the late 1970s, I was an F-4E fighter pilot. Thanks to President Jimmy Carter and our Congress, the military budget had been cut severely. We were lucky to get 10 hours of flying every month. The typical airline pilot now flies about 60 to 70 hours a month.<br />We also had very few practice bombs and gun ammunition, so we did many “dry” attacks. That’s when you have no real bomb or bullets, so you pretend you dropped a bomb or shot the gun. You faked it. And so we faked our proficiency. It was like an NFL quarterback and his wide receivers practicing without a football. We just pretended to throw and catch the ball. Every pass was a touchdown!"
