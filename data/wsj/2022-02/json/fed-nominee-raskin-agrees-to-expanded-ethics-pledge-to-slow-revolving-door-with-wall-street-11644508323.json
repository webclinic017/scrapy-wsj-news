    "body": "WASHINGTON—Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Biden’s pick to become the Federal Reserve’s top banking regulator, said she would take added steps to assure lawmakers that she would avoid potential conflicts of interest.<br />An expanded ethics pledge, which comes at the request of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, is meant to slow what the Massachusetts Democrat has described as a revolving door of finance officials who go on to take powerful Washington jobs—or vice versa. Republicans have raised questions over a business arrangement Ms. Raskin struck after she last left the government in 2017."
