    "body": "MOST PEOPLE DON’T think about mayonnaise as much as Mason Hereford does. Most people certainly do not have a mayonnaise tattoo. But Mr. Hereford, who owns the beloved New Orleans sandwich joint Turkey and the Wolf, considers himself an adherent to the religion of mayonnaise. It is, he says, a faith with many gods—one of the most powerful of which is Kewpie.<br />Traditionally, Kewpie is used atop okonomiyaki (savory pancakes). Mr. Hereford’s forthcoming cookbook, “Turkey and the Wolf: Flavor Trippin’ in New Orleans” (Ten Speed Press), out in June, contains a recipe for what he calls okra-nomiyaki—roasted okra served with traditional okonomiyaki garnishes like seaweed and bonito flakes—with a zigzag of Kewpie on top. Those are excellent ideas. But Kewpie also adds oomph to tuna or egg salad. (The Los Angeles restaurant Konbi, which made its egg-salad sandwich an Instagram sensation, uses Kewpie.)  A few dots on top of grilled vegetables makes it much more fun to get your recommended daily allowance. Mr. Hereford particularly values Kewpie as a shortcut to all sorts of spreads and sauces: “You just chop stuff up and mix it in. With gravy, you actually have to cook.”"
