    "body": "The Internal Revenue Service has walked back the biometrics security program we wrote about last week, and we’re glad to hear it. But it’s still worth addressing the flawed arguments that led to this face plant.<br />Commissioner Chuck Rettig said Monday the IRS is scrapping a plan to require Americans to submit face scans to see their personal tax information. Democrats and Republicans blasted the plan on grounds of privacy, security and government intrusion, and Mr. Rettig now acknowledges that “everyone should feel comfortable with how their personal information is secured.”"
