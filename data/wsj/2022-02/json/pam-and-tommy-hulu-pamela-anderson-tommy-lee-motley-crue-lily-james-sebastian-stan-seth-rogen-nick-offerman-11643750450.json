    "body": "As moms always used to say, never leave the house without wearing clean underwear. (“What if you got in an accident?”) Today’s savvier mothers will include, “Don’t put anything in a text that you wouldn’t want on a billboard.” And those who followed the saga of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee circa 1997 might add, “Don’t have sex on camera if you don’t want it on the internet.”<br />The notorious mid-’90s sex tape that featured newlyweds Anderson and Lee—and kick-started the porn industry as it now exists on the web—might seem like the trashiest pretense imaginable for an eight-part miniseries. But to say that “Pam & Tommy” transcends its source material wouldn’t be giving it close to enough credit. It’s hard to think of an instance when a more talented group of actors—notably Lily James as the onetime “Baywatch” star and Sebastian Stan as her rock-star husband—portrayed such a morally dubious cast of characters. And made them, in the end, sympathetic."
