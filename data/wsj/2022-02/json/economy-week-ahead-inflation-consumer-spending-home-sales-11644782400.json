    "body": "The U.S. Commerce Department’s retail-sales report for January highlights this week’s slate of economic data.<br />Japan’s economy likely grew 1.4% from the previous quarter in the October-December period, according to a poll of economists by data provider Quick. Consumption recovered after Covid-19-related restrictions were lifted and supply-chain constraints in the auto industry eased. But economists expect the impact of the Omicron variant to slow growth in the current quarter."
