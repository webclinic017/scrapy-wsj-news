    "body": "A New York state judge ruled Thursday that Donald Trump and two of his adult children must testify under oath as part of the New York attorney generalâ€™s investigation into the former president and his company.<br />The ruling comes in a dispute over three civil subpoenas sent in December by the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James to Mr. Trump and two of his adult children, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr., as part of a probe into Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization. The subpoenas sought the testimony of all three Trumps, as well as documents from the elder Mr. Trump."
