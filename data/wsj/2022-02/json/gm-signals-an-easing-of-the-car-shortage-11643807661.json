    "body": "Getting your hands on a new car should become easier this year. The big question for both consumers and investors is at what price.<br />The most surprising projection made by  General Motors  when it reported fourth-quarter results after the bell on Tuesday was for growth of 25% to 30% this year in the number of vehicles it ships to dealers globally. In 2021, the semiconductor shortage held back GMâ€™s deliveries in the second half, so the expected jump would mostly make up for lost ground. It is still aggressive relative to the current industry consensus."
