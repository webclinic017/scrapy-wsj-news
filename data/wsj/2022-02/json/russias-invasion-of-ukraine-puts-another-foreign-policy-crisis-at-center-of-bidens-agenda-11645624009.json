    "body": "WASHINGTON—Since the chaotic withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan last year, President Biden has sought to steer his presidency toward domestic priorities, chiefly the coronavirus pandemic and the roaring inflation that has come with a strong economic recovery.<br />But with Russia’s movement of troops into the eastern Donbas region of Ukraine, Mr. Biden has a foreign-policy crisis back at the center of his agenda, testing his leadership on the world stage and among Americans split over the conflict and its potential costs. While Republican and Democratic leaders have expressed strong support for standing with Ukraine against Russian aggression, he has been pushed from both sides to take tough stances at times, while some in each party have also warned against the U.S. becoming too deeply involved in the crisis."
