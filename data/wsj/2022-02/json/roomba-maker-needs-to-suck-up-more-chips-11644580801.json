    "body": "Among the inequities of the great chip shortage is that even companies in similar industries aren’t being affected to the same extent.<br />Within personal and home electronics, the latest earnings season has seen relatively strong reports from companies including  Apple ,   Sonos  and  GoPro .  All three managed to exceed Wall Street’s revenue expectations for the December quarter, and both Apple and Sonos noted that sales would have been even higher if not for shortages of necessary components. The shares of all three got a lift following their respective reports; Sonos shares rose 4% Thursday following its fiscal first-quarter results."
