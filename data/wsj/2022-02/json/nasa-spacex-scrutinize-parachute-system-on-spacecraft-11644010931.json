    "body": "A parachute on a SpaceX cargo vehicle didn’t open as quickly as expected as the spacecraft descended from orbit last month, the second mission in a row for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in which the issue has emerged, officials said.<br />In late January, when a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft carrying cargo was returning to Earth from the International Space Station, one of the vehicle’s four main parachutes lagged behind the other three in deploying by about a minute, said Steve Stich, a NASA program manager."
