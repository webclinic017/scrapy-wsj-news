    "body": "Steve Hanke and Nicholas Hanlon’s op-ed “Powell Is Wrong. Printing Money Causes Inflation” (Feb. 24) presents a ridiculous argument about how money causes inflation based on the equation of exchange MV=PY. As opposed to a true equation, this relation is a mathematical identity. The authors’ “predicted” inflation simply rewrites the identity in terms of growth rates. “Predicted” inflation (P) is equal to the growth in money supply (M) and the growth in velocity (V), less the growth in real gross domestic product (Y).<br />I use quotation marks for “predicted” because these are not true predictions. They would be true predictions of the relation between money-supply growth and inflation only if they included a prediction for velocity. Otherwise, this remains a simple identity."
