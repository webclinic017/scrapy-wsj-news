    "body": "Uber Technologies Inc.  expects to be cash-flow positive by the end of this year, the companyâ€™s finance chief said as he outlined new bookings and earnings targets for investors Thursday.<br />If Uber meets that goal, it would mark the first time that the underlying business of the ride-hailing and delivery company generates more cash than it spends. Investors say a company with a lot of cash can better survive shocks and unexpected economic downturns, even if business slows and revenue and earnings suffer as they did during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic."
