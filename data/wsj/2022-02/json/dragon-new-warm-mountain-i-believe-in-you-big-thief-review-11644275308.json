    "body": "Big Thief leader Adrianne Lenker is seemingly writing new songs as fast as she can record them. We last heard from her country-rock band on record in 2019, when it released a pair of exceptional albums, “U.F.O.F.” and “Two Hands,” just a few months apart. During that creative burst, she and the group earned three Grammy nominations and spots high on many critics’ year-end lists, and they launched a tour through the U.S. and Europe that would be halted by the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />But Ms. Lenker is also a solo artist, and she released two albums that fall, “Songs” and “Instrumentals,” whose titles describe the content. About 15 months later, Big Thief returns with “Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You” (4AD), its fifth record, out Friday. This double album comprises 20 songs culled from what is said to be a batch of about 45."
