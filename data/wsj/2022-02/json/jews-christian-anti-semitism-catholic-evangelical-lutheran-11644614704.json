    "body": "While I appreciate Andrew Doran’s efforts to raise awareness of anti-Semitism, his argument that “Christians Need to Confront Anti-Semitism” (Houses of Worship, Feb. 4) is outdated and deflects from the real problem. The Catholic Church realized 60 years ago that it needed to confront anti-Semitism, and it did so in the Second Vatican Council. The church eliminated doctrines of deicide and supersessionism, while issuing formal apologies for Christianity’s role in centuries of persecutions.<br />Protestant denominations, especially Lutheranism, have confronted their histories of anti-Semitism, too. U.S. evangelicals may be the best example of the new warmth of feeling that has resulted. Extraordinary progress has been made in Christian-Jewish relations, so much so that the Christian community is now among the Jewish people’s best friends."
