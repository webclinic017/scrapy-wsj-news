    "body": "It has been a tough drive for car insurers lately, but changing driving habits might put a little fuel in their tank.<br />U.S. auto insurance companies have logged increases in the severity of claims, driven in large part by rising expenses for fixing and replacing cars due to a surging used-car market, snarled supply chains for parts and tight labor conditions. They also have only started to begin seeing increases in premium rates, since those need to pass through state regulatory approval."
