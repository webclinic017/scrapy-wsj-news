    "body": "Just when we thought Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene couldn’t get more embarrassing for the GOP, there she goes again. This weekend she and Rep. Paul Gosar addressed a rally organized by Nick Fuentes, a fringe internet figure who has a long record of praising a coming “tidal wave of white identity.”<br />Ms. Greene is now playing dumb, to choose a phrase. “I do not know Nick Fuentes,” she said. “I’ve never heard him speak. I’ve never seen a video. I don’t know what his views are, so I’m not aligned with anything that may be controversial.” But in the public mind she is aligned, since she accepted a laudatory introduction from Mr. Fuentes as his special “mystery speaker.”"
