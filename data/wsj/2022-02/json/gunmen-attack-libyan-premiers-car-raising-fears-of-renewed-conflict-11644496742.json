    "body": "Gunmen fired at the Libyan prime minister’s car early Thursday, raising tensions in the war-torn country as rival political factions wrangle for control over its interim government in a standoff that could unravel a United Nations-backed peace process.<br />At least one bullet hit the car’s windshield as Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah was returning home on a coastal road in the capital, Tripoli, according to Mohammed Ali Abdallah, Libya’s special envoy to the U.S. No one was hurt in the attack, he said."
