    "body": "A poison pill is clearly a tough one for  Kohl’s  activist investor Macellum to swallow.<br />Macellum on Thursday nominated a slate of 10 directors to Kohl’s board, which currently seats 14 members, including two that Macellum plus a group of investors had picked as part of a settlement with Kohl’s last year. The activist is eager to sell the company while interest still exists and its board-member selection seems optimized for such a process: At least four of the 10 board members Macellum nominated have investment-banking backgrounds."
