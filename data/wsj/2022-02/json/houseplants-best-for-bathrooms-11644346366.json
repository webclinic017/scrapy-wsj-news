    "body": "PLANTS ARE already a go-to decorating tool. Whether it’s an erupting schefflera that offsets a boxy sofa or an ivy that softens the doldrums of a desk, they bring a much-needed living element to décor. So why not extend that soul-soothing effect by adding foliage to a bathroom, a habitat particularly hospitable to flora? “The humidity [of the bathroom] makes it the most greenhouse-like portion of a home,” said Christopher Satch, professor at the New York Botanical Garden and a scientist with Horti, a houseplant subscription service based in Brooklyn. Well-suited to thrive in a loo are tropical plants known as epiphytes—orchids, ferns and air plants among them—that in the forest grow within the tree canopy. Unlike terrestrial types, such as a spider plant, these gather nutrients and drink up the water droplets from the air.<br />Though humidity suits these species, plants have no place in the shower, say experts, lest they be inadvertently overwatered. What’s more, errant shampoo and soap suds can strip leaves of their protective waxy layer."
