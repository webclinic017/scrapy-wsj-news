    "body": "Vietnam factory shutdowns and supply chain snags notwithstanding, apparel companies emerged from the pandemic looking sharp. How long can they keep it up?<br />Their momentum seems intact following reports of healthier-than-expected revenue and profits. Ralph Lauren saw its sales grow by more than a quarter compared with a year earlier in the three months ended Dec. 25. Its operating margin, at 15.9%, was the highest seen in a comparable quarter since 2013.  Capri Holdings ,  which owns Michael Kors, Versace and Jimmy Choo, saw revenue up 24% compared with a year earlier in its last quarter and saw operating margins expand by 6 percentage points. Levi’s and PVH, owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, likewise saw healthy margin expansions in their latest quarters compared with both 2020 and 2019."
