    "body": "Catholic schools have educated millions of Americans, and their decline in recent decades has been a cultural and educational tragedy. But crisis creates opportunity, and the news is that Catholic schools staged a surprising enrollment rebound during the pandemic. Imagine that: Stay open to teach children, and they will come.<br />The National Catholic Educational Association reports that enrollment in U.S. Catholic schools increased by 62,000 students—3.8%—from fall 2020 to fall 2021. That’s the highest one-year increase the organization has recorded and the first enrollment upswing in two decades."
