    "body": "<br />One of the problems Ukrainians are facing today is what would happen to the country’s cultural heritage after a massive invasion, something Ukraine’s curators already know a lot about. In 2014, during the Russian annexation of Crimea and the war started by Russian proxies in Donetsk and Luhansk, Ukraine lost dozens of archaeological, historical and art collections. In November of that year, the Donetsk Regional Museum of Local History was hit 15 times by antitank missiles and about 30% of its 150,000-object collection was destroyed."
