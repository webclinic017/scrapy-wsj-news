    "body": "The music business has done quite well in the pandemic despite having one arm tied behind its back. Investors are betting big that this is a breakout year for live performances.<br />Recorded-music revenue is at its highest point in more than a decade, but the global Covid-19 outbreak in early 2020 froze the live concert business and the chill persisted through most of last year as well. Industry tracking company Pollstar estimates that the top 100 musical acts sold just 19 million tickets in 2021. That was up 42% from 2020’s meager numbers, but was less than half the 56 million tickets sold annually by the top 100 acts on average from 2015 to 2019. The shifting public-health situation, with the Delta and Omicron variants sparking fresh outbreaks in the summer and late fall, respectively, didn’t help a business that depends on its ability to pack thousands of screaming fans into some tight places."
