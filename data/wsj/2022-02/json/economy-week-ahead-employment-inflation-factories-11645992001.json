    "body": "The U.S. employment report highlights this week’s calendar of regularly scheduled economic news. The official reports won’t yet reflect fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which in addition to the human toll threatens higher energy prices and a broader supply shock.<br />China’s factory sector got off to a sluggish start this year as Covid-19 flare-ups disrupted activity and slowed consumer spending. Economists expect the country’s official purchasing managers index for the manufacturing sector to worsen in February because of Lunar New Year holiday disruptions and weakened external demand. That would take the PMI below the 50 mark that separates contraction from expansion."
