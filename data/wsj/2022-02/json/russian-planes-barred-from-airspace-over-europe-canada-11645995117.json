    "body": "The European Union and Canada on Sunday said they would bar Russian planes from entering their airspace, joining other countries in choking off Russiaâ€™s access to global aviation routes in response to its invasion of Ukraine.<br />The EU announced the step amid a host of other actions, including financing the purchase and delivery of weapons in a show of support for Ukraine. In closing its airspace, the EU banned not only commercial airliners but any plane owned, registered or controlled by Russians, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said."
