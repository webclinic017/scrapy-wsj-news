    "body": "Plans by companies to sell stakes in juicy noncore assets have a reputation for being shareholder-friendly. But pleasing investors isn’t chiefly what  Volkswagen ’s  potential initial public offering of Porsche is about.<br />VW on Tuesday confirmed long-rumored talks with its majority shareholder,  Porsche  SE, about an IPO of its sports-car brand, Porsche AG. Porsche SE is an investment fund that consists of little more than its controlling VW stake. It used to own its namesake manufacturer but lost direct control during the infamous 2008 short squeeze that briefly made VW the world’s most valuable company. Porsche SE has made clear it would like the brand back."
