    "body": "Sen. Ben Sasse (R., Neb.) introduced a bill on Feb. 2 to ban members of Congress from buying or selling individual shares of stocks. The move came amidst controversy surrounding stock trades by lawmakers and scandals involving trades made by Federal Reserve regional bank presidents and Federal Reserve Board members.<br />House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has eyed similar legislation that would ban lawmakers from trading individual stocks. Even Speaker Nancy Pelosi, while defending her own controversial stock trading, said she would be open to advancing such legislation. “It has to be governmentwide,” she told reporters on Wednesday."
