    "body": "The White House Correspondents’ Association gala, once one of the top events on Washington’s social calendar, is returning for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic began.<br />Typically an annual event which last took place in 2019, the dinner celebrates the White House press corps and the presidency, giving out awards and offering scholarships for aspiring journalists. It is often attended by the president and first lady and has drawn a sizable Hollywood contingent. Former President Donald Trump shunned it during his four years in office, which often involved a contentious relationship with the press."
