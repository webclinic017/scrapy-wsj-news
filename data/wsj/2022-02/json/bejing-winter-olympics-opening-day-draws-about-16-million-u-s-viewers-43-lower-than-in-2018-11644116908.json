    "body": "The opening day of the Winter Olympics in Beijing drew nearly 16 million viewers in the U.S. on Friday across NBC’s TV and streaming platforms, a roughly 43% drop from the kickoff for the Games in Pyeongchang in 2018, according to preliminary figures from the network.<br />The opening ceremony aired twice on Friday—live in the morning and again in prime time, on both NBC and streaming service Peacock. Beijing is 13 hours ahead of the U.S. East Coast. NBC’s viewership ratings, which includes figures from Nielsen and Adobe Analytics, cover all of the TV broadcasts and streaming."
