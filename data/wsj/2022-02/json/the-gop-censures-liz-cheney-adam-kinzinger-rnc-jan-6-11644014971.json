    "body": "The polls suggest the GOP is in remarkably good position for November’s elections, but never underestimate the party’s ability to blow it. On Friday the Republican National Committee censured Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, citing their roles in the House inquiry into the Capitol riot of Jan. 6, 2021. The RNC pledged to “immediately cease any and all support of them.”<br />This kind of ritual purification is bad politics. Republicans should be talking about President Biden’s $5 trillion spending plan, 7% inflation, and the Americans who are still trying to flee Afghanistan. Now the media is crowing because the RNC says Ms. Cheney and Mr. Kinzinger’s role in investigating Jan. 6 amounts to “persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse.”"
