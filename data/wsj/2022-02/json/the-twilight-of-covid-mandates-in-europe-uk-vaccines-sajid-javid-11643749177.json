    "body": "The Biden Administration isnâ€™t the only government rethinking Covid vaccine mandates. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration quietly dropped its mandate after a rebuke from the Supreme Court, and some leaders in Europe are also finally getting serious about learning to live with the virus.<br />United Kingdom Health Secretary Sajid Javid on Monday scrapped a requirement for employees of the National Health Service (NHS) to be vaccinated by April. Doctors, nurses and other staff would have had to receive their first shots this week to be fully vaccinated in time and it became clear tens of thousands were holding out, amounting to more than 5% of the NHS work force. This amid chronic staff shortages."
