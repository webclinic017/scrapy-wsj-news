    "body": "Cisco Systems Inc.  needs to beef up its software business. There is no better time.<br />The Wall Street Journal reported late Friday that Cisco recently made an offer to acquire security and business intelligence software provider  Splunk  for more than $20 billion. The two companies apparently aren’t in active talks now, so it is far from assured that a deal will get done. But that price would represent a premium of at least 10% to Splunk’s last closing value, making it three times the size of Cisco’s largest deal to date. Splunk shares rose more than 9% Monday, while Cisco’s slipped by more than 1%."
