    "body": "Vladimir Putin’s decision to drop bombs on Kyiv last week sent shock waves through Europe and the U.S., as intended. But at home, things aren’t going so well for the little dictator with big ambitions.<br />Among other things, Mr. Putin’s aggression with his neighbors has sparked a renewed Russian outcry against corruption that is gaining world attention. Perhaps it can help Igor Bitkov, his wife, Irina, and their daughter, Anastasia, who more than a decade after escaping the dictator’s grip in Russia remain in legal limbo in Guatemala."
