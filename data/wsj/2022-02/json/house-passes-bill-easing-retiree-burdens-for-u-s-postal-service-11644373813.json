    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House passed legislation designed to keep the U.S. Postal Service financially viable, including by repealing a requirement that it prefund retiree health benefits, sending the measure to the Senate where it also has broad support.<br />The measure passed the House by a lopsided 342-92, showing the bipartisan backing for a bill that has been more than a decade in the making. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) issued a statement immediately after the vote saying that his chamber would take up the measure soon."
