    "body": "A year ago, with Covid-19 cases falling and vaccines getting rolled out, the U.S. economy entered a remarkable period of recovery. The boost to the economy that comes with the fading of the Omicron wave could be even more pronounced.<br />Over the week ended Wednesday, there was an average of 215,418 newly confirmed Covid-19 cases each day in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That is 73% below the daily average peak of 806,107 registered in the middle of last month. And it isn’t just the U.S. where cases are falling—they are dropping sharply across the world, from the U.K. to Brazil to India."
