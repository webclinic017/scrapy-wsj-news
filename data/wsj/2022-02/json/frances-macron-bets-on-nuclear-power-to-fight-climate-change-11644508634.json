    "body": "PARIS—French President Emmanuel Macron announced a plan to build six new nuclear reactors, betting on a technology that produces electricity with almost zero greenhouse gas emissions but faces questions about the high cost of new projects.<br />As part of the plan, Electricite de France SA, the country’s state-controlled power company, reached a deal to buy part of the nuclear steam turbine business of General Electric Co., including several factories in France. The two sides didn’t disclose a price."
