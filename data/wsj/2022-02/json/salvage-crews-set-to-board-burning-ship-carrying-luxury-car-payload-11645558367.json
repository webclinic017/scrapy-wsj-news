    "body": "The blaze aboard the Felicity Ace, a 60,000-ton merchant ship loaded with luxury cars adrift in the Atlantic, is receding, which could allow the company charged with salvaging the ship to board it on Wednesday and stop it from drifting further out to sea, a Portuguese navy official said.<br />The Felicity Ace was traveling from Emden, Germany to a port in Davisville, R.I., when it caught fire a week ago as it sailed near Portugalâ€™s Azores Islands. The 22-member crew abandoned the ship and its cargo of around 4,000 expensive luxury cars, including models from Porsche, Bentley, Audi, Lamborghini and other  Volkswagen AG  brands."
