    "body": "Reginald Lewis was the first black businessman to pull off a billion-dollar leveraged buyout. He ran the largest black-owned U.S. company, the first to generate sales of more than a billion dollars a year. A building at Harvard Law School, his alma mater, is the Reginald FB. Lewis International Law Center.<br />Yet today the public hardly knows his name, and that’s a shame. Lewis broke racial barriers. Ken Frazier, executive chairman of Merck, said, “Reg Lewis opened up a world of possibilities for an entire generation of black business leaders.” Financier and philanthropist Michael Milken called Lewis “the Jackie Robinson of American business.”"
