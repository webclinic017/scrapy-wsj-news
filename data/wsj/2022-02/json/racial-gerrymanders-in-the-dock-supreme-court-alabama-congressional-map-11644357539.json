    "body": "The Supreme Court isn’t above criticism, heaven knows, but it would be nice if the critics didn’t accuse the Court of judgments it hasn’t made. A case in point is the hyperventilating over the Court’s 5-4 ruling Monday that stayed a lower-court order requiring Alabama’s Congressional map to be redrawn in a few weeks (Merrill v. Milligan). The ruling did not rewrite the Voting Rights Act.<br />Section 2 of the VRA bars voting practices or procedures that discriminate by race. This seems clear enough: Don’t racially gerrymander. The Court, however, interpreted Section 2 in Thornburg v. Gingles (1986) to essentially require legislatures to maximize majority-minority districts. In a Catch 22, later Court decisions have forbidden legislatures from weighing race too heavily in redistricting."
