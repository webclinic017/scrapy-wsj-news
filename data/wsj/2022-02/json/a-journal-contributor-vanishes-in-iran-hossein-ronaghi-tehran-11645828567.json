The Iranian blogger and free-speech activist Hossein Ronaghi, who has contributed to these pages, has disappeared and is probably under arrest in Tehran.<br />Iran is pushing legislation to give authorities vast new control of the internet. Mr. Ronaghi has publicly opposed this takeover. “The aim of this plan is to shut down the internet and follow the Chinese model of limited national intranet,” he tweeted on Tuesday."
