    "body": "Jean-Paul Sartre said hell is other people. For me, it is being on a long flight without something good to read. Some years back, I realized my predicament moments before boarding a plane in London. This gave me just enough time to make an emergency purchase at an airport bookstore.<br />For me, ebooks donâ€™t count. Reading is intimate, both in the feeling of crisp pages between my fingers and in forsaking all others for the text chosen. On a plane, books are also social; they inspire good conversation."
