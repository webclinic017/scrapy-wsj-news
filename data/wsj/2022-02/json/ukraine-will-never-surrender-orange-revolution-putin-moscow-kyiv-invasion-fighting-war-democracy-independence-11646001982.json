    "body": "These are black days for Ukraine. But there was a time, not long ago, when the country was defined by a brighter color. In 2004 and 2005, the Orange Revolution stopped a Russian crony from stealing a presidential election. The spirit of patriotism and pride I saw then is still there now, as Russia invades.<br />As a 17-year-old Christian missionary, I arrived in Kyiv in spring 2005. A host family took my parents and me straight to Maidan, the square in the heart of the city center. It was dotted with orange flags and signs emblazoned with a single word: “Tak,” Ukrainian for “yes.”"
