    "body": "Real-estate agents typically are paid a standard commission for helping sell or buy a home. But should they be compensated differently?<br />In the U.S., the seller typically pays both the listing agent and the buying agent, and each of them usually receives about 3% of the transaction cost. That means a house with a $600,000 sale price would carry a total 6% commission of $36,000."
