    "body": "Few shows on television today ignite more generational anxiety than “Euphoria,” the high-school drama currently in its second season on HBO. Since the series debuted in 2019, multiple articles have referred to it as a “parents’ worst nightmare” for its graphic scenes of drug use, sex and violence. The conservative Parents Television Council has issued warnings about the show’s content and is gathering signatures for a petition against it. The Drug Abuse Resistance Education program, or D.A.R.E., recently released a statement saying that “Euphoria” glorifies destructive behavior. Many people I know, especially parents, find the show too extreme to watch, whether they see it as stark reality or frightening fantasy.<br />Others are able to look past the graphic nature of “Euphoria” to find aesthetic inspiration. And it’s not just teenagers discovering poetry in the series’s inventive, color-saturated universe. As its costume designer Heidi Bivens, whose work on the show has earned her two Emmy nominations, told me, “It’s not for kids.” The show’s look—sparkling makeup, skater comfort and revealing, early 2000s-ish outfits—is smack in the middle of the zeitgeist right now. Even adults with mortgages and 9-to-5 jobs are dressing like they attend the fictional East Highland High School."
