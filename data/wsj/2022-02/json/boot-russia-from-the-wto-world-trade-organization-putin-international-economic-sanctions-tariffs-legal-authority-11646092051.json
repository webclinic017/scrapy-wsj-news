    "body": "Expulsion of the Russian Federation from the World Trade Organization should be on the list of economic sanctions used to punish Vladimir Putin. The invasion of Ukraine has proved beyond doubt that the current Russian government is no longer fit to be part of an international commercial organization committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes.<br />No specific WTO provision relates to expelling a member. Expulsion would be possible under Article X of the WTO agreement, however, if two-thirds of the WTOâ€™s current 164 members vote to alter the agreement. If Russia were to refuse to accept the changes, then a three-fourths vote could expel the Russian federation."
