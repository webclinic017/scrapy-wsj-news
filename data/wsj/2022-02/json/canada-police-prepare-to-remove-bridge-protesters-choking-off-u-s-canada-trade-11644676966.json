    "body": "Efforts by Canadian police to clear protesters blocking traffic on a crucial bridge between the U.S. and Canada appear to have stalled Saturday, as an initial crowd of roughly 50 people swelled to over 500 as of early afternoon, among them parents with children.<br />A row of police officers, standing side-by-side across a six-lane road, succeeded in moving protesters away from the entrance to the Ambassador Bridge, opening some corridors toward the bridge. However, there was still no traffic either northbound or southbound on the bridge as of early afternoon."
