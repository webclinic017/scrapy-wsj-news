    "body": "I LIVE IN A QUIET neighborhood next to a racetrack. At night the local delinquents use the expressways to test and tune their rashly overbuilt heaters—peeling out, snatching upshifts and bawling into the night. I was once like them but then I turned 9.<br />I hear a lot of late-model  Ford  Mustangs out there. The Ford 5.0-liter Coyote V8 has a distinctive timbre: not a dry, drumlike rapping; more like the way SWAT teams knock on doors. My neighbor once asked me when does it end? I said about 7,000 rpm."
