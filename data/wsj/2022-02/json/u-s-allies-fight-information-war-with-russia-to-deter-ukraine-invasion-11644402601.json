    "body": "Russian troops are poised near Ukraine’s borders and U.S. officials warn that an invasion could come any day. But an information war between Moscow and the West has been under way for months.<br />In a break with past practices, the U.S. and British governments have repeatedly stated they have secret intelligence warning that Russia is preparing to invade Ukraine.
