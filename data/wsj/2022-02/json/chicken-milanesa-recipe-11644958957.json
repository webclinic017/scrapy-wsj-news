    "body": "SANDWICHES ARE something of a specialty for Philadelphia chef Cristina Martinez. For a time in her native Mexico, she sold hand-held meals like this torta milanesa along with fresh-pressed juices out of her mother’s kitchen.<br />In Ms. Martinez’s final Slow Food Fast recipe, the centerpiece is the chicken milanesa, a cutlet pounded thin, breaded and fried to a crisp golden brown. Served on a roll slathered in mayonnaise and refried beans, with toppings of avocado, tomato and shredded lettuce, it hits all the marks: salty, crunchy, fresh, creamy. A garnish of pickled jalapeños isn’t mandatory, but it does add a great kick."
