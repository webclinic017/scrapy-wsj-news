    "body": "Joe Montana was my childhood hero. The NFL quarterback remains the person who, more than any other, shaped who I wanted to be.<br />As this year’s Super Bowl approaches, I’ve been thinking about him and the prevailing idea that it’s vitally important for children to be able to picture themselves among those in positions of power and influence. The concept is that when kids turn their eyes to the Supreme Court or the International Space Station, they should see someone who “looks like them” and shares their “lived experience.”"
