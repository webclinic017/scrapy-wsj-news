    "body": "The U.S. Constitution doesn’t allow states to invent qualifications for serving in Congress and exclude candidates from the ballot for failing to meet them. Yet that is precisely what the North Carolina State Board of Elections is trying to do to Rep. Madison Cawthorn.<br />Mr. Cawthorn, who was elected in 2020, attended President Trump’s rally in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021. Mr. Cawthorn offered acerbic rhetoric ahead of and during the rally, falsely casting doubt on the election result and using the word “fight” when addressing the audience. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called the riot that ensued at the Capitol a “failed insurrection.”"
