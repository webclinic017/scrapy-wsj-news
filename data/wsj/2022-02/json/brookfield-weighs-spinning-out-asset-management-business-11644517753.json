    "body": "Brookfield Asset Management Inc.  is weighing a plan to spin out its asset-management business, with Chief Executive Bruce Flatt saying the operation could be worth as much as $100 billion.<br />Many investors prefer fund managers to be “asset light,” Mr. Flatt said in a letter to shareholders Thursday, while Brookfield is seen as “asset heavy,” partly because it has $50 billion of its own investment capital."
