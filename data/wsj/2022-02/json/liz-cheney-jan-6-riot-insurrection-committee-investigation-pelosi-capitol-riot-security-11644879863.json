    "body": "Rep. Liz Cheney writes that those who wish to conceal the truth of Jan. 6, 2021, have called the congressional investigation “tainted and political” (“The Jan. 6 Committee Won’t Be Intimidated,” Feb. 11). Her writing does not help combat this perception.<br />She pledges, “Our hearings will show that [President Trump’s election] falsehoods provoked the violence on Jan. 6.” This conclusion is made prior to finishing the investigation. Even Robert Mueller waited until after the full investigation to draw conclusions and publish his report."
