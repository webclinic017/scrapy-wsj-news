    "body": "Two court decisions Wednesday on the redrawing of congressional districts aren’t likely to give either party a major advantage in the coming midterm elections. They came in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, where partisans have been fighting for months over the once-a-decade redistricting process.<br />Of the North Carolina decision, Michael Li, senior counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, said: “Compared to the current map, it’s a little bit more Democratic” but North Carolina is a battleground state, and the new map reflects that competitiveness."
