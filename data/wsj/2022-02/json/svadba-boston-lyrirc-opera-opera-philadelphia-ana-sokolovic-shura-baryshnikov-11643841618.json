    "body": "<br />One of the most interesting creative developments resulting from the Covid-19 shutdown of live performance is the recognition that operas can work as films. Rather than the familiar video representations of staged performances, these projects are conceived for the screen, expanding the visual environments of the stories and even divorcing the physical process of singing from the characters on the screen. Boston Lyric Opera and Opera Philadelphia have pioneered individually in filmed opera; their collaboration on a film of Ana Sokolović’s “Svadba” (2011) is now available to subscribers on the digital channels of both companies at operabox.tv and operaphila.tv; on-demand viewing is $15."
