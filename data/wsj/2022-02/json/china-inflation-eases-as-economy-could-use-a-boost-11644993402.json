    "body": "HONG KONG—Inflationary pressure in China continued to ease in January, offering room for Beijing to stimulate growth while more major economies are looking to tighten policy to curb rising prices.<br />The producer-price index, a gauge of wholesale prices charged by manufacturers, rose a lower-than-expected 9.1% from a year earlier, down from December’s 10.3%, National Bureau of Statistics data published on Wednesday show. Softening coal and steel prices helped lead the index lower, said Dong Lijuan, a senior statistician with the bureau."
