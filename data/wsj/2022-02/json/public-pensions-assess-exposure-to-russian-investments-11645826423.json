    "body": "A number of U.S. public pensions are assessing their portfolios for exposures across public and private investments in Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, as the potential for pressure to divest of such assets starts to grow.<br />A small number of state legislators, including ones in New Jersey and Illinois, plan to introduce regulation that would require their state pension funds to divest from Russia. Meanwhile, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, issued an executive order that directs state agencies, including the stateâ€™s pension system, to terminate contracts involving Russian state-owned companies as contractors or subcontractors."
