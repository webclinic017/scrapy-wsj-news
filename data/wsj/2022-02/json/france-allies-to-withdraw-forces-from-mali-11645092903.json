    "body": "PARIS—France and its European allies said they would withdraw their military forces from Mali, a move that threatens to leave a security vacuum in Africa’s Sahel region where French-led troops have spent nearly a decade battling Islamist terrorist groups and tamping down ethnic conflict.<br />The decision comes after months of deteriorating relations between the West and Mali’s rulers, who took over the West African nation in a coup backed by the military in May last year. The Malian government has since hired Russian private-security firm Wagner Group, prompting Europe to impose sanctions on the coup leaders. France has suspended much of its financial support for the impoverished nation to stop those funds from being used to pay Wagner an estimated $10 million a month."
