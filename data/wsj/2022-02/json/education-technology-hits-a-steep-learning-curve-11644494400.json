    "body": "An investment in knowledge pays the best interest, said the man whose face graces the $100 bill. So far, that hasn’t been the case for investors in education technology companies.<br />Chegg ,  the seller of a $19.95-a-month study pack subscription for college students, saw its market capitalization cut in half in November after it reported a surprising drop in subscriber numbers during the third quarter. Subscriber numbers quickly rebounded—Chegg’s executives think Covid fatigue prompted students to postpone coursework—but its shares haven’t, down by two-thirds compared with a year earlier. Online course platforms Coursera and  Udemy  are down 51% and 42%, respectively, since their market debuts in 2021."
