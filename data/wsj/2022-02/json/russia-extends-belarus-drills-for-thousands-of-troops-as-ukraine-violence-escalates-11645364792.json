    "body": "Russia will extend its military drills with Belarus involving some 30,000 troops near Ukraine’s border, the government in Minsk said, citing an uptick in violence in eastern Ukraine as Moscow’s standoff with the West over the future of Eastern Europe deepens.<br />The exercises had been scheduled to wind down this weekend, but Belarus said Sunday they would continue indefinitely after Russian-backed forces accused Ukraine of shelling civilian areas in territories they control. Western officials have backed Kyiv’s assertion that the claims are part of an operation aimed at providing a pretext for a Russian-led attack."
