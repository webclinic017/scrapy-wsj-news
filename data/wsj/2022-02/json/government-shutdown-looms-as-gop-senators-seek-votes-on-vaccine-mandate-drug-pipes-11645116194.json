    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Democratic leaders continued working Thursday to pass a stopgap bill keeping the government funded beyond Friday, hoping to persuade Republicans to reach a deal quickly so lawmakers headed to an overseas security conference could make their afternoon flights.<br />Republicans including Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Mike Lee of Utah are pushing for votes related to topics from drug pipes to vaccine mandates. They can’t stop a government spending bill from passing because the measure is widely supported, but they can slow down the process by refusing to cut short the debate time that is required before most votes unless all senators agree to waive it."
