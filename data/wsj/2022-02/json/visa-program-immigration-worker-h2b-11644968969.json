    "body": "Regarding your editorial “The U.S. Legal Immigration Shortage” (Feb. 8): When local help-wanted ads go unfilled, the federal H-2B visa program provides access to temporary seasonal labor for small and seasonal businesses. The effects are broad—the visa program benefits workers, consumers and local economies. As the editorial board correctly highlights, however, the program is plagued by chronic oversubscription, which causes perennial worker shortages. Fortunately, we have the solution. It is bipartisan and has already passed Congress once before.<br />We are offering the Returning Worker Exception Act to solve this chronic issue. As the name suggests, it would create an exception allowing certain previously approved guest workers to obtain another temporary work visa without counting against the annual cap (which is currently set at 66,000). The bill will also strengthen the program’s integrity by enhancing regulatory enforcement, increasing penalties for systemic abuse, ensuring U.S. worker protections and establishing fair treatment and conditions for guest workers."
