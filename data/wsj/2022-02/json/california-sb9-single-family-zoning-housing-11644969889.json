    "body": "Edwin Pinto and Tobias Peter believe legislation known as SB9 is “California’s Free-Market Housing Fix” (op-ed, Feb. 4) that will “restore some private property rights taken away by zoning restrictions.” Few, if any, feel that any rights have been taken away, and most property owners in single-family-zoned areas see the zoning “restriction” as an asset, and do not endorse SB9. It is a threat to the security and community demographics that attracted them.<br />There is nothing free market about California’s approach, as it is simply another government attempt to create an economy and population demographic of its own design. By omitting any mention of SB9’s impacts on traffic, schools, retail services and crime in these areas, it becomes clear that the “benefits” of SB9 will not accrue to the current property owners, and that there is more to SB9 than Messrs. Pinto and Peter would care to reveal."
