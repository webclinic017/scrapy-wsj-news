    "body": "SYDNEY—SpaceX, the space-exploration company founded by Elon Musk, is seeking to establish a communications bridge to Tonga after last month’s volcanic eruption and tsunami largely cut the Pacific nation off from the outside world, a senior Fijian lawmaker said.<br />The disaster on Jan. 15 killed three people and severed Tonga’s undersea cable that provides high-speed internet via Fiji. The eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano also deposited a carpet of material up to 1.2 inches deep across the Pacific archipelago of some 170 islands."
