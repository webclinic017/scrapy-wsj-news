A Turkish-made drone launched a missile and knocked out a Russian-supplied howitzer.<br />This demonstration of force—the first drone strike in combat by Ukraine’s military—unnerved Russia and fueled complaints from Moscow that North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries including Turkey, the U.S. and Britain were threatening Russia’s security by supplying sophisticated new weapons to Kyiv."
