    "body": "Even the most obvious corporate mergers may not fly in today’s antitrust climate.<br />On Monday, the top two ultralow-cost airlines in the U.S.,  Spirit Airlines  and  Frontier Group Holdings ,  said they are combining in a cash-and-stock deal. The merger would create the fifth-largest airline in the U.S. in terms of seats, data from Cirium’s Diio Mi show. Their fleets, together comprising more than 280 jets, would be extremely easy to combine since they are both made up of models from the Airbus A320 family."
