    "body": "LONDON—Queen Elizabeth II has resolved a question hanging over her succession, stating that Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, should be referred to as queen once Prince Charles accedes the throne.<br />In a message to mark her 70 years on the throne, Queen Elizabeth on Saturday—the eve of her accession—said it was her “sincere wish that, when that time comes” her eldest son’s wife take the title “Queen Consort.”  Queen Consort refers to the spouse of a ruling king. As a result, the Duchess of Cornwall would be referred to as “Queen Camilla” if her husband comes to the throne."
