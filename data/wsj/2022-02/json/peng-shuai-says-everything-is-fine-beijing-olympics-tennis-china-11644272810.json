    "body": "Right on schedule at the start of the Olympics, Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai emerged Monday to declare that “everything is fine” and she was never assaulted by a member of the Communist Party elite. We wish we could believe that, but this is how China handles its periodic eruptions of individual protest or conscience. Down the memory hole.<br />Ms. Peng has been a public-relations problem for the Communist Party since she posted a social-media message in November that she had been forced to have sex with former Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli. The post disappeared quickly, but it received world-wide attention when global tennis stars and others in the West picked up her cause. She disappeared from sight. The Women’s Tennis Association was a rare organization that didn’t roll over for the People’s Republic and campaigned publicly for her whereabouts and safety."
