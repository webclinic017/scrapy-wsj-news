    "body": "I found “Too Risky to Wed in Your 20s? Not If You Avoid Cohabiting First” (Review, Feb. 5) thought-provoking. I had an arranged marriage. I was 23 years old when I married my husband, and we have been happily married for 40 years. We had met only 12 days before our wedding.<br />As a psychiatrist, I have been fascinated by the factors that play a role in determining the longevity of meaningful relationships. In my opinion, trust is the foundation, and love and acceptance are the building blocks of marriage. In my case, entering a marriage that was arranged was built entirely on trust. Trust in my parents to find my life partner, and my faith in their wisdom to make the right choice, led me into my relationship with my husband with open arms and a clear mind."
