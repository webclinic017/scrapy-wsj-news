    "body": "It is Ukraine that Russia is invading but, depending on the Kremlin’s whims, the rest of Europe could be subject to war-like rationing of energy. Natural-gas prices in Europe—already painfully high—are headed higher still. How much can the rest of the world pitch in?<br />Natural-gas futures in Europe soared almost 40% to $40.39 per million British thermal units on Thursday morning, about eight times where prices are in the U.S. Europe depends heavily on Russian natural gas; gas exports from the country met roughly 38% of European Union demand in 2020. With spring some months away, natural-gas inventory is still running about a quarter below the five-year average in the region, according to data from S&P Global Platts."
