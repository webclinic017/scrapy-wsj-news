    "body": "Many of us land-going creatures hear “sardines” and think lemon, garlic and olive oil. For those creatures living in and around the coastal waters of southeastern Africa, the annual, billions-strong migration of sardines—the largest movement of living things in the world, according to “The Ocean’s Greatest Feast”—means a moment of brief but endless bounty, an all-you-can-eat buffet for those with wings or fins and an appetite for seafood.<br />The running gag about nature programming is that it’s all about animals eating other animals. This “Nature” presentation is about animals eating the same animal, the small fish that follow the “tendrils” of cold water from the Atlantic as they course around the southern tip of Africa in April, just before the southern winter, and dissolve into the warmer Indian Ocean. Why the sardines make the trip is a mystery—as narrator Nora Young notes, there’s “no apparent benefit to the fish.” To birds, sharks, seals and dolphins, though, it’s matter of life and death. To the sardines, it’s mostly death."
