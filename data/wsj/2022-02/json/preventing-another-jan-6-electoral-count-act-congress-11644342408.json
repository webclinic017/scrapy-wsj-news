    "body": "Congress is finally moving to address the Electoral Count Act (ECA), the 1887 law that lets lawmakers think they can hijack the Electoral College vote count. That’s good news, but the only real way to prevent future mischief is to repeal this unconstitutional statute.<br />The Constitution gives state legislatures authority over the manner of choosing presidential electors. Congress’s role is to determine “the Time of chusing.” The Vice President’s job is to “open all the Certificates and the Votes shall then be counted.” But after the disputed election of 1876, Congress codified for itself a bigger role than the Founders intended."
