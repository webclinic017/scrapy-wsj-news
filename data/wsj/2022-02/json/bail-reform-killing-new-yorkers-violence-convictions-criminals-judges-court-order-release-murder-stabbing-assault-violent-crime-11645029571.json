    "body": "New York City is off to an inauspicious start on the crime front in 2022. Index crimes—murder, robbery, rape, aggravated assault, burglary, car theft and grand larceny—rose by nearly 40% in January compared with last year. Several high-profile violent crimes have shocked and outraged residents. Five New York City Police Department officers were shot in January, two of them fatally.<br />Mayor Eric Adams released a comprehensive plan late last month to address the crime surge. He called on Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state Legislature to reconsider some of the Empire State’s recently enacted criminal-justice reforms, bail reform in particular. So far his pleas seem to have fallen on deaf ears."
