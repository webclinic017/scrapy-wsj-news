    "body": "New York<br />To celebrate its 60th anniversary, the American Folk Art Museum is presenting an exuberant display of some 400 objects that convey the breadth and depth of the 8,000 pieces in its collection. “Multitudes,” fortuitously, also marks something even more important than a diamond jubilee: 10 years of stability after years of a nomadic existence and a near-death experience in 2011, when over-ambitious expansion plans forced the museum to sell its flashy, 10-year-old building to pay off debt and to explore a sale of the collection."
