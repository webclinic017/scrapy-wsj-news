    "body": "Vladimir Putin’s Ukraine invasion isn’t going according to his script, and for that the world owes a great debt to the heroic people of that besieged country of 41 million. Their resistance against fearsome odds is an inspiration and has awakened the world to the menace of the Kremlin autocrat. Ukraine deserves more support to raise the costs of war for Mr. Putin with arms, the toughest sanctions, and global ostracism.<br />Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky is proving to be the man for the moment as he rallies his country and the world to resist the invasion. “I need ammunition, not a ride,” Mr. Zelensky said, in a line for the ages, in response to a U.S. offer to help him leave Kyiv to escape a possible assassination."
