    "body": "Joel Zinberg’s op-ed “Covid Patients Suffer as Bureaucrats Try to Practice Medicine” (Feb. 8) eloquently points out how the Food and Drug Administration has exceeded its reach and is meddling in medical treatments.<br />Facing the pandemic, the medical profession took a back seat to the government task forces, which have made flagrant missteps. While physicians treated patients, the directions of care were outlined largely by government. How can we possibly think government agencies would be more adept than the clinicians, the “foot soldiers” in the field? Physicians have been disrespected—taken out of the equation and largely ignored or silenced in policy-making."
