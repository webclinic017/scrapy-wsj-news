    "body": "Venture and buyout funds are hugely popular—and also imperiled by ethical and other problems. I have a long history with such funds. As an adviser to Yale in the 1970s, I recommended that it make its first venture-capital investment. I gave similar advice to Harvard and other universities.<br />In 1985, David Swensen began his 36-year career as Yale’s chief investment officer and became the most successful institutional investor of his era. He greatly increased Yale’s allocation to venture funds and buyout funds. He also expressed to me his view that venture funds and buyout funds generally raised too much money and charged excessive fees."
