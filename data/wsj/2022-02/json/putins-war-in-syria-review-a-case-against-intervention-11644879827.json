    "body": "The civil war in Syria has been a strategic success for Vladimir Putin. Amid the turmoil, he expanded a naval base on the Eastern Mediterranean at Tartous,opened up a new market for Russian companies—especially in energy and phosphates—and shored up his relationships with both Syria and Iran. He also used the conflict as a testing ground for a wide array of new military hardware. None of this is ideal for the U.S., but in “Putin’s War in Syria: Russian Foreign Policy and the Price of America’s Absence,” Anna Borshchevskaya mistakenly tries to make the case that Moscow’s newfound advantage is proof that Washington should have intervened.<br />Ms. Borshchevskaya, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute, skillfully lays out Mr. Putin’s approach to the Middle East. She reminds us that the Soviet Union’s brief absence from the region in the years following the Cold War was a historical anomaly. This latest foray into Syria is best viewed, we are told, as a continuation of both czarist and Soviet interventions in the Middle East going back centuries."
