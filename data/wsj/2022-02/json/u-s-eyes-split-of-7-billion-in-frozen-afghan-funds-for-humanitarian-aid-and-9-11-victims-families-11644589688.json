    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is moving to split $7 billion in Afghanistan central bank reserves to provide humanitarian relief to Afghans and potential compensation for families of victims of the 9/11 attacks, according to administration officials.<br />The U.S. last August put a hold on the Taliban’s access to Da Afghanistan Bank’s reserves that are largely managed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York following the Taliban’s takeover of the country. The U.S. doesn’t recognize the Taliban as the legitimate government in Kabul, and has designated the armed movement as a terror group. It has also banned financial transactions with the group."
