    "body": "OF ALL THE culinary benefits of growing up in Baton Rouge, king cake was certainly the most colorful. In bakeries and grocery stores, it was always easy for me to spot this buttery, yeast-risen ring adorned with purple, green and gold sprinkles. During the Carnival season leading up to Mardi Gras, from Girl Scout meetings to church picnics, king cakes were ubiquitous.<br />Not until I studied abroad in Paris did I discover the king cake’s cousin, the galette des rois, baked for the feast of the Epiphany (Jan. 6). It actually looked more like a breakfast pastry to me than a cake—flaky layers of puff pastry filled with frangipane, the same combination of ground almonds, sugar and eggs found in almond croissants."
