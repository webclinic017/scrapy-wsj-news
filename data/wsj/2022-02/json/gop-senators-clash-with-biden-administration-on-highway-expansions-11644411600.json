    "body": "WASHINGTON—Top Senate Republicans are pushing back on a Biden administration effort to discourage states from using funds in the roughly $1 trillion infrastructure law to expand highways, as a separate partisan battle over government spending slows the release of much of the public-works money.<br />In a Wednesday letter, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R., W.Va.) wrote to U.S. governors that they should ignore recent guidance from the Biden administration about how to use the funds. The two senators, who each supported the law when it passed this summer, criticized a December memo from the Biden administration encouraging states to use new funding to maintain and improve highways before they use it to add lanes."
