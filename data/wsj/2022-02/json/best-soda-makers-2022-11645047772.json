    "body": "IF YOU WANT to sip something healthier than sugar-laced soda, seltzer is decidedly livelier than plain water. But schlepping seltzer home from the supermarket is decidedly a drag. As we’ve known since SodaStream took off in the 2010s, home seltzer makers—with their reusable bottles—offer a convenient way to reduce both your waist and your waste, but some seltzer connoisseurs remain skeptical.<br />Though Alex Gomberg, vice president of delivery service Brooklyn Seltzer Boys, says homemade seltzer will never be as bubbly as what old-school siphon bottles showily spew, he offers tips: Always use filtered water and store carbonated beverages in glass, not plastic bottles. “We triple-filter our water,” he said, but a standard water filter should suffice for home bubblifiers."
