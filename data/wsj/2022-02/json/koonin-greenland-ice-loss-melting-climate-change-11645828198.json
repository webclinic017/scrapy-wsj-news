    "body": "Steven Koonin’s arugment in “Greenland’s Melting Ice Is No Cause for Climate-Change Panic” (op-ed, Feb. 18) is based on an incorrect interpretation of the plotted data, which comes from research by one of us, Mr. Mankoff.<br />Mr. Koonin claims that “the annual loss of ice has been decreasing in the past decade even as the globe continues to warm.” While that is factually correct, it is an invalid interpretation, considering only the last decade and excluding previous periods. This is often referred to as “cherry picking.”"
