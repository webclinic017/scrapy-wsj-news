    "body": "Beyond Meat Inc .  shares dropped Friday after the plant-based meat alternative maker reported a bigger-than-anticipated quarterly loss and a sharp decline in U.S. grocery sales.<br />The California-based company late Thursday reported an $80.4 million net loss for the three months ended Dec. 31, saying weaker demand for its products in U.S. supermarkets compared to year-ago levels more than offset higher revenues from the companyâ€™s international and U.S. food-service business."
