    "body": "The cost of Amazon Prime just went up. But for many of us, the perks are likely still worth it.<br />Amazon.com Inc.  said Thursday that it’s raising the price of its popular delivery and digital-media service to $139 a year from $119 due to “continued expansion of Prime-member benefits” and higher costs for wages and transportation. Customers paying monthly will now pay $2 more at $14.99 a month."
