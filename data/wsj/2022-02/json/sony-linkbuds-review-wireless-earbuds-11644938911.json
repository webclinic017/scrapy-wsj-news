    "body": "I love wireless earbuds. I’ve reviewed a lot of different products over the years, from noise-canceling models to affordable options to the latest AirPods. But the in-ear bud style doesn’t suit everyone. Readers often email me saying earbuds cause them ear pain and create an uncomfortable feeling of pressure or suction.<br />I was drawn to  Sony ’s  new Bluetooth wireless headphones, called LinkBuds, because of their novel open-ring design, one that addresses some of those issues: They are earbuds minus the buds."
