    "body": "In 1974, Hugo Torres commanded a guerrilla raid that eventually led to the liberation of his then-comrade in arms Daniel Ortega, a key moment in the Sandinista revolution that toppled a dictator and helped Mr. Ortega take power.<br />Now, Mr. Torres has died in government custody, his family and the government said Saturday, having been arrested by Mr. Ortega’s government eight months ago for opposing his former ally’s increasingly dictatorial regime."
