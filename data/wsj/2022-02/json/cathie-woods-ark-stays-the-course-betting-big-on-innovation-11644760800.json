    "body": "Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management LLC is snapping up more shares of largely unprofitable companies, doubling down on a bet that many traders and investors expect to be tested this year by rising interest rates.<br />Over the past two weeks, Ms. Wood’s flagship  ARK Innovation  exchange-traded fund has bought more than $400 million of high-growth stocks, including  Roblox Corp. ,  Block Inc.  and  Robinhood Markets Inc.  That’s according to the firm’s daily trading logs and stock-pricing data as of Friday. She says the companies, which span videogaming, digital payments, trading and other industries, have the potential to change the world."
