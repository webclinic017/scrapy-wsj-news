    "body": "A few hours after Toby Robicelli first strapped on the $300 virtual-reality headset he got for Christmas, the Baltimore teenager, who was playing a shooter game called “Superhot VR,” lost his balance and fractured his kneecap.<br />“We set it up around 2:00,” said Toby’s mother, Allison Robicelli, of the tech gadget, “and by 8:00 we were on our way to the ER.” She fainted when she saw his leg, she said, and Toby, 14, is now using crutches."
