    "body": "NEW DELHI—As the U.S. and its allies condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, India is trying to maintain a tricky balance between a decadeslong strategic relationship with Moscow and New Delhi’s role in an emerging coalition of democracies.<br />The South Asian nation has avoided publicly denouncing Moscow as Russian airstrikes target dozens of Ukrainian cities and its forces advance on the capital of Kyiv. The invasion has prompted the U.S. and its allies to announce a slate of sanctions, including limits on Russian banks and a freeze on a gas pipeline project."
