    "body": "Two prosecutors leading the Manhattan district attorney’s investigation into former President Donald Trump and his business resigned Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter, casting doubt on the future of the yearslong criminal probe.<br />The resignation of the prosecutors, Carey Dunne and Mark Pomerantz, comes after recent weeks in which the grand jury hearing evidence appeared to pause its activity, according to other people familiar with the probe. The grand jury had previously heard testimony from witnesses including Mr. Trump’s longtime accountant, those people said."
