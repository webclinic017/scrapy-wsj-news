    "body": "The day before Cameron Kaplan’s op-ed “The High Cost of ‘Free’ Covid Testing” (Feb. 4) was published, I received a $5,025 “summary of claim for services” from my health-insurance provider. It included a $975 charge for a physician and five separate laboratory charges. Our insurance company paid about $1,200 and our uncovered liability was $655, for which we have not yet been billed. We had no idea what the bill was about.<br />We found the doctor named in the bill online, and he owns an urgent-care clinic near us. My wife needed a rapid PCR test in October, and paid $95 to get tested at the doctor’s clinic. How did a routine Covid test result in a $5,000 bill? And why did our insurance company agree to pay $1,200 for it? Can you imagine the scale at which this is happening nationwide? You don’t have to be an expert to know that something about this stinks."
