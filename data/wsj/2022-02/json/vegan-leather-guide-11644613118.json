    "body": "NOT SINCE the Space Race has fashion been so into science. In the past few years, luxury brands have been in R&D overdrive experimenting with vegan leather alternatives. Stella McCartney and Hermès are making “mushroom” leather handbags. Designer Guo Pei (best known for creating Rihanna’s yolk-yellow 2015 Met Gala gown) employed the pineapple leather Piñatex in her fall 2020 couture collection; labels including Karl Lagerfeld and Everlane have produced cactus-based leather accessories; and Gucci last year unveiled sneakers made of Demetra, the brand’s 77% plant-based material containing wood compounds.<br />Technically, old-school pleather (aka vinyl, aka the stuff that covered the seats of your grandfather’s 1980s station wagon) is vegan, but because it’s a plastic product, it’s not exactly eco-friendly—or even biodegradable in most cases. Thus, eco-conscious fashion fans are excited by the possibility of strutting around in fruits, veggies and fungus (yes, fungus). But while these earthy substitutes might seem more ethical than animal products, they come with their own share of problems."
