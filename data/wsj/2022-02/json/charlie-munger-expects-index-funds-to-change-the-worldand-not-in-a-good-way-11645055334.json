    "body": "Charlie Munger doesn’t think Larry Fink should be running the world.<br />Mr. Munger, the billionaire vice chairman of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  and Warren Buffett’s business partner, said the rise of index funds like those run by Mr. Fink’s  BlackRock Inc.  has resulted in an “enormous transfer” of the power to sway corporate decision making.
