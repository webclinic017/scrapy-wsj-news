    "body": "MEXICO CITY—President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who built his career as an anticorruption crusader and champion of an austere lifestyle, is at the center of a scandal over his eldest son’s use of a luxury Houston house then owned by an oil executive for a top contractor of Mexico’s state-run oil firm.<br />The president and his son said they haven’t done anything wrong. But the matter, which some have called Houstongate, has gained traction in recent weeks and prompted the president to call reporters who have covered the episode “mercenaries” and compare them to the mafia.  He also revealed disputed details about the income of Carlos Loret, one of the investigative reporters who broke the story, and asked Mexican tax officials to investigate him. Mexico’s Bar Association this month said the president’s disclosure about Mr. Loret broke tax-secrecy laws."
