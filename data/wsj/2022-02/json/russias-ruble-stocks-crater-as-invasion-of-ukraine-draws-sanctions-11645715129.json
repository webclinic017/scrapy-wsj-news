    "body": "Russia’s stock market and currency took historic blows in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, signs that the threat of Western sanctions is inflicting an immediate, though hard to assess, impact on the nation’s economy.<br />In the hours after tanks rolled across the border and Russian planes struck targets inside Ukraine, Russia’s stock market lost nearly half of its value before a partial rebound that still left it down by a third at the close of trading. The ruble fell 8% against the dollar, its biggest drop since the March 2020 Covid-19 market panic."
