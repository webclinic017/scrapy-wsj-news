    "body": "Your editorial “Biden’s Regulators Empower Putin” (Feb. 19) reminds me of the 1970s crude-oil price-control program. Rather than limit OPEC’s pricing power, our policy geniuses reduced the price responsiveness of global supply and demand, thereby enhancing OPEC’s market power.<br />I remember, as a young analyst at the American Petroleum Institute, using a simple supply-and-demand analysis to compute an OPEC price of $2 to $3 higher than the price without U.S. price controls. At 1970s prices, this was a significant effect. As we strengthen Russia’s hydrocarbon industry by restricting our own, and suffer the resulting higher energy prices, it appears nothing has been learned."
