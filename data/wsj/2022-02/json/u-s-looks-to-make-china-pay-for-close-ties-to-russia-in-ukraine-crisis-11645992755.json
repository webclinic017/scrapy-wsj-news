One step, U.S. officials said, is making Beijing feel pain over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.<br />Washington is looking to gain from any divisions between Moscow and Beijing,  the officials said, and Russia’s full-scale assault on Ukraine is an opportunity to force China to choose between siding with Russia and maintaining valuable economic ties to Europe, the U.S. and other parts of the world."
