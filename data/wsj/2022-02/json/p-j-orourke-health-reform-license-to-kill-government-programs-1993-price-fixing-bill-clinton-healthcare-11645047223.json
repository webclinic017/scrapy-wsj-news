    "body": "Editor’s note: This article appeared in The Wall Street Journal on Sept. 23, 1993. O’Rourke died Tuesday at 74.<br />I can’t seem to learn anything about President Clinton’s healthcare reform plan. I watch the network news and discover that the plan cannot be summarized briefly. I read the papers and find the plan cannot be explained at length. I listened to the president himself and he seems at least as confused as I am, though less succinctly."
