    "body": "Shelling intensified along the front line in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with Kyiv saying its troops have been issued orders to exercise restraint in responding to artillery fire so as to not give Russia a pretext to invade.<br />Heavy artillery, tank and mortar exchanges picked up Friday morning all along the cease-fire line separating the Ukrainian-controlled two-thirds of Donetsk and Luhansk from Russian-held areas, according to accounts from both sides. Violence in the regions had increased dramatically Thursday, with shells hitting a kindergarten and a school in Ukrainian-controlled towns."
