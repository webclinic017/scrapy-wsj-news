    "body": "In “If You Want Clean Power, Go Fission” (op-ed, Jan. 27), Robert Hargraves notes that fission is in fashion in several countries as the drawbacks of intermittent wind and solar power become apparent. Unfortunately, this is not the case here in America.<br />There are quite a few partially completed light-water nuclear power plants around the country. They could be completed, saving the time and cost of starting anew. The one I am most familiar with is Seabrook Station in New Hampshire, where I was project manager for design and construction. One of two units was completed and is operating. The incomplete unit has a completed cooling water system with two tunnels extending out under the ocean. Excavation of the site was finished and structures partially completed. The design was finished but will need to be modified."
