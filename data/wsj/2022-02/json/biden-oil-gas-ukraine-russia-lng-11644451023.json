    "body": "The editorial board’s promotion of domestic energy and exports in “The Economy That Might Have Been” (Jan. 28) is timely and should be heeded. It is understandable that the Biden administration is working with overseas oil and natural-gas producers to secure supplies ahead of a potential conflict between Russia and Ukraine. With Europe in an energy crunch, military action there could make a bad situation worse. The administration should also look to U.S. producers, who stand ready to provide significant assistance.<br />Europeans are paying natural-gas prices five times as high as they were a year ago. And Russia, which typically supplies about 40% of Europe’s natural gas, started cutting supplies several weeks ago. U.S. producers have responded quickly, increasing the share of exported liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe from 37% of U.S. LNG volumes earlier in 2021 to nearly half last month."
