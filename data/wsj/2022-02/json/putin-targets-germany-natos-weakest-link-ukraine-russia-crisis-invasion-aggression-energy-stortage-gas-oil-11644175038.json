    "body": "As the world wonders if Vladimir Putin will invade Ukraine, the battle for the West is already under way. Without firing a shot, Mr. Putin has attacked the trans-Atlantic alliance at its weakest link: Germany. When Chancellor Olaf Scholz visits the White House on Monday, it will be the most important meeting between a U.S. president and a German leader since before the Iraq war.<br />President Biden’s embrace of Mr. Scholz is only the latest act in the U.S. administration’s courtship of Germany, but the chancellor will arrive with one eye trained on Moscow. Mr. Scholz, who took office in December, is no Putin crony like Gerhard Schröder, Germany’s chancellor between 1998 and 2005. But both are part of the Social Democratic Party, which sees ties to Russia as central to its identity and essential for Germany. To justify their outreach, SDP leaders regularly cite their Cold War mantra, “America is indispensable, but Russia is immovable.” Mr. Scholz has either ignored Mr. Putin’s threats against Ukraine or, when pressed, mused on the value of engagement."
