    "body": "WASHINGTON—A Democratic bill aimed at solidifying women’s access to abortion was expected to be blocked in the Senate late Monday as lawmakers brace for a Supreme Court ruling later this year on the procedure.<br />The bill would bar restrictions on abortions before fetal viability or when a health provider determines the pregnancy risks the patient’s health."
