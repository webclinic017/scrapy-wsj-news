    "body": "BERLIN—Officials from Washington to London and Warsaw are asking whether Germany’s heavy dependence on Russian gas, its tradition of pacifism and its longstanding political and business links with Moscow—all forged over several decades—are now making it an unreliable ally in the crisis in Ukraine.<br />In recent weeks, Germany has refused to join the U.S. and others in shipping defensive weapons to Ukraine and blocked North Atlantic Treaty Organization partners from giving Kyiv German weapons; its navy chief resigned after making pro-Russian remarks; and Chancellor Olaf Scholz delayed a meeting with President Biden in Washington."
