    "body": "In “Cryptocurrency Doesn’t Amount to Much” (op-ed, Jan. 25), Steve Hanke and Matt Sekerke neglect a compelling reason for governments to refrain from monetizing cryptocurrencies. A major purpose of these cryptocurrencies is to get governments out of the business of creating money or, at a minimum, provide people an alternative to government money. Calls for government involvement in making cryptocurrencies stable and mainstream can be a gauge of how well the cryptocurrencies have been achieving that goal.<br />James Kirk"
