    "body": "When former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau invoked emergency powers in peacetime in 1970, he was accused of “using a sledgehammer to crack a peanut.” Fifty-two years later, his son, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has repeated the mistake.<br />The truckers protest against vaccine mandates, vilified by Mr. Trudeau as “racist” and “violent,” has been peaceful, but not every peaceful protest is legal. Blocking roads and border crossings disrupts lives and commerce. Government’s job is to maintain public order while respecting civil liberties."
