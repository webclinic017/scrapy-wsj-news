    "body": "Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny went on trial Tuesday facing embezzlement charges that could see his prison term extended by up to 15 years, in the latest salvo against Russia’s embattled opposition as the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine seizes the attention of Western powers.<br />Mr. Navalny, who has spent more than a decade waging a political campaign against President Vladimir Putin’s government, has denied the charges of embezzling funds given to his now-defunct foundation, which sought to expose corruption. He has said that the charges are part of a politically motivated campaign by the Kremlin to silence him. The Kremlin denies targeting Mr. Navalny for his criticism of Mr. Putin."
