    "body": "Stock futures, bond yields and international equities fell on the possibility of an imminent war in Europe, after weekend diplomacy between Western leaders and Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to yield a breakthrough.<br />Futures for the S&P 500 slid 0.9% in volatile trading Monday. Contracts for the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.1% and 0.8%, respectively. If the losses continue through the opening bell, they will compound a decline for stocks sparked Friday by U.S. warnings that Moscow could invade Ukraine at any moment."
