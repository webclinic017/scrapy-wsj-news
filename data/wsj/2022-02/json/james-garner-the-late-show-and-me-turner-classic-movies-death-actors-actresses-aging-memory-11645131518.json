    "body": "What they didn’t tell me about getting old is how I’d have trouble remembering who I am. There was once a kid who watched TV, and then a grown man settling in to my first job. But what connects them all to me now?<br />I’ve moved on, from school to school, city to city, always leaving the past behind. The cord that binds all these people together comes from my family, a mountain of guilt (as I’m Irish) and “TCM Remembers,” the tribute Turner Classic Movies pays to movie people who died the year before."
