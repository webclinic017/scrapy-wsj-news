    "body": "Those reading Zillow’s fourth-quarter shareholder letter once again got a master class in sales. Never mind the real-estate tech giant’s iBuying fiasco, Chief Executive Officer Rich Barton wrote, “our mission has been steady.” He noted  Zillow  will remain focused on shifting from a purely ad-based model to one that is focused on transactions. Investors continue to eat up the pitch, and his notion of Zillow’s next chapter as a “housing super app,” that “turns dreams into transactors” did not disappoint.<br />In conjunction with its earnings release, Zillow introduced long-term targets for 2025, including achieving annual revenue of $5 billion—56% more than Wall Street analysts had been modeling. This target comes as the company says it expects to complete the wind-down of its automated home-flipping business in the second half of this year. That business, housed under Zillow’s “Homes” segment, generated roughly 85% of its fourth-quarter revenue and 74% of its revenue for all of 2021."
