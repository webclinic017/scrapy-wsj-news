Samsung Electronics Co.  hopes its latest models will stoke excitement in its most loyal fan base: users of its recently discontinued Galaxy Note.<br />The South Korean electronics company on Wednesday unveiled three additions to its smartphone lineup: the $800 Galaxy S22, $1,000 Galaxy S22+ and $1,200 Galaxy S22 Ultra. Many specs are similar to those of last year’s Galaxy S21 lineup—including the prices—but the new Ultra comes with something previously found only in the Note: a built-in slot for the included S Pen stylus."
