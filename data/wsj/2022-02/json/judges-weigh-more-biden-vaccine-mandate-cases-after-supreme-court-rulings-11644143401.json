    "body": "Courts around the country are weighing how to apply the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent mixed guidance on the federal government’s power to impose Covid-19 vaccine mandates, as judges consider whether the Biden administration can enforce such requirements on groups including government contractors and federal workers.<br />Last month, the Supreme Court issued a pair of divided rulings that pulled in different directions. In one, the court blocked the Biden administration’s most sweeping mandate, which required private employers to ensure their workers were vaccinated or tested weekly. But a second decision allowed a federal vaccine mandate for most healthcare workers."
