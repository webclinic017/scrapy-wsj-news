    "body": "After a weak initial effort last week, the U.S. and Europe are getting more serious about pursuing the wealth of Vladimir Putin’s billionaire coterie. The countries said Saturday they’re creating a trans-Atlantic task force to find and seize their ill-gotten assets.<br />The task force will “identify, hunt down, and freeze the assets of sanctioned Russian companies and oligarchs,” said a senior Biden Administration official. “We’ll go after their yachts, their luxury apartments, their money, and their ability to send their kids to fancy colleges in the West.”"
