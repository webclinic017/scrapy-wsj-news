    "body": "Investors are growing concerned that a Russia-Ukraine conflict could send inflation to new heights as oil trades close to $100 a barrel.<br />The most visible effect is in Europe, where 10-year German bund yields rose as high as 0.27% this week from negative territory earlier in the year. Europe is in a tricky spot given its reliance on Russian energy supplies and a central bank that has been less aggressive than the Federal Reserve about tightening policy."
