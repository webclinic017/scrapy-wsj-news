    "body": "WASHINGTON—Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Biden’s nominee to become the government’s top bank regulator, goes to Capitol Hill on Thursday to face lawmakers’ questions about her support for tougher banking rules and for using financial regulation to address climate change—positions cheered by Democrats but criticized by Republicans.<br />Mr. Biden picked Ms. Raskin to serve as the Federal Reserve’s vice chairwoman for banking supervision. She is set to appear at her Senate Banking Committee confirmation hearing along with two economists nominated for other Fed board seats: Lisa Cook, a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University, and Philip Jefferson, a professor and administrator at Davidson College in North Carolina."
