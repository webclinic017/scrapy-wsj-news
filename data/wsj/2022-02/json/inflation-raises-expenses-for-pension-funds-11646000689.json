    "body": "Rising inflation is driving up expenses for many large U.S. pension funds that have promised retirees cost-of-living raises.<br />About half of states link pension benefits for some or all of their retired workers to changes in the consumer-price index, according to the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. With inflation reaching 7% in December, some retirement funds are now looking at increasing pension checks by 3% or more for the first time in a decade. At others, board members or state officials are approving one-time cost-of-living raises."
