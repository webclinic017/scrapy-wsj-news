    "body": "HEART-SHAPED SWEETS are never in short supply at this time of year. From cellophane-wrapped boxes of chocolates to Sweethearts candies beseeching “Be Mine,” the usual edible modes of making one’s feelings known come Feb. 14 are widely—almost oppressively—available. Wouldn’t it be so much nicer to introduce an element of surprise this time around? For those seeking something more unexpected and still unabashedly lovey-dovey, the answer is a rich, luscious coeur à la crème—French for cream heart.<br />Though a bit old-fashioned, coeur à la crème remains a staple in France, and it’s not hard to see why. It is surprisingly simple to prepare—really just a mix of lightly sweetened cream and fresh cheese left overnight in a perforated, heart-shaped mold to drain off excess liquid and achieve a satisfying, dense consistency."
