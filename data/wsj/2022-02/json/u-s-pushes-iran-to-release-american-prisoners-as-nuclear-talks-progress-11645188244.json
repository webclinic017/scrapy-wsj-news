    "body": "As the U.S., Iran and other world powers make progress toward a nuclear deal, a separate but closely linked set of talks is under way: an effort to free American and European prisoners held by Iran.<br />At least six American and British citizens are being held in Iranian prisons on charges that Western officials say are trumped up. They include Morad Tahbaz, a British-American conservationist who was jailed in January 2018; Emad Shargi, a businessman; and Siamak Namazi, a U.S. business consultant who was arrested in Tehran on a visit in 2015, as well as his father, Baquer Namazi."
