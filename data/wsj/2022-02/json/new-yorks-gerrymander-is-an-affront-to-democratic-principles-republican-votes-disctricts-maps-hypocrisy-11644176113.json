    "body": "Live from New York, it’s gerrymandering. Last week Gov. Kathy Hochul signed into law a new congressional map that is expected to eliminate half of the state’s Republican delegation. The map favors Democrats in 85% of House seats in a state Joe Biden won with 60% of the popular vote.<br />As a Democrat living in New York, I want my party to win as many House seats as possible. But this map is dangerous. Democratic voters deserve better from the people we voted for."
