    "body": "The floor plan of “The Girl Before”—the latest in what now seems a hallowed tradition of imperiled-women miniseries on HBO—seems inevitable enough, maybe even overdue: the smart home as a haunted house. While it’s not quite that simple in this four-part melodrama, the automated domicile does have its array of horror-movie accessories: disembodied voices; the sense of being watched; things that go bump—or worse—in the night. Have you ever seen Alexa? Me neither.<br />Granted, it’s an extreme version of a smart house that lies at the center of this BBC-HBO co-production and occupies a cul-de-sac in a fashionable section of London. Why is the rent below market? Because the lease comes with conditions. No pictures, no ornaments, no carpets, no rugs. No children. No books. A prospective tenant has to agree to live in this minimalist one-bedroom “the way he intended,” he being the inscrutable architect Edward Monkford (David Oyelowo). “About 200 in all,” a slightly abashed rental agent says, meaning the rules that come with the deal. There will be inspections."
