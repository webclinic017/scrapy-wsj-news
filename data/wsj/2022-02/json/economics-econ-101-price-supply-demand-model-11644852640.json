    "body": "In his otherwise excellent column “Wealth Is Knowledge” (Inside View, Feb. 7), Andy Kessler makes a common Econ 101 mistake. He says, “You were taught about supply and demand curves and that when prices drop, supply needs to come down to reach equilibrium.” No. This confuses cause and effect. A change in supply can cause a price change, but a price change does not change supply. Rather, a price change is evidence that the equilibrium has moved because either supply or demand has already changed.<br />As I read the article, in my mind I heard economist David Henderson warning: “Never reason from a price change.” This will be a great example for my class of how easy it is for even smart people to make mistakes, even with the simple supply-and-demand model."
