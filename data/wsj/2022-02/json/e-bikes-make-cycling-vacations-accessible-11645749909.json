    "body": "Jeremy Dubow, an avid cyclist and Chicago business owner, never thought he would be able to take a cycling vacation with his partner, Kathleen Kustra. A five-mile bike ride in the city was enough to tell them it wouldn’t work, he says. He would get annoyed having to slow his pace to wait for Ms. Kustra, or she would get frustrated trying to keep up with him.<br />That all changed in 2019 when he convinced her to join him on a cycling trip to Tucson, Ariz., using an electric bike. The e-bike has been the equalizer for the couple, they say, allowing Ms. Kustra to finally enjoy her partner’s passion, joining him on one or two group cycling trips a year. “I’m looking for the hardest trip with the most miles and most climbing,” says the 45-year-old Mr. Dubow. ”And now not only can she keep up, she pushes me.”"
