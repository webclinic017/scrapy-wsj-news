    "body": "In this era of monetary-policy experimentation, it’s always worth checking on the Frankenstein’s lab of central banking: Japan. Tokyo in recent days has taken steps to defend one of its more adventurous policy moves, for reasons and with potential consequences that warrant watching.<br />The issue is yield-curve control, under which the central bank sets an explicit peg for one or more interest rates and then trades bonds as needed to defend the peg. The Bank of Japan was a modern pioneer when it dusted off this mid-20th century relic in 2016, capping interest on 10-year government bonds at 0.25%."
