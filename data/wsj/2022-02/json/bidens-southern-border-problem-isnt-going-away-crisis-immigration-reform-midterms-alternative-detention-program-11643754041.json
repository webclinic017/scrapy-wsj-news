    "body": "When is Joe Biden going to realize that Donald Trump didn’t lose the election in 2020 because of his stance on illegal immigration? The Biden administration doesn’t seem much interested in the havoc on our southern border, but the problem isn’t going away. If anything, the situation has been worsening, and Republicans are certain to tee up border security as a midterm campaign theme.<br />Mr. Biden’s overall job-approval rating is in the low 40s. That’s worrying enough for Democrats, but Americans think even less of how the president is handling immigration, with only 36% of respondents voicing satisfaction in a recent CBS News poll. Obviously, people other than Fox News viewers are paying attention to the crisis. And what they’ve seen over the past year, in addition to White House indifference, is record levels of illicit border crossings, overflowing detention centers and, more recently, video footage of illegal immigrants being ferried (in the dead of night) from the southern border to New York, Florida and other parts of the country."
