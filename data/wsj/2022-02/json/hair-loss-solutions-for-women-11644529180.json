    "body": "FOR MANY WOMEN, hair loss is hard on the psyche. “Our hair is like an accessory—it’s our crown. It’s so tied to society’s perception of beauty. So, when we lose hair, it’s devastating,” said New York dermatologist Marie Hayag. “Of all the medical conditions I see in my office, hair loss–especially in women–causes more tears.”<br />Before maxing out your credit card on the dubious “miracle fixes” constantly advertised on Instagram, get to the root of what could be causing your hair loss, said Bridgette Hill, a Palm Beach certified trichologist and founder of Root Cause Scalp Analysis, a virtual service that specializes in hair and scalp issues. Common culprits: “It could be genetics, lifestyle, diet, medication, stress or hormonal imbalances. It could be a multitude of things and a combination of those things. That’s what makes [treating thinning hair] so challenging,” said Ms. Hill. But with the right treatment (or a combo of remedies), an increase in fullness is possible, she said. Just keep in mind that patience is required. “To see any changes, you may need a minimum of 90 days,” said Ms. Hill. Here, experts suggest three ways to help pump up the volume."
