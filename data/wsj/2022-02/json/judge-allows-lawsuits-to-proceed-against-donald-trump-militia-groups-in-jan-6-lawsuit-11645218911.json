    "body": "A federal judge ruled Friday that a landmark series of lawsuits can proceed against former President Donald Trump over his actions leading up to the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, ruling that his status as president at the time doesnâ€™t make him immune from being held to account in court over his role in the events.<br />U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington ruled that three lawsuits brought by various Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill as well as two U.S. Capitol Police officers could proceed against Mr. Trump and various militia groups, including the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers and Warboys. The suits say Mr. Trump was involved in a civil conspiracy to disrupt the election."
