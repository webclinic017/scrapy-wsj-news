    "body": "Over the past two years, investor demand for convertible bonds got so hot that bankers did something unprecedented: They sold nearly $57 billion of bonds that pay no interest, according to data compiled by  JPMorgan Chase  & Co.<br />Investors gobbled up convertible bonds with zero coupon from companies including  Airbnb ,   SoFi ,   Snap ,   Ford ,   DraftKings ,   Twitter ,   Shake Shack ,   Spotify  and  Dish Network .  They were essentially lending the companies money at 0% interest, hoping shares would rise enough that they could convert their bonds into stock. But with higher interest rates coming, the reign of the zero-coupon convertible bond is likely coming to an end in 2022, bankers say."
