    "body": "A Russian invasion of Ukraine would be a seminal event that accelerates the new world disorder. The signs have been building for years, but America and its allies are unprepared, as democracies usually are, for the trouble to come. President Biden has a particular obligation to explain the stakes and unite the country as other Presidents have done to meet the challenge.<br />The Biden Administration has done a decent rear-guard job of mobilizing Europe and NATO in opposition to Russia’s designs on Ukraine—despite his blunder in dropping Nord Stream 2 sanctions. The allies are mostly on board the U.S. promise of “massive consequences” if Russia invades, though we wonder how long Germany, France and Italy would stay the course. The weak Western sanctions after Russia’s invasion of Georgia in 2008, and Crimea in 2014, encouraged Vladimir Putin to believe Europe lacks the will to resist with anything serious."
