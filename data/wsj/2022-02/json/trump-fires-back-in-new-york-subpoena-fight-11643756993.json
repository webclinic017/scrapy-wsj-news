    "body": "Lawyers for former President Donald Trump and two of his adult children argued Tuesday that the New York state attorney general’s office had targeted them unfairly in its civil-fraud investigation and subpoenaed information that could be improperly used in a separate criminal probe.<br />The arguments came in a dispute over subpoenas New York Attorney General Letitia James issued to Mr. Trump, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr., that seek their testimony and the former president’s personal and business documents for a civil-fraud investigation into Mr. Trump and his company. Lawyers for the Trumps have asked a New York state judge to block the subpoenas or put them on hold until a parallel criminal investigation conducted by the Manhattan district attorney’s office has concluded."
