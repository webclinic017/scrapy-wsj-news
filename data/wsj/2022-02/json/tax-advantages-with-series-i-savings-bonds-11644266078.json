    "body": "At first glance, a stodgy, government-guaranteed investment may not seem like the most thrilling investment idea. But for many investors that’s exactly what U.S. Treasury Series “I” savings bonds are these days.<br />New I bonds sold by the Treasury from November 2021 through April 2022 earn interest at a mouthwatering annualized rate of 7.12%. (A new rate will be set every six months after that.) And that rate is attracting droves of safety-conscious investors looking for a hedge against inflation, plus a few tax advantages."
