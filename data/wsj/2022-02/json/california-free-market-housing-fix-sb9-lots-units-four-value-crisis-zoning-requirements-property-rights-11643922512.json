    "body": "Has California’s housing crisis gotten so bad that the state is willing to try a free-market approach? The recent passage of SB9, also known as the California Housing Opportunity and More Efficiency Act, suggests so.<br />The new law upends the long-held assumption that elites can allocate resources better than markets. In California, that belief produced zoning overreach, excessive land-use restrictions, urban growth boundaries, endless environmental reviews and further regulation by neighborhood groups and local officials. All that made buildable land scarce and expensive."
