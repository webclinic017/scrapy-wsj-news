    "body": "‘Stakeholder capitalism is not about politics. . . . It is capitalism.” Or so  BlackRock  CEO Larry Fink claimed in his annual letter to America’s CEOs last month, in which he called on corporate chiefs to stay true to their own companies’ “purpose.”<br />“Putting your company’s purpose at the foundation of your relationships with your stakeholders is critical to your long-term success. . . . Your company’s purpose is its north star in this tumultuous environment. . . . It is more important than ever that your company and its management be guided by its purpose.” Mr. Fink’s four-page letter invokes the word “purpose” eight times."
