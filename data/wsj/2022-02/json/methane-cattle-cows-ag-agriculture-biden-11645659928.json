    "body": "“Methane Clampdown Gives Cattle a Break” (U.S. News, Feb. 14) presents an incomplete picture of the reasons the Biden administration isn’t calling for increased regulation of animal agriculture in its climate initiatives.<br />Agriculture contributes roughly 10% of U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions, and beef production accounts for only 2%. The article focuses on cattle methane emissions but fails to take the entire life cycle of the animal into account. Methane, unlike carbon dioxide, breaks down relatively quickly in the atmosphere, which means methane from cattle is being destroyed even as new gases are created. The carbon byproduct caused by the breaking down of methane is then absorbed by plants that will feed the cattle again."
