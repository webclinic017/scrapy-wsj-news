    "body": "WASHINGTON—In the weeks since President Biden’s agenda stalled in a bitterly divided Congress, something unusual happened on Capitol Hill: Democrats and Republicans started working together.<br />Already, bills to make the U.S. Postal Service more financially viable, boost U.S. competitiveness with China and ban mandatory arbitration in cases of sexual assault and harassment have picked up steam in Congress. Senators passed the arbitration bill by voice vote, sending it to the president’s desk without a single member of either party demanding a roll call to record yeas and nays."
