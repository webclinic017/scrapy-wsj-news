    "body": "A FRIEND OF MINE recently compared locked-down New York City to a Champagne bottle, full of bubbles and ready to pop. Aren’t we all? At this point, I’d go to the opening of an envelope. Lead me to an overflowing Champagne tower. I want some romance, a conga line, elaborate synchronized swimming routines, black tie, lipstick and off-the-shoulder sequins. I’m ready to dance the night away as waiters glide past on roller skates, balancing trays full of these piquant gougères.<br />I don’t usually celebrate Valentine’s Day in grand style, but this year I certainly intend to, even if I am doing it at home. And while I’m not entirely confident I‘ll be able to rustle up the waiters or the roller skates, I know this recipe can be counted on to produce a real showstopper—light, cheesy little pastry puffs filled with savory sautéed mushrooms—and it’s entirely doable for any home cook. After seeing folks taking on ambitious Covid cooking projects, I figured baking pâte à choux (French pastry dough) at home would be a walk in the park, and I was right. Simple, classic gougères belong in your repertoire—always a boon companion to a glass of wine and a cocktail-party hit."
