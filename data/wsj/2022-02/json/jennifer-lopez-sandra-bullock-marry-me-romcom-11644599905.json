    "body": "The romantic comedy, regularly declared dead in Hollywood, is anything but.<br />A run of experimental twists on the rom-com, along with the return of some big stars, have helped revive the genre. Streaming platforms have been buoyed by hit romance series like “Bridgerton,” while the film “Crazy Rich Asians,” a splashy rom-com with a majority Asian cast, made a fortune at the box office."
