    "body": "Unilever  Chief Executive Alan Jope was under fire even before he delivered more bad news to investors Thursday. But the company’s problems aren’t the type that could be quickly fixed by new leadership.<br />As it reported fourth-quarter results, the consumer-staples giant behind Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream said its 2022 operating margins would fall by up to 2.4 percentage points from today’s level of 18.4%. Analysts covering the stock had expected a 0.4 percentage point dip. What is worrying is that the lower margin only reflects the impact of higher inflation, not plans to increase marketing or innovation budgets to improve growth."
