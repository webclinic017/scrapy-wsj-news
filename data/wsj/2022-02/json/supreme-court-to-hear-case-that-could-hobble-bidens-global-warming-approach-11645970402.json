    "body": "WASHINGTON—The scope of federal power to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions comes before the Supreme Court on Monday, as a coalition of Republican-led states seeks to limit measures the Environmental Protection Agency can impose on power plants.<br />Currently, no federal regulation directly limits such emissions from power plants. Lawsuits kept both the Obama-era 2015 Clean Power Plan and the Trump administration’s less-stringent replacement, the 2019 Affordable Clean Energy Rule, from taking effect. The industry met the 2015 emission targets anyway as more efficient ways to tap renewable sources such as solar power and wind became available."
