    "body": "Roku was really on fire for a couple of seasons.<br />Since the TV streaming pioneer’s stock hit an all-time high last July, though, the company has shed a wrenching $49 billion—three-quarters of its market value. The most recent brutal episode was a 22% plunge on Friday following the company’s fourth-quarter results. That drop put the shares back around their level from early 2020, before the pandemic sent people rushing home to their connected TVs, boosting Roku’s sales, adjusted earnings and stock price."
