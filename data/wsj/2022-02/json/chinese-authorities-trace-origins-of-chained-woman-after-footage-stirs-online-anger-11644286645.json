    "body": "Authorities in an eastern corner of China where video footage recently emerged of a mother of eight chained in a shed said they have traced the origins of the woman to a village in China’s south.<br />The footage of the woman, shown with a chain around her neck in a shed without a door, had prompted many on China’s social media to demand that authorities investigate her origins and whether she was a “bought wife” who had been brought to the village where she lived as a result of human trafficking, a practice China has cracked down on in recent decades."
