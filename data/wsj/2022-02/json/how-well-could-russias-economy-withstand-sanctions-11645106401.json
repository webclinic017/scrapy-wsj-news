    "body": "When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, the European Union, U.S. and other countries hit Moscow with punitive economic measures. Russian individuals and organizations have since been sanctioned for interfering in overseas elections, cyberattacks and other actions. Now, Russia has amassed tens of thousands of Russian troops along Ukraine’s borders in what some fear could be a prelude to a full-scale invasion.<br />In response, the U.S. is threatening additional sanctions, including cutting off Russian banks’ access to the dollar and employing novel export controls."
