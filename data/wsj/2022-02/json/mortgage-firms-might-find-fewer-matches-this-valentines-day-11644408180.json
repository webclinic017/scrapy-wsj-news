    "body": "Mortgage rates are still pretty decent for potential borrowers, but their rapid jump has still been enough to cause more problems for home-lending stocks.<br />The increase so far this year in average weekly U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates measured by  Freddie Mac ,  from about 3.1% at the end of December to over 3.5% in early February, has pushed them back to early 2020 levels. That is still very attractive, historically speaking, but not good enough for lenders. With millions of people already having lowered their rates during the pandemic, the pool of people who would be easy targets for refinancing is now shrinking quickly."
