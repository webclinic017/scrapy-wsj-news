    "body": "Regarding Jonathan Turley’s op-ed “A College Couldn’t Get Away With Biden’s High-Court Criteria” (Jan. 27): President Biden’s criteria for the Supreme Court is blatantly discriminatory toward the qualified noncandidates—the white females and the black and white males who will not even be considered for this vacancy.<br />It is also demeaning to the black women who compose this select group of candidates, by the inference that Mr. Biden needs to eliminate almost all the competition for them to be considered. Who wants to win a race that way?"
