    "body": "A shortfall in global energy supplies is spilling into crude markets and could add momentum to this year’s rally in oil prices, investors say.<br />Even though it ended Tuesday’s session lower, Brent crude, the global gauge of oil prices, is near its highest level in three years and traded above $80 a barrel early in the day. It closed down 0.6% at $79.09 as rising government-bond yields prompted a broad retreat from stocks and commodities but is still up more than 50% in 2021."
