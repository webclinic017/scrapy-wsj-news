    "body": "President Biden’s tweet Saturday that “My Build Back Better Agenda costs zero dollars” is reminiscent of President Obama’s June 2009 claim that, under his Affordable Care Act, “if you like the plan you have, you can keep your health care plan.”<br />It’s not only that Mr. Obama’s phrase won PolitiFact’s 2013 “Lie of the Year” award and that Mr. Biden’s tweet likely deserves that honor as well. More important, the ACA lie was also a major factor in one of the greatest midterm massacres ever, when Democrats lost six seats in the Senate, 63 in the House, six governorships and a record 680 state legislative seats in 2010."
