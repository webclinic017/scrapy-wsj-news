    "body": "WASHINGTON—Plenty of House Republicans support what is in the roughly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill. The vast majority of them won’t vote for it.<br />Unlike its passage in the Senate, where the infrastructure bill secured the support of 19 Republicans alongside all 50 members of the Democratic caucus, the bill faces a more complicated path in the House, where a much smaller slice of the caucus is expected to back the measure when it comes up for a vote as soon as Thursday."
