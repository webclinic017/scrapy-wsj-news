    "body": "‘What are we dealing with?” asks a heavily armed federal officer in “Queenpins,” readying his Kevlar, helmet and attitude. “Drug runners? Arms dealers?” No, no, he’s told: “Coupons.”<br />It’s true. Close to it anyway. You can get away with a lot being “inspired by a true story.” Directed by Aron Gaudet and Gita Pullapilly, “Queenpins” stars Kristen Bell and Kirby Howell-Baptiste as coupon-clippers run amok who turn a small-time scam into an enterprise that eventually involves money-laundering, Lamborghinis, black-market sperm, and gun-running to white nationalist militias. And SWAT teams bursting in at dawn."
