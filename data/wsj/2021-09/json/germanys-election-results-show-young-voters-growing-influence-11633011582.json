    "body": "BERLIN—Germany’s youngest voters are turning their backs on big, established parties and casting their ballots for two smaller groups that are calling for change: one focused on climate and social justice, the other on freer markets and personal liberties.<br />Some 44% of voters under 25 picked the Greens or the Free Democrats in Sunday’s election while just a quarter voted for the center-left Social Democratic Party or the conservative Christian Democratic Union, according to preliminary analyses by polling form Infratest dimap. The figures were similar for first-time voters, the biggest share of whom opted for the FDP."
