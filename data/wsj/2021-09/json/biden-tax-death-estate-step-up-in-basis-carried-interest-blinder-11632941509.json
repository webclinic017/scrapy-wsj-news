    "body": "After praising President Biden’s proposal to impose the income tax on unrealized capital gains at death (“House Democrats Miss Some Necessary Tax Increases,” op-ed, Sept. 27), Alan Blinder mentions as “one objection” that the proposal might force heirs to sell the family farm to pay the tax bill. He then dismisses this, calling it “as red a herring as you will ever see,” only to cite a federal estate-tax exemption—“the first roughly $11.7 million can be passed on to heirs tax-free”—that has nothing to do with the Biden proposal. Only the first $1 million of unrealized gains ($2 million in some cases) would be exempt from income taxation at death under Mr. Biden’s proposal, which could indeed force sales of family farms, businesses and even homes.<br />Jim Fitter"
