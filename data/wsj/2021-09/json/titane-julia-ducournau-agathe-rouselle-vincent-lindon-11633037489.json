    "body": "‘Titane,” the title of Julia Ducournau’s second French-language feature, means titanium. Does that mean the film, which won a Palme d’Or at this year’s Cannes Film Festival, is a documentary about knee replacement, or a celebration of one of Frank Gehry’s favorite building materials? No, it’s a story about a girl, and then a young woman, with a titanium plate in her head—an astonishing and horrific thriller that has been constructed, like few films I’ve ever seen, to make you turn away from its frequent eruptions of savagery but then look back, just as often, to savor its mysterious beauty.<br />When I reviewed “Raw,” the 2016 debut feature that Ms. Ducournau devoted to cannibalism, I called it “shockingly well made” and said the filmmaker was “clearly destined for mainstream success if that’s where her appetites take her.” Not a terrible guess, based on technical and artistic achievement, but hardly a prescient one either. Those appetites turn out to have taken her into a bloodstream of violence, a spiritual realm of Stygian darkness."
