    "body": "Kim Yo Jong, believed to be at least 32 years old, is a senior North Korean official helping oversee the country’s policies toward the U.S. and South Korea, according to Seoul’s intelligence agency.<br />She is often at her brother’s side during key events in the one-party state. Among her various titles, Ms. Kim is the nominal head of the North’s propaganda and agitation department. She rose to prominence in just the past several years, attending all three face-to-face meetings between then-President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, as the latter’s confidante and adviser. She was an alternate member of North Korea’s Politburo until January 2021, though North Korea experts say the apparent demotion still leaves her political clout unchanged."
