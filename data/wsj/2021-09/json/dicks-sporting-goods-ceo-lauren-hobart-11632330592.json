    "body": "Lauren Hobart took the top job at  Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc.  earlier this year, becoming one of a few dozen female CEOs to helm America’s largest companies and the third person to run the family-owned retailer since its start in 1948.<br />Last fiscal year, Dick’s comparable sales—those from stores and digital channels operating for at least 12 months—rose faster than ever in the company’s history, up 9.9% year-over-year, driven by demand for outdoor and fitness gear during the pandemic, the company said. Strong demand has continued this year, with comparable sales up 115% in the fiscal first quarter ended May 1 versus the year-earlier period when stores closed amid the pandemic, and 19.2% in the second quarter."
