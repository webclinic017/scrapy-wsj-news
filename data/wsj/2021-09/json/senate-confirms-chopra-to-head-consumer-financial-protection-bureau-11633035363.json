    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The Senate on Thursday confirmed Rohit Chopra to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, overcoming Republican opposition that had slowed his nomination.<br />The 50-48 vote, along party lines, shows how the agency created in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008-2009 remains a partisan flashpoint. Democrats have wanted a muscular CFPB to take on what they characterize as financial-industry excesses. Republicans and Wall Street firms have criticized the bureau as an instrument of runaway government regulation, with too much power over a significant slice of the economy."
