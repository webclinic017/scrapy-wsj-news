    "body": "As surprises go,  Micron Technology ’s  disappointing projection hardly qualifies.<br />The maker of memory chips posted relatively strong results for its fiscal fourth quarter late Tuesday. But its projection of $7.65 billion in revenue for its first quarter ending in November was nearly 11% short of Wall Street’s official forecast, as reflected by consensus projections on FactSet. Yet several analysts had been predicting a shortfall, and the market has been dim on Micron anyway given the cyclical nature of the memory business. Micron’s share price had fallen nearly 16% over the past six months before Tuesday’s report—making it one of the weakest performers in the chip market."
