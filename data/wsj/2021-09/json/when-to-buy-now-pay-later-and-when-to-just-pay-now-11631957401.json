    "body": "Digital buy now, pay later services are surging in popularity. While they offer consumers appetizing convenience, these services also leave some with regrets.<br />Companies such as Affirm and Klarna Bank AB enable shoppers to purchase products online, have them delivered as usual, then pay for their order in installments. Sometimes these services come with interest and sometimes they are interest free. This app-based version of layaway—making small payments for an item over time—has skyrocketed in usage among both consumers and retailers.  Afterpay Ltd. , one of the most popular platforms, said sales among its U.S. merchant partners will increase by $8.2 billion this year thanks to payment plans."
