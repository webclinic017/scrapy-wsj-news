    "body": "AS THE PANDEMIC drags on, so does the seemingly unending marathon of home cooking. But if we’re still madly searching online at 5 p.m. for another way to make sheet-pan chicken, and ending each week with a crisper drawer of wilting produce and a fridge full of miscellaneous leftovers, can we really say we know how to cook? Two upcoming cookbooks aim to address just this sort of question.<br />In “Cooking at Home: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying About Recipes (And Love My Microwave): A Cookbook” (Oct. 26, Clarkson Potter), chef and restaurateur David Chang boldly asserts that it’s not cooking that’s the problem—it’s the very notion of recipes. Mr. Chang, who co-wrote the book with food writer Priya Krishna, freely admits that, until relatively recently, he didn’t cook at home at all. His approach to food was formed by his culinary school training, and, later, the discipline of restaurant cooking. Mr. Chang believes this rigid, prescriptive approach has spread to home cooks as well: “We’ve created generations of people who rely on recipes and can’t actually cook a dish without one.”"
