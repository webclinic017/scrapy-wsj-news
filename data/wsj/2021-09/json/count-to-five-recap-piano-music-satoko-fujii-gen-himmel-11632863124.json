    "body": "<br />Composition, at heart, has always been a matter of transforming relatively simple sounds—the raw tones of an instrument or voice—into structures that make sense to a listener. But there has also been an implicit challenge for composers, especially over the past century, to make their sonic manipulations more extreme, either by altering the traditional sound beyond recognition or by placing familiar timbres in unusual contexts. On new recordings by Recap, a young percussion quartet from New Jersey, and Satoko Fujii, a prolific Japanese jazz pianist with experimental leanings, composers—all women—offer fresh ways to reconfigure sound, with generally stunning results."
