    "body": "The Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently ruled that Santosuossos, an Italian restaurant in Medina, Ohio, wasn’t entitled to payment for a claim on its business-interruption insurance after a state order prohibited in-person dining. Such policies cover lost income when a business is shut down because of physical loss of or damage to its property.<br />The tribunal concluded that while Santosuossos lost the ability to use its property as an in-person eatery, the governor’s shutdown orders didn’t physically alter the restaurant’s structure. There was nothing to repair or rebuild that would have hindered the proprietors from opening their dining room. Therefore, this bedrock requirement for coverage wasn’t satisfied."
