    "body": "At the United Nations General Assembly last week in New York, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian sought to dash the Biden administration’s hopes for a follow-on agreement to President Obama’s nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. “We will not have a so-called longer and stronger deal,” Mr. Amir-Abdollahian declared. He added that to resurrect the 2015 nuclear deal, the Biden administration would have to offer more sanctions relief than the Obama administration did.<br />What is to be done when carrots aren’t working and the administration refuses to use the stick and return to President Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign? President Biden likely will offer even more carrots and pretend that these will slow the development of Iran’s atomic program. This approach—call it “maximum-carrots diplomacy”—is meant primarily to deter covert actions by Israel’s military and intelligence services against Iran, which Jerusalem is committed to expanding, according to my discussions with Israeli officials. Mr. Biden is also wooing Democrats skeptical of the Iran nuclear deal like Sen. Bob Menendez, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee."
