    "body": "Credit Sen. Joe Manchin for this week solving a paradox. What happens when an irresistible progressive force meets an immovable senator? Physicists take note: The West Virginian is still standing.<br />To listen to those progressives and the media, President Biden’s agenda hangs in the balance because Mr. Manchin keeps refusing to say what he “wants.” They deigned to express fury and incredulity at Mr. Manchin’s Wednesday night rejection of their $3.5 trillion entitlement blowout. As our president might say: C’mon! Mr. Manchin has been clear for two solid months now. This pileup is solely the fault of a left that put its fingers in its ears, arrogantly relying on threats."
