    "body": "Since the end of the Civil War, Robert E. Lee’s dignified visage has been the most formidable emblem of the “Lost Cause” tradition, which portrayed the Confederacy’s bid for independence as a noble tragedy rather than a rebellion led by self-interested slaveholders. Lee’s personal probity, his skill on the battlefield and his initial ambivalence about secession have long earned him a favorable judgment in the public imagination—of a kind that, say, Jefferson Davis, the Confederacy’s president, never enjoyed. Lee was easy to admire, even to celebrate, as a man who transcended the ugly realities behind the Confederate cause.<br />In “Robert E. Lee: A Life,” Allen C. Guelzo punctures the Lost Cause mythology without indulging in culture-war polemics, and he examines Lee’s life and moral culpability with a judicious eye. The author of “Gettysburg: The Last Invasion” (2013), an exceptional account of the momentous Civil War battle, Mr. Guelzo acutely judges Lee’s generalship, giving credit where it is due—always in brisk and highly readable prose—but also examining Lee’s often ignored battlefield shortcomings."
