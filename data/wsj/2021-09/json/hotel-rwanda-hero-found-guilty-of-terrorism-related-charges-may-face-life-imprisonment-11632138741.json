    "body": "A Rwandan court convicted Paul Rusesabagina, a U.S. resident immortalized by Hollywood for saving more than 1,200 people during the 1994 genocide, on a string of charges including terrorism and sentenced him to 25 years in prison, effectively ending the activist career of one of President Paul Kagame’s sharpest critics.<br />The 67-year-old recipient of a U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom, who described the trial as politically motivated to silence him, looked solemn as the presiding judge read the verdict in Kigali."
