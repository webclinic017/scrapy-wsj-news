    "body": "WASHINGTON—Sen. Joe Manchin’s cards were laid on the table Thursday. And the centrist Democrat from a solidly Republican, coal-producing state said no one should be surprised at what they showed.<br />“People pretty much know where I’ve been all along,” said the West Virginia lawmaker, whose state went for former President Donald Trump by 39 points in 2020. “I’ve never been a liberal in any way, shape or form. There’s no one that has ever thought I was.”"
