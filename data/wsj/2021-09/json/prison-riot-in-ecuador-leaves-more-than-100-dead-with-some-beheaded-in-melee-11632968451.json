    "body": "More than 100 inmates were killed and dozens more injured in a riot in Ecuador’s coastal city of Guayaquil, officials said, in the latest outbreak in Latin America of violence between gangs fighting for control of a prison.<br />The death toll from one of Ecuador’s most violent prison uprisings rose sharply on Wednesday as officials regained control of the Litoral Penitentiary, one of the city’s main prisons. Clashes between the rival Los Lobos and Los Choneros gangs erupted Tuesday as inmates attacked each other with knives, guns and explosives. Some of the inmates were beheaded, officials said."
