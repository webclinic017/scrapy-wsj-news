    "body": "Like an addict who finally enters rehab, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy has promised to go cold turkey on tax increases. This is not a parody from the Babylon Bee. The most taxing Governor this side of Illinois declared Tuesday in a campaign debate that “I pledge to not raise taxes” in a second term.<br />This conversion on the road back to Trenton was such a shock that the debate moderator literally thought she’d misheard. “Yes, you will raise taxes?” replied ABC’s Sade Baderinwa after Mr. Murphy’s remark. He repeated the no-new-taxes pledge."
