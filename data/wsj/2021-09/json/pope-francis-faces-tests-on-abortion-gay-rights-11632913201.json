    "body": "ROME—Bishops in the U.S. and Germany are poised to challenge Pope Francis, from the right and left respectively, on abortion and gay rights, in tests that could shape the 84-year-old’s legacy.<br />German Catholic bishops and lay leaders are scheduled to vote this week on a proposal for blessing same-sex couples despite a Vatican ban on the practice. In November, U.S. bishops are expected to vote on whether Catholic politicians who support abortion rights, such as President Biden, should be denied Communion, despite a warning from the Vatican that such a statement could be divisive."
