    "body": "The Supreme Court opens its new term Monday with six nominal conservatives appointed by Republican presidents. But conservatives have been shaken in their confidence that those six will yield majorities on issues that deeply matter. That declining confidence comes along with a serious argument within the conservative family over the nature of “conservative jurisprudence.” Conservatives are united in taking as our coordinates the original meaning of the text of the Constitution. But some of us have argued for “a better originalism,” as opposed what we call the “truncated originalism” that has predominated. We see the latter as detached from the understanding that the American Founders, the true originalists, had of the moral ground of the Constitution and laws they were shaping.<br />Having simmered a long time, this argument was heated to a boil by Justice Neil Gorsuch’s opinion in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020). In that case, Justice Gorsuch (joined by Chief Justice John Roberts) broke away from his conservative colleagues on the issue of “transgenderism.” Somehow Justice Gorsuch found that the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in barring discriminations based on sex, also barred discrimination against people who claim that in their own sense of themselves, they had changed the sex marked in them by their organs of reproduction, the structure of their bodies and their hormones."
