    "body": "The Securities and Exchange Commission proposed a rule that would require money managers to disclose more information on how they use their voting power.<br />When investors buy a mutual fund and exchange-traded fund from an asset manager, the money manager votes on shareholder proposals on behalf of the investors. Shareholder votes extend to issues from executive compensation to a companyâ€™s efforts to address climate change."
