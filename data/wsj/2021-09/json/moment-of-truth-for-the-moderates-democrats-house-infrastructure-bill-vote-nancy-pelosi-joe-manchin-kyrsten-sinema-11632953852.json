    "body": "Thursday will be a moment of political truth for swing-state Democrats, as the House prepares to vote on the Senate infrastructure bill as Speaker Nancy Pelosi promised. If the Speaker further delays a vote, or progressive Democrats defeat the bill, the centrists will know they’ve again been played for chumps.<br />Remember the showdown in August when 10 or so Democrats made a show of demanding a vote on the $1 trillion bill that passed the Senate with bipartisan support? The Speaker didn’t give anything on policy, but she did promise a vote by Sept. 27. That skated to Thursday, Sept. 30, but now it isn’t clear the Speaker has the votes to pass it."
