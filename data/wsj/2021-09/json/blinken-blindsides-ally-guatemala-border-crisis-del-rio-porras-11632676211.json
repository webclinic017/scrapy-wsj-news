    "body": "The migration calamity that exploded in the border city of Del Rio, Texas,  this month is the product of bureaucratic incompetence. But Democratic Party politics and progressive ideology have also played big roles in fomenting the crisis.<br />When Democrats were out of power, their denunciations of President Trumpâ€™s border policies sent a message to migrants that asylum-seekers would be welcome if there were a new occupant in the White House. It was a way to rev up the base for the 2020 presidential election. It also helped candidate Joe Biden get buy-in from extremist factions seeking to tear down institutions like private property and the rule of law."
