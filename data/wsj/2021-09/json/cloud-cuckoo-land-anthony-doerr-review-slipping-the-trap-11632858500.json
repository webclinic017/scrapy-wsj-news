    "body": "Tell me a story.<br />Of all our contemporary literary fiction writers, Anthony Doerr is the one whose novels seem to be the purest, most full-hearted response to that primal request. “All the Light We Cannot See” (2014), Mr. Doerr’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel set during World War II, was a hectic network of stories—love stories, war stories, coming-of-age stories, stories of devastation, courage and regret. Like the streets of the model city that the loving father of that novel’s blind heroine constructs so that she can learn to navigate independently, Mr. Doerr’s plotlines ingeniously crisscross and circle back on themselves and abruptly terminate. Naturally, Mr. Doerr’s exaltation of storytelling, along with the Dickensian implausibility and sentimentality of some of the subplots in “All the Light We Cannot See,” earned him sneers from some of the “smarties” (as the poet Stevie Smith tartly dubbed highbrow critics). Wait’ll those smarties get a load of Mr. Doerr’s long-awaited follow-up, “Cloud Cuckoo Land.”"
