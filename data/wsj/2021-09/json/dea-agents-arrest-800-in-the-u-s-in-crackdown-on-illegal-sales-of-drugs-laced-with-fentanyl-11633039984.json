    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”Drug-enforcement agents seized 1.8 million fake pills laced with the synthetic opioid fentanyl and arrested more than 800 people across the U.S. in a two-month crackdown on online sales of the potentially deadly drugs.<br />Law-enforcement officials criticized social-media companies for failing to do more to stop the online sale of a growing number of counterfeit pills that look similar to prescription painkillers but contain sometimes lethal amounts of fentanyl, an opioid that propelled U.S. drug overdose deaths to a record high last year."
