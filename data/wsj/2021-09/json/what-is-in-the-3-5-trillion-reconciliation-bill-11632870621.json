    "body": "Democrats are moving quickly to pass a multi-trillion-dollar spending bill via budget reconciliation, with little scrutiny on the details. So the editorial board has been parsing the bill’s vast new entitlements for readers. Take a turbocharged child tax credit that is really a universal basic income, which will discourage work and cost $1 trillion. Or a paid family and medical leave program that purports to help low-income workers but will subsidize affluent Americans earning north of $200,000 a year. The Journal has also walked readers through the array of accounting fictions that make the bill appear cheaper on paper. The true expense may reach $5.5 trillion over a decade, and much more beyond that. The larger cost will be conditioning the American middle class to rely on government for ever more of life’s needs.<br />President Biden is trying to rescue his $3.5 trillion tax and spend plan by playing the class card, claiming it will help “working people” who are “struggling” to pay the bills. This makes it sound like a safety net program for the poor rather than what it really is: a government subsidy engine for everyone including the affluent."
