    "body": "SINGAPORE—Manufacturers looking to shift production out of China during the U.S.-China trade war piled into Vietnam, attracted by its low wages and the government’s business-friendly reputation.<br />But strict lockdowns to contain a Covid-19 wave in the largely unvaccinated country have crippled manufacturing since July, forcing companies such as  Nike Inc.  and  Lululemon Athletica Inc.  to shift production to other countries. That is prompting some businesses to rethink their heavy reliance on factories in Vietnam."
