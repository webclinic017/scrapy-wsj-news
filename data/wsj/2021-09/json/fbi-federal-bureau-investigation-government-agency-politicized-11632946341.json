    "body": "Holman W. Jenkins, Jr. has raised a question and provided the answer in his column “Abolish the FBI” (Business World, Sept. 22), a brilliant and gutsy synopsis of why the agency has outlived its mandate. But that can be said of a half-dozen agencies that have grown in manpower and budget.<br />Think of the Education Department, begun by President Jimmy Carter, which has overseen the degradation of public education in America. Or the Food and Drug Administration, which has grown so sclerotic that drug approval now requires billions of dollars and 10 years, during which patients in need decline or die. Or a Securities and Exchange Commission that never seems to anticipate or prevent securities frauds. While we’re at it, the State Department hasn’t been effective for the past 100 years."
