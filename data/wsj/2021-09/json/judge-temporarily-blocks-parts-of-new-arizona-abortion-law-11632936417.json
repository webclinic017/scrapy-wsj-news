    "body": "A federal judge temporarily blocked part of a new Arizona law that would have allowed felony charges to be brought against doctors who performed abortions based only on genetic abnormalities like Down syndrome.<br />In an order late Tuesday, hours before the legislation was slated to take effect, U.S. District Judge Douglas Rayes said that section of the Arizona law was likely unconstitutional and would make it more difficult for women seeking abortions due to genetic abnormalities to know their rights."
