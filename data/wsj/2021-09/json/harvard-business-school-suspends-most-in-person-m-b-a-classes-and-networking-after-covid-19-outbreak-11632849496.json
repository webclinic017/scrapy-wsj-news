    "body": "Harvard Business School has moved most of its M.B.A. classes online following a spate of breakthrough Covid-19 infections among its students.<br />The move to remote instruction for all first-year courses and some second-year courses will run until at least Oct. 3, the school said, and comes about a month after the start of classes. It is one of the first instances of a major university halting some in-person instruction this fall and signifies the challenges that schools, which have traditionally attracted students with their in-person teaching and socializing, face as they bring students back."
