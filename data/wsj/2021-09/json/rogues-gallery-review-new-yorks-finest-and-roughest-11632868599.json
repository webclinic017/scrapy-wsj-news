    "body": "Theodore Roosevelt famously revived his sagging political fortunes in the 1890s by setting out to change the culture of policing in New York City. As a member of the police department’s board of commissioners, Roosevelt made it clear that there would be no more beatings, no more payoffs, no more covering up of bad behavior. His reforms would sound familiar to today’s progressives.<br />But, as John Oller notes in “Rogues’ Gallery: The Birth of Modern Policing and Organized Crime in Gilded Age New York,” Roosevelt also brought back the nightstick, the beat cop’s skull-cracking weapon of choice, which had been banned years earlier. “I do not want a policeman to draw his club unless he needs it,” Roosevelt said. But should that need arise, he added, “I want him to have the most efficient club there is.” So much for abolishing the police. Speak softly and, well, you know the rest."
