    "body": "A once senior Chinese law-enforcement official on Thursday was ejected from the Communist Party in a blaze of accusations, an indication that the anticorruption campaign that defined President Xi Jinping’s early years in power is far from over and could pick up pace as he seeks to stay on as leader.<br />Sun Lijun, as vice minister of public security, had wide-ranging connections throughout the legal system, including to a senior Chinese police official who for almost two years was president of Interpol but is now serving a 13-year sentence in China for bribe-taking."
