    "body": "House Democrats were scrambling to come up with the votes to pass the Senate infrastructure bill as we went to press on Thursday. But the bigger news this week is West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin’s declaration of what he won’t accept in the separate $3.5 trillion tax-and-spending bill. Think of this as an intervention to save the Democratic Party, and the country, from the left.<br />Progressives are furious with Mr. Manchin, and with Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, for refusing to go along with the Bernie Sanders entitlement dreamscape. As an act of retribution, they’ve threatened to scuttle the $1 trillion infrastructure bill that the two Democrats negotiated with Republicans."
