    "body": "Under Chancellor Angela Merkel, Germany has played an outsize role in determining the economic and political direction of the European Union. Now, the makeup of a new German government will be critical in deciding a series of key issues, from the area’s post-Covid-19 economic policy to its relations with the U.S., Russia and China.<br />In the coming months, the EU will have to decide whether to loosen budget rules for members, a change that could affect the economic trajectory of the bloc. It is also under pressure from France to establish its own security and defense capabilities, in part in response to the U.S.’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and Washington’s growing focus on Asia."
