    "body": "BRYANT SIMMONS first noticed men wearing necklaces adorned with childlike charms or upbeat beads this summer. A stylist at New York boutique Kirna Zabête, he suddenly saw them on the napes of customers, subway commuters and young trendsetters all across town (not to mention Instagram). So after a bit of research, he decided to buy a rainbow-hued version from the label Anni Lu.<br />“I ended up wearing it with everything. It’s that bit of color and fun that I needed,” he said, noting that it makes simple T-shirts more playful and lends “stuffy” work clothes some personality. He turned to the outfit-energizing accessory “a lot more than I thought I would.”"
