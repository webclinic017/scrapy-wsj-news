    "body": "THE SPRING RITUAL of setting houseplants on your patio or balcony is of course bookended by the autumn rite of bringing them back indoors, where they satisfy the need for green all winter. To prep for the occasion, we tasked Miami interior design pro Travis London with scouring the fall catalogs of a few accessible retailers for the best accessories to integrate your plant habit into your décor. “You want to avoid [creating] a room that feels less like an interior and more like a garden,” said Mr. London. “Plants should add to your design, not take away from it.” Here, his top picks for doing just that.<br />Urban Outfitters  had never struck Mr. London as a source of home décor, he admits, but after looking through its autumn catalog, he’s a fan. “They actually have an eclectic and diverse selection,” he said, singling out this 44-inch-tall, three-story planter as his pick. The staggered cachepots (no hole in the bottom) and spiral-wrapped rattan take the tower’s personality “from ‘Golden Girls’ to a more modern Miami,” joked the Floridian. “This is a rattan for 2021.” To keep the planter from skewing fusty, Mr. London recommends filling it with leafy plants, or even cactuses, in lieu of froufrou florals.
