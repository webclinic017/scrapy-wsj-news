    "body": "SEOUL—Kim Jong Un said the U.S. threat against North Korea remains “utterly unchanged” under President Biden, accusing Washington of using increasingly cunning methods and words.<br />In a policy speech to his rubber-stamp legislature, Mr. Kim didn’t mention or criticize Mr. Biden by name, though specified his assessment was proved by the American deeds done “over the past eight months,” according to a Thursday state-media report of his remarks. The North Korean leader ordered officials to take tactical measures that would firmly protect the country’s sovereignty."
