    "body": "FOR THE UNINITIATED attempting to use Instagram’s “Reels” tool can feel a bit like learning how to ride a bike—on a tightrope, wearing a parakeet on your head, while everyone you know tunes in to watch you wobble. “The minute we master something on Instagram we’re thrown something new that we have to learn how to do,” said Jean Liu, a Dallas interior designer. Launched in August 2020, the feature lets users share videos of up to 60 seconds—similar to TikToks, or sometimes blatant reposts from that platform—on their feeds. Ms. Liu attempted to post her first solo Reel in June, in which she panned over clay tile samples. But she took it down within minutes after realizing she forgot to add tunes. “Even now, I don’t really know how to do that,” she said.<br />Still, Ms. Liu said she would be hopping back onto the Reels saddle because her business relies on ballooning her audience. “Each time we take a prospective client call, we ask, ‘How did you find us?’ and the answer most of the time is, ‘I found you on Instagram,’” she said. The pressure is on to master Reels, which these days, said the platform’s Reels Product Director, Tessa Lyons-Laing, is “the largest contributor to engagement growth.”"
