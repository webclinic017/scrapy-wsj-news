    "body": "On the day before California’s gubernatorial recall election, former President Donald Trump declared that the vote would be “rigged” for the Democrats. The next day, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom prevailed by 25 percentage points—a margin of victory that surely falls beyond what rigging could achieve.<br />Mr. Trump—who began proclaiming he was the victim of vote fraud way back when he claimed Republican Sen. Ted Cruz stole the Iowa caucuses in 2016—also has dismissed the findings of a vote recount in Maricopa County, Ariz., financed by his own supporters, which confirmed President Biden’s victory there. Meantime, Trump supporters have even claimed vote fraud in Alabama—a state where all top officials are Republicans and Mr. Trump won by more than 25 percentage points."
