    "body": "It’s a rare occasion when the Biden administration decides to continue any policy put in place by President Trump, and the most notorious example is the botched Afghanistan withdrawal. The latest cause for alarm: The Biden team plans on Oct. 5 to auction off one of the last available bands of government-controlled spectrum in the electromagnetic midband, the extremely valuable “sweet spot” of 5G.<br />Next week’s auction was set in motion by Mr. Trump’s Federal Communications Commission, which had to comply with a provision buried in a Covid relief bill. The three giant companies that dominate the U.S. wireless industry are happy with these auctions. They have deep pockets and can borrow money to outbid smaller competitors."
