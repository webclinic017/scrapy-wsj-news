    "body": "OBSCENE WEALTH. Family drama. Scandals galore. HBO’s series “Succession,” whose third season kicks off on Oct. 17, has given viewers plenty to talk about since its 2018 premiere. But no secret relationship or corporate coverup has captivated us quite like the metamorphosis of Siobhan “Shiv” Roy. Over the course of two seasons, Shiv—mogul Logan Roy’s only daughter—has gone from softly tressed progressive to blunt-bobbed power player, abandoning her political career to pursue the Waystar Royco throne. And costume designer Michelle Matland made sure her wardrobe echoed that shift.<br />In Season 1, Shiv (Sarah Snook) adhered to softly hued workwear (often Theory) and Veronica-Lake-esque hair that provided a visual counterpoint to other characters’ hard edges. Her aesthetic was approachable but pulled-together; aspirational but attainable. It made sense, Ms. Matland said, that a character working for a politician would underplay her impossible wealth."
