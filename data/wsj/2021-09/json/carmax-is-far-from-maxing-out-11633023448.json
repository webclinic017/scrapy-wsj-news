    "body": "The chip shortage is turning out to be a gift that just keeps giving for the used-car business. But it still doesn’t come free.<br />Used-car seller  CarMax  on Thursday said sales in its quarter ended Aug. 31 grew 48.7% compared with a year earlier, hitting a record of $8 billion, exceeding analyst expectations. Strong pricing for used vehicles, driven by continued delays to new-car manufacturing from the global chip shortage, continues to boost the company’s top line. Average retail selling prices were up 30.8% compared with a year earlier."
