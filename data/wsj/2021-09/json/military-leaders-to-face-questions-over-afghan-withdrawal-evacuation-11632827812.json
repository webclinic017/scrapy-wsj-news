    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Pentagon’s top military officer called the evacuation of Americans, Afghans and allies out of Kabul in the final weeks of the nation’s longest war a “logistical success but a strategic failure,” during a contentious Senate hearing Tuesday in which some Republicans said he should resign.<br />Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee grilled Army Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, along with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and U.S. Central Command commander Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie about the withdrawal from Afghanistan. Lawmakers asked about the generals’ recommendations to President Biden on troop numbers and whether U.S. security and prestige were damaged by leaving the country, especially in light of how the exit unfolded."
