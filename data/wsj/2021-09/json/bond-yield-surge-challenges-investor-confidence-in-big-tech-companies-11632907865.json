    "body": "A swift rise in government-bond yields is hitting shares of technology stalwarts that have powered major indexes higher for years, testing investors’ faith in some of the stock market’s most popular trades.<br />Even though this week’s slide moderated on Wednesday, shares of software giant  Microsoft Corp. , Google parent  Alphabet Inc .  and chip maker  Nvidia Corp.  have fallen about 5%  or more so far this week, dragging down major indexes and equity funds that give companies with large market values greater influence. Together with Apple Inc.,  Amazon.com Inc . ,  Facebook Inc .  and  Netflix Inc . , the seven companies lost about $315 billion in market value Tuesday, the largest slide since last October, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 inched up 0.2% Wednesday but is still down 3.6% in September and on track for its largest monthly decline in a year."
