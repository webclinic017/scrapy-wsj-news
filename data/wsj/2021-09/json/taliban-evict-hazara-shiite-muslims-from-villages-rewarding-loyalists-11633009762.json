    "body": "KABUL—The Taliban have displaced hundreds of families belonging to Afghanistan’s Shiite Hazara community in central Afghanistan, reinforcing fears of renewed persecution against a minority that suffered under Taliban rule in the past.<br />The evictions this week in the Gizab district of Uruzgan province follow warnings from the Taliban earlier this month to residents of Kindir and Tagabdar villages that they had nine days to leave their homes. Some 700 Hazara families, representing thousands of people, complied with the Taliban order and fled, according to residents."
