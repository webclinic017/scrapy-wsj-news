    "body": "Americans are worried about inflation. This was the No. 1 economic concern expressed in a recent survey from the Pew Research Center. Some 63% say they are “very concerned” about rising prices, especially for food and consumer goods, compared with only 29% who are very concerned that Americans won’t be able to find work.<br />This focus on higher prices is easy to explain. Consumer inflation is running above 5%, wiping out nominal wage gains for low-income workers. The Labor Department reports that businesses investing in their long-term production capacity are facing the largest price hikes since 1982."
