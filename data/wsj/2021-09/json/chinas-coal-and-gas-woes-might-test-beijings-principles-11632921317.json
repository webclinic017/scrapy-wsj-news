    "body": "American and European energy users are nervously eyeing low natural gas inventories as colder weather approaches. Northeast Asia might find its heating bills skyrocketing this winter too. The global gas shortage is one factor, but there is a bigger one closer to home.<br />China’s latest efforts to improve conditions in its dangerous, fragmented coal mining industry have contributed to weak supply growth and skyrocketing coal prices. This has also spilled over into the liquefied natural gas market. The situation is reminiscent of late 2016, when a recovering Chinese economy collided with government mine closures, resulting in an enormous coal price spike."
