    "body": "Restaurant expenses are surging. But a healthy consumer appetite suggests that restaurant stock prices might soon catch up.<br />It is no secret that restaurant operators, who earn low profit margins in the best of times, face a challenging environment. Supply disruptions in key inputs such as food and labor have driven prices higher and left many eateries understaffed. Even restaurants that do have enough workers are liable to experience sudden, temporary staff shortages from Covid-19 quarantines. If that werenâ€™t enough, the spread of the Delta variant has crimped interest in dining out for certain customers, although capacity restrictions and other lockdown measures seem to be policies of the past."
