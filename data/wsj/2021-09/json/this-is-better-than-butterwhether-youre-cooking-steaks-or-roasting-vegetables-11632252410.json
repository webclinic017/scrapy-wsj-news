    "body": "IT’S HARD TO pinpoint just when ghee was invented, but the why is pretty clear. Ghee is butter that has been heated and clarified—that is, had its milk solids and water removed to produce pure butterfat. This gives it a long shelf life, a virtue in its native India where hot temperatures can quickly turn butter rancid.<br />Ghee has remained popular, even revered—and for good reason. During the clarification process, when the butter is cooked, the milk solids begin to caramelize, giving ghee a nutty flavor. This makes it ideal to fry an egg in, stir into rice or drizzle over roasted vegetables. And when the butter is strained to remove the solids, it obtains a tremendously high smoke point, around 485 degrees—more than 100 degrees higher than that of ordinary butter—which sets the stage for a steakhouse worthy rib-eye."
