    "body": "SEOUL—North Korea has launched at least one short-range missile off its east coast, South Korea’s military said, as Pyongyang turns back to weapons tests with greater frequency amid a stall in nuclear talks with the U.S.<br />The missile was launched around 6:40 a.m. local time on Tuesday, before splashing into the waters between Korea and Japan, said South Korea’s military, which had detected a single projectile. The precise type of weapon—including if it was a ballistic missile—and the distance flown weren’t immediately shared by South Korea’s military."
