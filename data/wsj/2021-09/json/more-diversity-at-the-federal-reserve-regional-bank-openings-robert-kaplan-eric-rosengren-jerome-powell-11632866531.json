    "body": "The Federal Reserve has been embarrassed this week by the resignation of two regional bank presidents after news of their stock trades. But the open seats are also an opportunity to bring some much-needed intellectual diversity to the central bank’s policy deliberations.<br />Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Dallas President Robert Kaplan resigned abruptly on Monday, after reports that they had engaged in investment trading while running the regional banks. The trading (which showed up on disclosure forms) wasn’t a hanging offense by our lights, though the two men clearly hadn’t thought enough about appearances in this age of public mistrust."
