    "body": "For more than 16 months, the U.S. and Canada turned away tourists at entry points across the 5,500-mile land border in an effort to contain further spread of Covid-19. On Monday, Aug. 9, Canada began allowing fully vaccinated Americans to enter the country again. The U.S. didnâ€™t reciprocate, and on Sept. 20 said it would extend its land border restrictions with Canada and Mexico until Oct. 21. On Tuesday Sept. 7, Canada expanded its reopening to include fully vaccinated tourists from other countries beyond the U.S.<br />If you are a fully vaccinated American citizen or a green-card holder living in the U.S., the answer is likely yes. As of Aug. 9, fully vaccinated Americans who meet other Canadian government criteria can enter Canada for nonessential purposes such as tourism and recreation."
