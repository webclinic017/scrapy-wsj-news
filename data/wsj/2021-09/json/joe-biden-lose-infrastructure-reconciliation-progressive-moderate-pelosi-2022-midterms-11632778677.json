    "body": "Who says bipartisan consensus isn’t possible in today’s Washington?<br />Right now the Beltway consensus is that this is a make-or-break week for Joe Biden. The goal is getting the House to pass a $1 trillion infrastructure bill (already approved by the Senate), and getting both the House and Senate to agree to the $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill that is the vehicle for Mr. Biden’s Build Back Better agenda. This consensus is bipartisan: From Nancy Pelosi and Kevin McCarthy to Chuck Schumer and Mitch McConnell, all understand that if Congress doesn’t send both these bills to Mr. Biden’s desk for his signature, the Biden presidency will be cooked."
