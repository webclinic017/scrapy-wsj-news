    "body": "When a movie is notably short for its genre, it can be a sign that the elements have been honed to perfection (the best example being “Dr. Strangelove,” which runs 95 minutes) or that the filmmakers couldn’t work up enough material to make it longer. The latter would seem to be the case with Marvel’s “Venom: Let There Be Carnage,” a less-than-100-minute follow-up, playing in theaters, to the 2018 “Venom,” which, clocking in at 112 minutes, was on the short side for a superhero epic to being with.<br />In that one Tom Hardy played a hapless TV reporter, Eddie Brock, who becomes an unwilling host to an alien protector called Venom, a tentacled symbiote with uncouth habits and a subwoofer voice. Eddie and his alter ego are back in the sequel, which is silly and chaotic. Yet the wonder of it all is that the silliness and chaos won’t matter in the slightest to young, mostly male moviegoers who have been waiting eagerly for the much-delayed film to arrive. (And for news of whether, in the era of crossover comic-book heroes, Spider-Man will be in it—on that count my lips are sealed.)"
