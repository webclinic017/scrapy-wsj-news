    "body": "Worker filings for unemployment benefits are expected to have fallen last week as the number of Covid-19 cases declined and hurricane-related disruptions eased.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimate that initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, declined by 16,000 to a seasonally adjusted 335,000 for the week ended Sept. 25. That would place new applications near the lowest level since the pandemic took hold in the U.S. in March 2020. The Labor Department plans to release the latest numbers at 8:30 a.m. EDT Thursday."
