    "body": "OPEN THE luxuriously blue leather-bound “Notes on Entertaining,” published by Smythson of Bond Street, British stationer to the Queen, and you might feel as if you’ve traveled back in time to a more gracious era of home entertainment. Offering a charming mix of simple line illustrations and imaginative advice on how to entertain at home with flair, author Fiona Leahy manages to channel the spirit of the 1950s, when a post-war boom in home ownership created something of a cocktail- and dinner-party renaissance.<br />While Ms. Leahy’s advice is thoroughly modern, “Notes on Entertaining” reminded us of another book, written almost 70 years ago. Despite its title, “Amy Vanderbilt’s Complete Book of Etiquette,” first published in 1952, was much more than a persnickety encyclopedia of pinky-out formalities. Offering advice on everything from how to pull off a formal dinner to dealing with a living-room lout, Amy Vanderbilt’s guide taught “martooni”-era America how to entertain at home with style and polish. (Fun fact: Its diagrams came courtesy of Andy Warhol, in his pre-Pop Art incarnation as a commercial illustrator for hire.)"
