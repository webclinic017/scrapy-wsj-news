    "body": "”Democrats Face Harsh Legislative Reality Check,” said a banner at the bottom of an MSNBC program this afternoon. The political left, which includes numerous MSNBC employees, is struggling to understand why an unpopular and unbelievable president with a 50-50 Senate and a closely divided House cannot easily enact a multitrillion-dollar spending increase crafted by a Vermont socialist.<br />Determined to avoid the obvious, media folk have gone in search of alternative explanations. Meanwhile many so-called progressives have decided they can be most helpful by taking to social media to insult Sens. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) for their reluctance to hit up taxpayers for an extra $3,500,000,000,000. From the amount of vitriol hurled at the two senators on Twitter you’d think they’d just broken up with Taylor Swift."
