    "body": "The House tax package would hit privately held companies twice as hard as publicly traded C corporations. It would impose marginal rates of 46.4% or more on the former, while taxing the latter as little as 26.5%. No business structure can survive such an imbalance, so the net effect would be to encourage further economic consolidation away from Main Street and toward Wall Street.<br />Why should policy makers care? Because private companies are where the jobs are. A new study from EY demonstrates that private companies supply the vast majority of business-sector jobs nationallyâ€”77% of them. Public companies supply only 23%. As important, private-company employment is spread evenly across the country while public-company jobs tend to be concentrated in a few cities and states. The Democratic bill would accelerate the decline of less-prosperous regions."
