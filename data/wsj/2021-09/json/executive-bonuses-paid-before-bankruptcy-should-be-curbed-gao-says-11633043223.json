    "body": "Businesses in financial distress paid out $165 million in executive retention bonuses before filing bankruptcy in the last fiscal year, according to a government watchdog report recommending that Congress require court oversight of such awards.<br />The retention bonuses were paid to 223 executives from 42 companies months or in some instances just days before the businesses they led filed for chapter 11, the Government Accountability Office said Thursday. Paying bonuses before a chapter 11 filing means those awards generally avoid scrutiny from bankruptcy judges, who must follow tough rules restricting executive awards paid once a corporate chapter 11 case begins."
