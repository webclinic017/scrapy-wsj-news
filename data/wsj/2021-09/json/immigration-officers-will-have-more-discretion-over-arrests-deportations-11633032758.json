    "body": "WASHINGTON—Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is revising guidelines governing which immigrants in the country illegally should be targets for arrest or deportation, to give U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers more discretion following complaints from ICE officers and some Republicans that the Biden administration’s initial approach was too restrictive.<br />Under the new set of guidelines, which will become effective in 60 days, ICE officers would have the latitude to decide which immigrants pose a public-safety threat, rather than follow strict categories the administration put in place earlier this year making only immigrants who have committed aggravated felonies—a term used in immigration law that captures some of the most severe crimes, including murder, rape and human trafficking—eligible for arrest or deportation."
