    "body": "The troubles engulfing Chinese property developer Evergrande have prompted comparisons to the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008.<br />Analysts doubt a replay of the contagion that followed Lehman’s collapse is about to happen in China’s more tightly controlled financial system.

Evergrande is struggling because China is trying to pivot away from a model of economic growth inordinately dependent on debt."
