    "body": "<br />Even in the midst of a frenetic year of news, it’s been hard to miss the headlines about statues coming down in cities and on college campuses around the country.

Among the noteworthy books our reviewers highlight this season are reconsiderations of some of the figures—and flashpoints—that still define (and sometimes divide) America and Americans."
