    "body": "Can the Quad contain China? Last week the leaders of the four nations that make up the informal grouping—the U.S., Japan, India and Australia—met for the first time in person at the White House. A few years ago, when tiptoeing around Chinese sensibilities was more of a global norm, such a gathering would have been almost unimaginable.<br />It’s too soon to say whether the Quad will achieve its unstated goal: stopping an authoritarian China from becoming Asia’s undisputed hegemon. But the four nations have signed on to an ambitious strategy, spanning cooperation on vaccines, infrastructure and technology, designed to blunt Beijing’s challenge. Taken together with the new Aukus military pact among the U.S., the U.K., and Australia and a thickening web of bilateral agreements across the region, these initiatives signal clear intent to combat Beijing."
