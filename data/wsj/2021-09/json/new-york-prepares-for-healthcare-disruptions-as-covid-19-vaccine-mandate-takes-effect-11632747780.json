    "body": "New York state’s healthcare system is bracing for staff shortages this week as a vaccine mandate took effect at midnight on Monday, presenting the largest test case so far of how similar requirements will play out across the country.<br />The mandate was beginning amid legal uncertainty for similar vaccine requirements in the state. A federal appeals court late Monday reversed an action that blocked a vaccine mandate for New York City’s public school workers."
