    "body": "Decades after their deaths, designers Charles and Ray Eames—widely considered the godparents of midcentury-modern furniture—find themselves in a position more common to basketball titans like Michael Jordan: A sneaker now bears their name. The shoe is a nothing-to-it version of Reebok’s low top Club C sneaker with “Eames” embossed on the side in poppy colors recalling their Los Angeles home’s exterior. It’s the first product of a year-and-a-half-long collaboration between Reebok and Eames Office, the foundation that handles the pair’s work and legacy.<br />Eames fans will be frustrated to discover they can’t buy this shoe. It’s a limited “friends and family” giveaway (though based on how frequently this sneaker is showing up on my Instagram feed, Reebok sure has a lot of friends). Leo Gamboa, the project manager at Reebok who led the collaboration, said other models will follow, channeling some of the Eames’ best-known furniture designs from “the colors to the stitching.”"
