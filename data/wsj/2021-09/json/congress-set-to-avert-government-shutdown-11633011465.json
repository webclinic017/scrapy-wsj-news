    "body": "WASHINGTON—Congress passed a bill extending government funding through Dec. 3, sending the legislation to President Biden’s desk hours before current funding expires and completing one of several pressing measures before lawmakers.<br />Both the House and Senate provided bipartisan support for the bill, which also includes $28.6 billion in emergency disaster aid and $6.3 billion to help resettle Afghan evacuees. The bill passed 65-35 in the Senate, and 254 to 175 a few hours later in the House."
