Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) said Tuesday she would oppose a second term for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell if President Biden nominates the central bank leader, highlighting the intraparty divide over his candidacy.<br />Ms. Warren told Mr. Powell during a congressional hearing that his effort to loosen financial regulations imposed after the 2008 financial crisis “makes you a dangerous man to head up the Fed.”"
