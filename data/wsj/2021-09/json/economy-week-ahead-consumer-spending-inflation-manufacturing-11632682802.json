    "body": "The Commerce Department’s monthly report on U.S. consumer spending highlights this week’s economic data.<br />New orders for durable goods in the U.S. are expected to increase in August as business investment and consumer spending remain positive. While demand for factory goods has been strong through the pandemic recovery, manufacturers have been constrained by shortages of parts and labor, transportation bottlenecks and rising material costs."
