    "body": "WASHINGTON—A crucial piece of President Biden’s domestic agenda hung in the balance Thursday, as Democratic leaders moved toward a planned House vote on a $1 trillion infrastructure bill that many progressive Democrats have threatened to oppose.<br />Congress did appear poised to avert a government shutdown, with the Senate and then the House expected to easily approve a measure extending government funding through Dec. 3. Without passage of that bill, funding would expire and a partial government shutdown would begin at 12:01 a.m. EDT Friday."
