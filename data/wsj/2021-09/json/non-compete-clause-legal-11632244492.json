    "body": "Many executives in the U.S. have noncompete clauses in their employment contracts that prevent them from working for a competitor or starting a competing business for a certain period after leaving their current employer.<br />One study estimates that about 64% of executives employed in publicly listed companies in the U.S. are bound by such agreements. Whether such policies are good for the economy, however, is a matter of debate."
