    "body": "IN “THE WHITE LOTUS,” which aired over the summer on HBO Max, the lush location—the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea—serves as an idyllic backdrop for spoiled visitors to play out a dream vacation, beleaguered staff be damned. Now another season has been greenlit, and creator Mike White has said his satirical series will be set at another property in the fictional White Lotus resort group with a new cast—all still under wraps.<br />We asked five other imaginative screenwriters where they’d enjoy seeing the next season set. “It should be someplace equally photogenic—part of the show’s appeal was seeing where the hyper-rich hang out,” said Theresa Rebeck, Broadway playwright who scripted the globe-trotting action movie “The 355,” due out in January 2022."
