    "body": "THE PROMISE of reality television is that we can see folks like us on screen. But sometimes I tune in and wonder if I’m watching an alternate reality. Take British dating competition “Love Island,” a world-wide hit for its eye candy, drama and indecipherable accents. Its contestants are all implausibly attractive singles, the men possessed of a particularly hyperbolic look: Both hyper-tan and hyper-fit, they also boast hyper-white teeth and hyper-coiffed hair, like a Ken doll from Essex. It’s enough to make you ask: Are they doing too much grooming, or am I not doing enough?<br />Typically low maintenance, I wondered what might happen if I primped like these men for a week. So I enlisted two Season 7 contestants—Jake Cornish, 24, a water engineer from Weston-super-Mare, U.K.; and Brad McClelland, 26, a laborer from Amble, U.K.—to guide me."
