    "body": "The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to referee a dispute between the Federal Election Commission and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz over his bid to be fully reimbursed for a loan he made to his reelection campaign in 2018, one of five new cases the court added to its docket for its coming term.<br />Mr. Cruz, a Republican, lent his campaign $260,000 the day before the general election in which he narrowly defeated Democratic candidate Beto Oâ€™Rourke. But under federal campaign-finance limits, there is a $250,000 cap on a candidate being reimbursed for personal loans with money his campaign receives after the election."
