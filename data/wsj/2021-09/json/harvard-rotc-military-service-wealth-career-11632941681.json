    "body": "Regarding Ruth Wisse’s op-ed “Afghanistan Was Lost in the Halls of Harvard” (Sept. 21): If colleges were graded by how they encourage students to value their country and serve something bigger than themselves, Harvard would fail. The school paid lip service to military service by reinstating ROTC and offering a few military-focused courses, but its ingrained traits and habits undermine these offerings.<br />I’m a 2020 Harvard graduate and active-duty naval intelligence officer. When I would tell someone at Harvard about my military future, almost all would be shocked. “Was this your only option?” they sometimes asked. As if my decision were an act of desperation, not a conscious choice."
