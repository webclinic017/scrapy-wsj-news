    "body": "The Federal Trade Commission finished hearing testimony last week in its administrative proceeding aimed at forcing a genomics-sequencing company,  Illumina ,  to reverse its recent acquisition of a startup whose blood test can detect many early-stage cancers.<br />Ordinarily, this is an acquisition the FTC would approve. The decision to challenge Illumina indicates a radically different approach to antitrust that will prove suffocating."
