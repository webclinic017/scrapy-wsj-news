    "body": "“Climbing Steel Costs Press Manufacturers” (Business & Finance, Sept. 16) correctly notes that tariffs on imported steel are contributing to the higher prices confronting makers of a wide range of goods, but it largely omits the extent of this contribution and understates the tariffs’ damaging effects on the economy.<br />Steel-price rises are destroying jobs in steel-using industries. More than 12 million Americans are employed in these industries, with about two million of them employed in steel-intensive industries. In 2019 a Federal Reserve study estimated that increased steel-input costs due to the tariffs cost 75,000 Americans their jobs. It is reasonable to conclude that this job-killing trend has continued in the two years since the study was released. And these job losses don’t include additional American export-related jobs lost due to the retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries."
