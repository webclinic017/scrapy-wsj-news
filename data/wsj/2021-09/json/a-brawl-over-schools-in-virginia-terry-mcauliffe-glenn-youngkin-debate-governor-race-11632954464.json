    "body": "Virginiaâ€™s race for Governor in November could be a bellwether for the national midterm elections next year, and one emerging fault line is over school choice and whether parents have a say in the public-school curriculum.<br />The divide widened Tuesday night in an illuminating way. Democrat Terry McAuliffe is all-in with union control and made clear what he thinks of parental choice when his opponent brought up parents who objected to sexually explicit books in Fairfax County school libraries."
