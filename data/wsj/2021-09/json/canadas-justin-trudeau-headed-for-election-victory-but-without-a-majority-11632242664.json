    "body": "OTTAWA—Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fell short on his gambit of capturing a parliamentary majority in national elections and now faces demands from a left-wing rival party to shore up healthcare spending and raise taxes on the wealthy.<br />The preliminary results from Monday’s election indicate Canadians have reservations about the prime minister that include a record of ethical breaches and his decision to hold a snap vote during the Covid-19 pandemic. But the results also suggest voters weren’t enamored with Mr. Trudeau’s rivals, as opposition parties made no discernible gains relative to the 2019 election."
