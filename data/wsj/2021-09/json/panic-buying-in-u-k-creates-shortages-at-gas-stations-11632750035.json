    "body": "LONDON—The British government is searching for drivers to deliver fuel to gas stations across the country after panic buying over the weekend left long lines of customers waiting to fill their tanks.<br />The Covid-19 pandemic and the U.K.’s departure from the European Union have resulted in a shortage of tanker drivers to ferry fuel across the country. Panic buying started last week after media reports that a handful of gas stations had to close because of dwindling supplies."
