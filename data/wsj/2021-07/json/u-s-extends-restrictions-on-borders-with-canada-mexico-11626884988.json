    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. has extended its border restrictions with Canada and Mexico for another month as the Delta variant surges across the U.S. and the vaccination rate lags behind the Biden administration’s goal.<br />U.S. border crossings with Canada and Mexico will remain closed to nonessential travel through Aug. 21, according to documents published by the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday.<br />The U.S. has renewed these restrictions monthly since March 2020 in conjunction with the Canadian and Mexican governments. But July’s extension marks the first time the governments weren’t in lockstep.<br />On Monday, Canada said it would allow fully vaccinated Americans to visit Canada beginning on Aug. 9, with plans to welcome other nationalities beginning in September.<br />The country made the unilateral decision after its vaccination rate surpassed that of the U.S. Nearly 52% of Canadians are fully vaccinated, according to the University of Oxford’s Our World in Data. In the U.S., 48% of the population is fully vaccinated."
