    "body": "WASHINGTON—Tens of millions of U.S. households can expect to see their bank balances grow Thursday, thanks to the first monthly payments of the expanded child tax credit.<br />The Internal Revenue Service issued families payments of up to $300 per child under a program aimed at combating child poverty and turning lump-sum annual tax refunds into predictable household income. The Biden administration said it paid about $15 billion, mostly through direct deposits, to families with nearly 60 million children. Those monthly payments will continue through December, and Congress is debating whether to continue them.<br />Congress expanded the credit by about $100 billion as part of the March coronavirus relief law. The credit had been worth up to $2,000 for children age 16 years and under. Now, it is worth $3,000 for children age 6 to 17 and $3,600 for those under 6.<br />The expanded portion of the payments starts shrinking once income reaches $75,000 for an individual and $150,000 for a married couple. Households above those levels still get the $2,000 credit, which retains the prior income phaseouts starting at $200,000 for individuals and $400,000 for married couples.<br />The credit also is now fully refundable, which means low-income families qualify even if they don’t owe income taxes. Before this year, just $1,400 of the $2,000 was refundable."
