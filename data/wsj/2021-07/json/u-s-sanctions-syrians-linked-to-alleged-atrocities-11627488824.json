    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. Treasury Department levied sanctions against five senior Syrian security officials and eight prisons accused of committing human-rights abuses, the start of what the Biden administration says will be its campaign to hold the Assad regime accountable for war crimes.<br />Wednesday’s action targets intelligence officials the U.S. says are involved in the kidnapping, killing and torture of Syrians opposed to the regime in a decadelong civil war that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives.<br />The Treasury Department also sanctioned Syrian opposition militia Ahrar al-Sharqiya and two of its leaders for alleged abductions, torture and killings, including that of a top Kurdish politician that United Nations officials said was a possible war crime.<br />Syria’s mission to the U.N. didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />Andrea Gacki, director of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, said the sanctions are meant to promote accountability and demonstrate the U.S.’s “strong commitment to targeting human-rights abuses in Syria, regardless of the perpetrator.”"
