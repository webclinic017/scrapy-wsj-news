    "body": "Regarding “Deb Haaland’s Oil and Gas Stall” (Review & Outlook, July 24): The “keep it in the ground” crowd is still trying to reduce fossil-fuel consumption by making it harder to drill and transport. This makes no sense. They are not going to keep it in the ground throughout the world. They are simply making energy more expensive within the U.S. and putting Americans out of work. The methods of transport substituted for pipelines are also more dangerous to the environment. If you really want to curb demand for oil and gas via higher costs, then have the guts to impose gas or carbon taxes. Limiting U.S. supply is more harmful to the environment, not less.<br />Peter A.
