    "body": "Sleep-away camp is a carefree place where kids can escape from the pressures of the school year and, perhaps more important, a place that lets Mom and Dad escape from their kids.<br />But a group of well-heeled parents had to pick up their children just six days into the session after economic reality intruded on their summer idyll. Camp Quinebarge in rural New Hampshire was rated “Best Sleepaway Summer Camp in New York and New England” by New York Family Magazine, according to its website. A full summer session costs $9,800.<br />Despite the price tag, campers allegedly were served undercooked food and didn’t receive enough supervision. A child was bruised in a fight, according to a parent.<br />Hiring counselors was difficult and several who got the job “ghosted” the camp. Others left or were dismissed as the summer began. So was a cook who reportedly served mostly raw meat. Meanwhile, food supplier  Sysco ,  facing its own staffing and logistical issues, informed the camp of food delivery delays that would continue “indefinitely.” Oh, and the dishwasher broke—good luck getting that fixed or replaced these days—so kids ate off dirty plates.<br />It wasn’t quite Lord of the Flies, much less Camp Crystal Lake, but it gave everyone involved memories they will have forever of inflation, labor shortages, logistical snafus, and other modern day economic nightmares."
