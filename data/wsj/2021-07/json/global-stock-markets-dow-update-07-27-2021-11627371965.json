    "body": "U.S. stock futures ticked lower Tuesday as investors awaited earnings reports from the biggest technology giants and data on the manufacturing sector.<br />Futures tied the S&P 500 index edged down 0.3% while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures weakened 0.4%. That suggests that both indexes will retreat from record closing levels at the market open and potentially bring a five-day streak of gains to a halt. Contracts on the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 lost 0.1%.<br />U.S. stocks have largely been grinding higher as investors cheered strong corporate results and upbeat guidance from some of the largest American businesses. At the same time, concerns are lingering over the Delta-variant of Covid-19, supply-chain problems, a spike in inflation and cooling economic growth.<br />“We’ve been characterizing this market as a jetliner that has lifted off and is coming out of the Covid-19 air pocket, but is still trying to find an appropriate cruising altitude,” said Kara Murphy, chief investment officer at Kestra Holdings. “We are seeing economic data going from great levels to good levels: that is still indicative of economic growth.”<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked down to 1.256% from 1.276% on Monday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions."
