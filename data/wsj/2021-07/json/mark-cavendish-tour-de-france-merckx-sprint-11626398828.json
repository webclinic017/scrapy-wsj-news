    "body": "In the moments after yet another stage victory at this Tour de France, Mark Cavendish offered a surprising assessment of how much work he had actually put in.<br />With 120 miles in his legs and sweat pouring off his face, Cavendish shrugged. “I didn’t really do anything there,” he said. “I did 150 meters.”<br />Those 150 meters put him one step closer to breaking what had previously seemed like pro cycling’s untouchable record. Cavendish now has 34 stage victories at the Tour de France, tying the all-time great Eddy Merckx. And in one of the most stunning sports stories of the summer, Cavendish now has two chances—a flat stage on Friday, and Sunday’s finale on the Champs-Élysées—to surpass Merckx before the Tour ends in Paris.<br />To understand how a distance shorter than two city blocks can make legends in a sport where courses stretch over hundreds of miles, you first have to understand that Cavendish isn’t a normal Tour de France rider. Cavendish is a sprinter.<br />That means two things. The first is that he’s slightly crazy—you would have to be to dash for the line at more than 40 miles per hour on a bicycle while rubbing shoulders with your rivals."
