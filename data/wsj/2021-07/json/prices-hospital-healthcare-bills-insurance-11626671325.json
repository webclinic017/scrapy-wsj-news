    "body": "New federal rules requiring price disclosures by hospitals appear to have improved transparency, which is important for any market-based healthcare system (“Hospitals Often Bill Uninsured the Highest Prices,” Page One, July 7). How can patients make an informed choice if they don’t know each hospital’s pricing?<br />The expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies put more taxpayer dollars in the hands of insurers and hospitals, but they address the root issue of inadequate competition only temporarily. Mergers and acquisitions have whittled away at patient choices and given hospitals and insurers more leverage over patients, resulting in skyrocketing costs.<br />It is ironic that government rules were needed to clear the way for a freer market, but competition is sorely needed. Patients should credit the Trump administration’s hospital-price-transparency rule for fairer costs.<br />John Lin<br />Providence, R.I."
