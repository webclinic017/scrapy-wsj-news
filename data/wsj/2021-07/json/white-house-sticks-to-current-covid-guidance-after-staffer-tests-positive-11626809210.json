    "body": "WASHINGTON—The White House signaled no changes to its Covid-19 guidance for Americans or safety measures for President Biden after a vaccinated staffer tested positive for the virus and as cases continue to rise nationwide.<br />The White House said Tuesday that its staffer tested positive for Covid-19 after being tested outside of the White House campus. The staffer, whom the White House said is experiencing mild symptoms, is awaiting confirmatory testing. The White House Medical Unit determined that the individual had no close contact with White House senior officials and staff, according to the White House.<br />Asked if the incident should prompt changes to protocols to better protect the president and senior staff from the virus, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters, “Our protocols are in alignment with the highest standards and the guidance of our public health experts.”<br />Mr. Biden is tested once every two weeks and staffers who spend the most time with the president are tested twice a week, Ms. Psaki said.<br />“While breakthrough cases will happen, the vaccines are effective to protect against serious illness and death,” Ms. Psaki said, referring to cases among people who are fully vaccinated."
