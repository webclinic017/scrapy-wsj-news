    "body": "Aharon Friedman and Stephan Miran’s “The Inflation Tax on Capital” (op-ed, July 19) nicely illustrates the randomness of the effective capital-gains tax rates caused by inflation. Even if the legislated rates are progressive, a high-income taxpayer may still pay a lower effective rate on real capital gains than would a lower-income taxpayer if the latter held an asset during a long inflationary period.<br />The capital-gains tax can also exacerbate losses. Imagine you had a $100,000 portfolio of assets intended for a down payment in May 2020. You decided to put it in a very conservative portfolio that earned you only 4% over the year. Since inflation in that period was 5.4%, you can no longer afford the same basket of goods. Yet the IRS will still tax the $4,000 you “gained,” deepening your losses. These distortions should stop. Social Security is indexed, and so are tax brackets and the standard deduction. We should tax only real capital gains.<br />Prof. S. Abraham Ravid<br />Yeshiva University<br />New York"
