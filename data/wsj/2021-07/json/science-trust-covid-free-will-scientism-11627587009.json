    "body": "Regarding Tunku Varadarajan’s “The Weekend Interview with Matt Ridley: How Science Lost the Public’s Trust” (July 24): Some of the lost trust in science was probably inevitable. Scientists have no particular wisdom as policy makers, and once they take the bait from politicians and media, trust takes a dive. As Americans learn they’ve been naive or duped about matters that affect their lives, science takes the blame.<br />Americans need to take some measure of responsibility. They might be surprised to read the ends of many (perhaps even most) studies, where the authors are tentative about their conclusions and call for more research to replicate or refute what they have found. Maybe after Covid, scientists who are convinced of their own political neutrality will deceive themselves and the rest of us less often.<br />Richard Moldawsky, M.D.<br />Laguna Hills, Calif.<br />"
