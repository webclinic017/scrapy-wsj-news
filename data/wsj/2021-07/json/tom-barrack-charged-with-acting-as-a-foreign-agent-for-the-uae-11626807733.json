    "body": "Tom Barrack, the real-estate investor and a longtime ally of former President Donald Trump, was arrested Tuesday in Los Angeles on charges that he acted as a foreign agent of the United Arab Emirates and lied to federal investigators.<br />A seven-count indictment filed by the U.S. Attorney’s office in Brooklyn, N.Y., alleges that Mr. Barrack, along with a former employee and an Emirati businessman, acted at the direction of senior Emirati officials to influence Mr. Trump’s policy positions and to influence public opinion in favor of U.A.E. interests.<br />Mr. Barrack, 74 years old, faces one count of acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government and one count of conspiracy. He was also charged with obstruction of justice and four counts of making false statements during a June 2019 interview with federal law-enforcement agents. Prosecutors said they would seek his detention at a court proceeding in Los Angeles Tuesday afternoon.<br />Mr. Barrack was a powerful supporter of Mr. Trump’s, serving as an informal adviser on the Middle East to the 2016 campaign and eventually seeking unsuccessfully to become the special envoy to the Middle East, the indictment said. He went on to chair Mr. Trump’s 2017 inaugural committee, which was the subject of two federal investigations into its spending and into possible illegal foreign donations.<br />A spokesperson for Mr. Barrack said: “Mr. Barrack has made himself voluntarily available to investigators from the outset. He is not guilty and will be pleading not guilty.”"
