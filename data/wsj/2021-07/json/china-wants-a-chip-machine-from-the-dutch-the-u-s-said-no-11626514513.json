    "body": "Some of the tech industry’s most important machines are made next to corn fields in the Netherlands. The U.S. government is trying to make sure they don’t end up in China.<br />Beijing has been pressuring the Dutch government to allow its companies to buy  ASML Holding  NV’s marquee product: a machine called an extreme ultraviolet lithography system that is essential to making advanced microprocessors.<br />The one-of-a-kind, 180-ton machines are used by companies including  Intel Corp. , South Korea’s  Samsung Electronics Co.  and leading  Apple Inc.  supplier  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  to make the chips in everything from cutting-edge smartphones and 5G cellular equipment to computers used for artificial intelligence.<br />China wants the $150-million machines for domestic chip makers, so smartphone giant Huawei Technologies Co. and other Chinese tech companies can be less reliant on foreign suppliers. But ASML hasn’t sent a single one because the Netherlands—under pressure from the U.S.—is withholding an export license to China.<br />The Biden administration has asked the government to restrict sales because of national-security concerns, according to U.S. officials. The stance is a holdover from the Trump White House, which first identified the strategic value of the machine and reached out to Dutch officials."
