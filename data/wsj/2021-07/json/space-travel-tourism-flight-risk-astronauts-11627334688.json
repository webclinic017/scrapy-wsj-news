    "body": "Kevin Cook states important truths about risk in pioneering endeavors (“The Case Against Space Tourism,” op-ed, July 23). Undoubtedly we too often ignore these, and we should fight hard against pressure to cut corners for profit or prestige. But I find his argument that only trained professionals should be included on these endeavors shortsighted and more than a little patronizing. Would America even exist if the ships crossing the Atlantic in the 17th century were limited to maritime professionals?<br />Perhaps, as Mr. Cook contends, Christa McAuliffe did not fully understand the risks she was taking on the Challenger mission. If so, shame on everyone. But maybe she did. Certainly she had the intellectual capacity to do so, and her mission was worthwhile: communicating from a nontechnical perspective the wonders of space to a broad audience, and especially to children, where her expertise would have been invaluable.<br />Richard Hazleton<br />Naples, Fla."
