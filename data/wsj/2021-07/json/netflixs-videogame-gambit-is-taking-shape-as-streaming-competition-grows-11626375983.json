    "body": "Netflix Inc.  co-founder Reed Hastings has often said he sees videogames as the streaming company’s biggest competitor for customers.<br />Now, he wants Netflix to make its own videogames, and the company has tapped an industry veteran to oversee its strategy.<br />The move speaks to Netflix’s desire to attract new customers and keep users on its platform for longer periods, and it comes as the company is facing its first serious challenges to its streaming business. New entrants, including  Walt Disney Co. ’s Disney+ and WarnerMedia’s HBO Max, are making inroads, and deep-pocketed rivals such as  Apple Inc.  and  Amazon.com Inc.  are spending aggressively on content as well.<br />Netflix is still the dominant streaming service with more than 200 million subscribers world-wide, but its growth has slowed this year as pandemic-related shutdowns end. Investors have been watching closely to see if Netflix will diversify its revenue sources beyond subscriptions to support its increasing content budget.<br />Videogames could be a lucrative solution. Global consumer spending on game software is projected to reach $175.8 billion this year and exceed $200 billion by 2023, according to Newzoo BV. Mobile games—the kind Netflix is expected to focus on—are on track to make up roughly half of this year’s haul."
