    "body": "James Meketa, founder, managing principal and chairman of Meketa Investment Group, says he sees three “tides of history” that investors should factor into future asset allocations: an aging baby boomer generation, the emergence of China as an economic superpower and the effects of climate change.<br />“The first thing you do is, you step back and identify what type of history you are awash in. And then try to surf along with the tide,” Mr. Meketa told the pension overseers of the Orange County Employees Retirement System at their pension meeting on Wednesday. “It will inform your asset allocation decisions.”<br />Consulting firms such as Meketa Investment Group often have strong influence over how their clients allocate capital, as clients tend to have fewer staffing resources and less specialized investment expertise. Meketa Investment Group serves as the general consultant to the $20.2 billion Orange County pension system, and advises a host of other institutional investors, including California Public Employees’ Retirement System.<br />Mr. Meketa said that 25% of the American population will be over 65 years of age and the last of the baby boomers will retire by 2031. The average net worth of baby boomers is significantly higher than that of their children or grandchildren, he said.<br />“As this plays out, it’s going to absolutely affect politics and insurance,” he said. “We have to think about how it will affect economics, politics and returns.”"
