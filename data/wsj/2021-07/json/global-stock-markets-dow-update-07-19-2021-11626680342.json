    "body": "U.S. stock futures, oil prices and government bond yields slid, amid anxiety that the spread of the Delta coronavirus variant and rising inflation would hold back the global economy.<br />Futures for the S&P 500 fell 0.8%, signaling opening losses for the broad stock-market gauge after it snapped a three-week winning streak Friday. Contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1%. Futures on the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 fell 0.4%.<br />In a sign that investors were sheltering in the safety of government bonds and other safe-haven assets, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell to 1.257% Monday from 1.30% Friday. Yields, which fall when bond prices climb, havenâ€™t been that low since mid-February. The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other currencies, rose 0.3%.<br />Oil prices fell after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a Russia-led group of big producers agreed to raise production. Futures on Brent crude, the international benchmark, fell 2.6% to $71.67 a barrel, their lowest level since mid-June.<br />The moves were reminiscent of trading patterns that prevailed in the early days of the pandemic. Investors sold shares of companies directly affected by restrictions on movement and business, while buying government bonds and stocks that stood to benefit from the work-at-home phenomenon."
