    "body": "Wall Street investment bankers are well-accustomed to jockeying for multimillion-dollar fees on corporate deals. Now, the game is focused on just showing up.<br />After more than a year of Zoom, Wall Street’s elite are beginning to emerge from behind their screens and returning to the timeworn custom of in-person client visits, handshakes and wine-soaked dinners.<br />Rivals Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and  JPMorgan Chase  & Co., which have already brought their employees back to the office faster than the rest of Wall Street, are urging their bankers to get out and visit boldfaced corporate clients —and quickly, before others do.<br />Goldman chief David Solomon began touting the importance of traveling to see clients as soon as New York state quarantine restrictions softened in early April, people close to him say. He modeled the desired behavior himself, asking bankers if they had clients he should visit while he was making trips to places such as Florida and California on his corporate jet. This prompted senior bankers, many of whom had been holed up in the Hamptons and Palm Beach, to hit the pavement.<br />JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon sprung into action and began pushing the firm’s fleet of private jets on managing directors, saying, “If you need to use a plane to go see a client, use it. There are no excuses,” according to a person familiar with the chief executive’s communication."
