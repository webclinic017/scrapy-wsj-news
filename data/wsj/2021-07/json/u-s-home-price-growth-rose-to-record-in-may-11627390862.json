    "body": "Home-price growth climbed to a new record in May, as low mortgage interest rates continued to drive robust homebuying demand.<br />The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, rose 16.6% in the year that ended in May, up from a 14.8% annual rate the prior month. May marked the highest annual rate of price growth since the index began in 1987.<br />Home-price growth has accelerated in the past year as buyers competed fiercely for a limited number of homes on the market. The Covid-19 pandemic spurred households to seek out more living space, and interest rates have held near record lows. Many homes are getting multiple offers and selling above asking price.<br />The median existing-home sales price in June rose 23.4% from a year earlier to $363,300, a record high, the National Association of Realtors said earlier this month.<br />“It’s an incredibly strong housing market,” said Hilla Sferruzza, chief financial officer at home builder Meritage Homes Corp."
