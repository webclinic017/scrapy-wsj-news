    "body": "BEIJING—China’s economic rebound slowed in the second quarter but continued to show unusual resilience more than a year after the country largely got control of the coronavirus within its borders.<br />China’s factories delivered another stronger-than-expected quarter of output while its consumers beat lowered expectations, raising hopes that domestic spending might play a greater role in sustaining momentum in the coming months.<br />All told, China’s government said Thursday that gross domestic product grew by 7.9% in the second quarter from a year earlier, in line with economists’ expectations.<br />While that growth rate was far slower than the 18.3% year-over-year GDP jump during the first three months 2021, nobody expected China’s economy to sustain that pace of growth as the statistical distortions from last year’s pandemic crisis faded.<br />The second-quarter growth figure helped power China’s economy to a 12.7% expansion for the first half of the year compared with the pandemic-scarred first six months of 2020."
