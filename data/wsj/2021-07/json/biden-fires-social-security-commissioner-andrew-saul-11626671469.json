    "body": "Social Security is the third rail of U.S. politics. As George W. Bush wrote, touch it and you are toast. Now you are toast if you manage the program to serve Americans better (“The Meaning of Biden’s Firing Spree,” Review & Outlook, July 13).<br />President Biden fired Social Security Commissioner Andrew Saul because he pushed hard to make systems and operations more efficient. Managing Social Security more effectively upsets the agency’s union leaders.<br />Under the Social Security statute, the commissioner can be removed only for cause. Union disapproval does not meet that test. But Supreme Court rulings that similar removal clauses for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Federal Housing Finance Agency were unconstitutional emboldened the president to give the unions what they wanted.<br />Mr. Biden also thumbed his nose at effective management by appointing an acting commissioner, Kilolo Kijakazi, with limited management experience. She served on the Bipartisan Policy Center’s 19-member Commission on Retirement Security, for which I was a chairman. The politically balanced, distinguished members approved a plan to fix Social Security by increasing benefits for lower-income retirees, slowing down benefit growth for the higher-income, and gradually increasing taxes. The only dissenter was Ms. Kijakazi.<br />James B. Lockhart III"
