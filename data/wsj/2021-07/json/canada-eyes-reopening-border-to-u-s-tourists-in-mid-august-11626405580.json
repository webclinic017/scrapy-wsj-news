    "body": "OTTAWA—Canada could start allowing Americans into the country for recreational or tourist activities starting in mid-August, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s office said late Thursday.<br />The border has been closed to most Americans since March 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic prompted travel restrictions.<br />The reopening date is conditional on Canada’s vaccination rollout maintaining its current accelerated pace and new, confirmed Covid-19 cases remaining at some of the lowest levels in the developed world, according to a statement that summarized a teleconference between Mr. Trudeau and the country’s provincial and territorial leaders.<br />Mr. Trudeau told the premiers that Canadian and U.S. officials are in talks about reopening their 5,500-mile land border to tourists and that Canada could be in a position to start allowing fully vaccinated U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents into Canada as of mid-August for nonessential travel, according to the statement.<br />“Canada would be in a position to welcome fully vaccinated travellers from all countries by early September,” the statement said."
