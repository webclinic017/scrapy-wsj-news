    "body": "Weekslong Iranian protests over water scarcity present an early test for incoming president Ebrahim Raisi, who takes office next week amid mounting challenges including a grinding economic crisis and stalled nuclear negotiations with the West.<br />The protests, which began nearly two weeks ago in the oil-rich southwestern province of Khuzestan, center on accusations that the Iranian government is diverting water to drill for oil, service other provinces and drive the area’s ethnic Arabs off the land. Protesters have shouted “We are thirsty,” while some chanted against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Islamic Republic.<br />Iran on Tuesday said it had arrested a number of people on its western border. It accused the culprits of smuggling rifles, pistols and grenades to be used in urban riots and “terrorist operations,” according to state television.<br />At the same time, Iran’s leaders have struck a more conciliatory tone with those involved in the water protests. Mr. Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani have both recognized Khuzestan’s water-shortage problem, and said Iranians have a legal right to protest.<br />“It is really painful for us to see that despite the loyal people living in that province, and with all the abundant natural resources in that area, and with all the factories working there, the people have reached a point where they are dissatisfied with the shortage of water and sewage system,” Mr. Khamenei said in a speech Friday."
