    "body": "One of the stranger aspects of Gen. Mark Milley’s outburst is his apparent assumption that Nazis set the Reichstag Fire (“Gen. Milley Reminisces About the Battle of the Beltway” by Gerard Baker, Free Expression, July 20). The consensus of historians is that a lone Dutch Communist, Marinus van der Lubbe, was responsible. But what the Nazis did next was worse. They claimed that the fire had been a vast plot to topple the state, and used the lie to crush their political opponents. This makes the fire precisely the wrong precedent to cite for those who have spent months screaming that the Jan. 6 riot was an “insurrection.”<br />Adj. Em. Prof. Stephen M.
