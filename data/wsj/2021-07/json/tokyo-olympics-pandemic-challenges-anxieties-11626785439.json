    "body": "“Why?”<br />That’s the question distressing these Summer Olympics, set to kick off Friday in a host nation amid a fresh pandemic state of emergency—and understandably anxious about the arrival of thousands of athletes, support staff, media and guests.<br />The “why” is primarily money, of course. Sure: one can make a stirring case for athletic virtuosity, the aging Olympic spirit and the need for distractions in fragile times. We can put faith into the effectiveness of vaccines and the improvements to virus containment strategies and treatments.<br />But that Olympic flame will be lit in a barren Tokyo stadium on July 23 for the same reason they did a basketball playoff in a bubble and a World Series after a 60-game season: because the powers that be felt it would be too costly to cancel.<br />Most people in Japan aren’t onboard. A new poll by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper found that 55% of respondents don’t want the Games to begin Friday, an uptick from the spring, when doctors admonished organizers to cancel the event, and national disapproval hovered above 70%. In addition, 68% remained skeptical that Olympic protocols would be effective in preventing an uptick in cases in a country where vaccinations, while steadily rising, were slow to roll out."
