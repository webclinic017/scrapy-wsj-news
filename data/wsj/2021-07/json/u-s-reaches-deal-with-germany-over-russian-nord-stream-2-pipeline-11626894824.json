    "body": "The U.S. and Germany detailed an agreement allowing the completion of a controversial Russian natural-gas pipeline, the State Department said Wednesday, giving Germany a long-sought victory on energy supplies while limiting concessions to the U.S. and Ukraine.<br />The deal gives Germany long-sought access to expanded energy supplies and allows Russia to double its deliveries of natural gas directly to Germany, bypassing an existing route through Ukraine, which has opposed the pipeline.<br />The benefits of the deal to the U.S. and Ukraine are less tangible, with U.S. and German officials agreeing to assist Kyiv in energy-related projects and diplomatic initiatives. A U.S. request for a so-called kill-switch clause, enabling Berlin to suspend gas flows in the event of Russian aggression toward its neighbors or Western allies, wasnâ€™t included, officials said.<br />U.S. officials under two previous presidential administrations opposed Nord Stream 2, seeing it as a way for Moscow to heighten its economic and political sway across Europe and trying to stop the project through international pressure and sanctions.<br />President Biden, seeking closer ties with Europe and with Berlin in particular, took a different approach. While still opposing the pipeline, his administration said it was too far along to prevent its completion."
