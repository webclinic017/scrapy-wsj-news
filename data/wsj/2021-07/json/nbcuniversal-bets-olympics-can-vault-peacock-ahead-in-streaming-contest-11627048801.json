    "body": "Kevin Hart and Snoop Dogg aren’t known as sports commentators. But users of the Peacock streaming service will soon be able to get the duo’s takes on Olympic pole vaulting, volleyball or—a new addition—speed climbing.<br />The wrap show from the comedic actor and hip-hop artist is part of a slate of content that  Comcast Corp.’s  NBCUniversal is putting on Peacock for the Olympics as it looks to use the Tokyo Games to jump-start the platform’s growth.<br />NBCUniversal, which has aired the Olympics for decades, will show this summer’s Tokyo Games on its broadcast and cable networks, beginning with the opening ceremony this morning. At least some direct coverage of all 41 competitions except men’s basketball—available to paying Peacock subscribers—will also be aired on the platform’s free, ad-supported tier, which offers a slimmer library of content to its members indefinitely.<br />NBCUniversal hopes its original programs on Peacock, like the talk show, will add further appeal to draw viewers.<br />Rather than serve as traditional sportscasters, Mr. Hart said in an interview that he and his co-host aim to cover the Olympics “in ways nobody else can”—tapping their knowledge of certain sports and getting acquainted with others right alongside viewers."
