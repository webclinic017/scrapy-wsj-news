    "body": "Airlines are trying to put the Covid-19 pandemic behind them. For Delta Air Lines Inc., by virtue of its name, it may be a bit harder.<br />Airlines are coming off what executives have said was the most difficult year in their history. The coronavirus decimated travel demand: People canceled trips in droves and planes took off nearly empty for months. Major airlines lost some $35 billion last year.<br />All airlines faced those troubles. Only Delta is in the unfortunate position of sharing its moniker with a highly transmissible variant of the virus that has been linked to a new surge of infections world-wide.<br />“We just call it the variant,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in an interview.<br />The so-called Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2 variant, is more infectious and appears to be somewhat more effective at evading vaccines than other variants that have emerged so far, though preliminary research suggests full vaccination protects well against severe infections. It is the most worrying of the B.1.617 lineage, first identified in October in India, and has become the dominant strain in the U.S."
