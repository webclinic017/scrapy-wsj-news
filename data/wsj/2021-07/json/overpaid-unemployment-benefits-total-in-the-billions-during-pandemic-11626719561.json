    "body": "States overpaid billions in unemployment assistance after enhanced and extended benefits were approved last year, according to a federal watchdog.<br />A Government Accountability Office report issued Monday said the Labor Department found $12.9 billion in overpayments made in several unemployment programs from April 2020 through March 2021, including some benefit payments that were a result of fraud.<br />In March 2020, Washington lawmakers approved an expansion of the unemployment-benefits system in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and the related economic downturn. Two programs were created: one that offered unemployment assistance to gig workers, the self-employed and others not previously eligible for benefits, and another that extended payments after state benefits were exhausted, which typically occurs in six months or less.<br />Lawmakers also provided a federally funded enhancement on top of amounts approved by states. Initially the enhancement was $600 a week. Since late December 2020, it has been $300 a week.<br />The amount of overpayments represents about 2% of the roughly $660 billion in unemployment benefits paid out by the Treasury Department during the year ended March 31, 2021, though right- and left-leaning analysts at think tanks agree with the GAO that the overpayment rate is likely understated. The Treasury figures donâ€™t include unemployment benefits paid by states, but do include all the enhanced and extended benefits, which were federally funded."
