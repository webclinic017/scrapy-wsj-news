    "body": "Phil Gramm and Mike Solon do their typical fine job explaining regulatory pitfalls in “Biden Turns Back the Progressive Clock” (op-ed, July 15). As they point out, “When interstate trucking became an effective competitor of the railroads, the ICC muted that competition by regulating the new industry.”<br />Given that ubiquitous bumper sticker—“If you got it, a truck brought it”—the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, which required new truckers to seek a “certificate of public convenience and necessity,” could not have been more consequential. Milton and Rose Friedman presented the shocking numbers in “Free To Choose”: Out of some 89,000 applications for certificates, the Interstate Commerce Commission approved about 27,000. That number fell to 25,000 by 1939 and 14,648 by 1974. Meanwhile, tons shipped by regulated trucks in intercity service increased from 25.5 million in 1938 to 698.1 million in 1972, a 27-fold increase. The aggregate value of ICC certificates in 1972 was around $16 billion (in 2021 dollars), but certificate holders weren’t even required to own a single truck.<br />How many tens of thousands of budding entrepreneurs were left by the side of the road until regulatory relief came in 1980? How much greater delivery efficiency might we have enjoyed over those 45 years from 1935 to 1980?<br />William Urban<br />Lititz, Pa."
