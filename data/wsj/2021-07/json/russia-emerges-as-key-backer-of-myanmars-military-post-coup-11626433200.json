    "body": "Russia is emerging as a key backer of Myanmar’s military regime, providing diplomatic support and discussing arms deals since the February coup that toppled the country’s democratically elected government.<br />Moscow hosted Myanmar’s coup leader for discussions about defense relations last month and sent a senior defense official to the Southeast Asian nation, one of the highest-ranking foreigners to visit since the coup.<br />Russia’s position stands in contrast with China, Myanmar’s neighbor, biggest investor and long-term backer, which has kept its distance and expressed concern about stability since the February coup.<br />The Russia connection is giving Myanmar’s generals options, lending the junta recognition and counterbalancing its reliance on Beijing for weapons and other support while the U.S. and other Western nations try to isolate the military-led government, according to foreign-policy specialists. Meanwhile, they said, Russia is seizing an opportunity to expand its influence and prop up a friendly regime, while thwarting Western democratic designs.<br />The Russian government and the Myanmar military’s information office didn’t respond to requests for comment."
