    "body": "The U.S. president has a responsibility to inspire and lead all Americans, and to set the example on the world stage. To comprehend that responsibility fully, he (or she) should personally view Earth from the highest possible vantage point—outer space.<br />When we think of journeying to space, the famous pilgrimages of Yuri Gagarin and Neil Armstrong often come to mind. Yet suborbital space is becoming increasingly accessible to nonastronauts. The recent flights by Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos on rockets their companies built demonstrated this dramatically.<br />The promise of private space enterprise should be harnessed by American leaders to gain an advantage in the space race with China. China has been active by landing a rover on Mars and achieving the first landing on the far side of the moon.<br />If the U.S. hopes to win this space race, public support will be crucial. Yet a recent Morning Consult poll shows Americans rank space 25th in a list of 26 priorities for the Biden administration. Americans aren’t inspired by space in the way they were in the 1950s and ’60s, when space travel thoroughly captured the American consciousness.<br />To rekindle the spirit of American adventure, a U.S. president should travel to space by the end of the decade. This will show that space is a priority for American leadership, and it will signal that the best has yet to come."
