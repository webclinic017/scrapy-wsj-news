    "body": "An eye for an eye is kid stuff compared to the equivalency set forth near the beginning of “The Green Knight,” David Lowery’s mysterious, fantastical and astonishingly beautiful retelling of the 14th-century epic poem “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.” The knight in question is a towering creature with a tree-like head and face that might remind sci-fi fans of Groot from “Guardians of the Galaxy.” He appears at the gates of Camelot at Christmastime, rides his horse right up to King Arthur’s Round Table and asks if anyone present will engage him in combat, the proviso being that whatever injury he may sustain will be returned in kind at his far-off Green Chapel on the following Christmas Day. The challenge is accepted by Gawain (Dev Patel), who lops off the knight’s head with a single stroke of his sword, then embarks on a yearlong journey of honor that seems destined to end with his own beheading.<br />Why does Gawain volunteer? It’s tempting to say that he’s headstrong because he is—a young man, not yet a knight, who is a spoiled, lusty and blithely charming nephew of the king. Gawain wants to prove that he’s made of sterner stuff and aspires to goodness if not greatness, a concept he finds intimidating. Put more simply, he feels the need to discover himself.<br />Simplicity was the magical ingredient in Mr. Lowery’s 2017 feature “A Ghost Story,” a poetic, unexpectedly affecting meditation on loss and yearning in which the ghost is nothing more than a Halloweenish presence, an indeterminate form beneath a white sheet with empty eyeholes. “The Green Knight” is many things—hypnotic, cryptic, dramatic, occasionally funny, certainly poetic and often magical in its way—but simple isn’t one of them. I was puzzled by several of the apparitions Gawain encounters along his route. I wasn’t certain about the function of a white-haired woman who turns up in a blindfold from time to time, or the purpose of a rather pushy talking fox, or why Alicia Vikander plays dual roles, though she’s wonderfully warm and strong in both of them—stronger and smarter than Gawain, who has lots of growing to do. I even had trouble reading some of the stylized and possibly whimsical Gothic script that’s used to announce the story’s successive sections.<br />What’s clear, however, is that Gawain does grow, in spirit as well as physical prowess, and that Mr. Patel makes him alluring and endearing, never mind broodingly handsome. A subtly modern figure at the center of a medieval Christian allegory, Gawain is a hero who has no use for heroics and arrives at courage by way of circuitous self-doubt. And by way of darkly sumptuous settings and sweepingly expansive landscapes. “The Green Knight” doesn’t aspire to the bedazzlements of John Boorman’s 1981 Arthurian classic “Excalibur,” but the production, designed by Jade Healy, and the cinematography, by Andrew Droz Palermo, bespeak the solitude of the period.<br />That’s not to say the spectacle isn’t fascinating, even delightful now and then. In the very first scene the camera studies a barnyard where nothing special is going on, apart from a goose giving a goat a hard time. But there’s a slow-burning development in the background, a few small fingers of fire that emerge from an upstairs window of a nearby house, then turn into a conflagration that consumes the thatched roof. What’s that all about? A reminder, perhaps, of the dangers of the age, the random, ravaging events that test everyone’s faith."
