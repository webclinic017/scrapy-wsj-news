    "body": "Carolina Beach, N.C., faces a perennial problem—replacing the tons of sand regularly washed away so tourists visiting the barrier island have a spot to plunk down their blankets and umbrellas.<br />Mayor LeAnn Pierce says she was elated when the Trump administration made a policy change that allowed coastal communities to use federal anti-erosion funds to replenish their shores with sand from nearby protected areas where birds tend to outnumber beachgoers.<br />“If there isn’t a beach strand for them to visit, they may choose to take their families to other locations on vacation,” said Ms. Pierce, who has run a 62-room hotel for nearly three decades.<br />The funding option for the beach towns may not be around much longer, however. Environmentalists and budget hawks are pressing the Biden administration to reverse the Trump policy on grounds that it threatens wildlife habitat and wastes taxpayer money. In a June 22 court filing, the Interior Department said it planned to make a decision on the policy by Friday.<br />Banning the use of federal funds could force Carolina Beach to dredge sand from offshore or seek special permission from the Interior Department to use protected sand from a nearby inlet, as it did before the policy change, Ms. Pierce said."
