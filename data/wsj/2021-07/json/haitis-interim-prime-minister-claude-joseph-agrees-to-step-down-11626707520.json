    "body": "Haiti’s interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph has agreed to step down and hand power to a political challenger in a bid to stabilize the embattled Caribbean nation following the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse.<br />The country’s elections minister, Mathias Pierre, said on Monday that Mr. Joseph’s resignation forms part of a broad political agreement encouraged by the U.S. and other powers aimed at bringing stability and presidential elections in about four months.<br />Mr. Joseph will yield power to Ariel Henry, a neurosurgeon who was appointed Haiti’s prime minister a little more than a day before Mr. Moïse’s killing. As part of the agreement, Mr. Joseph will become foreign minister in Mr. Henry’s cabinet. Other appointments are still under negotiation.<br />In an audio recording sent to reporters late Sunday, Mr. Henry said he would seek to collaborate with political factions to unify the country.<br />“As prime minister, I make a solemn appeal to national unity…to protect our country from the multiple dangers that trouble us,” he said. “It is going to be through dialogue and collaboration that we will shape together the policies to implement in this interim period.”"
