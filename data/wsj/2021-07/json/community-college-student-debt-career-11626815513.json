    "body": "“Community College Is the Smart Choice,” especially for young people unsure of what they really want after high school (Aaron Rasmussen, op-ed, July 16). After graduating from UCLA, I found myself newly divorced, broke and debt-burdened. Going back to my local community college didn’t feel like a letdown but rather a relief. It gave me hope. I was able to get my RN certificate and take my nursing-boards exam and was offered a job before I finished the program.<br />For 35 years it has afforded me a challenging but rewarding career I could be proud of, a salary that enabled me to pay off my student loans from UCLA, and a lifestyle that has made it all worthwhile. People think community colleges mean one couldn’t afford a more expensive, better education. I see them as stepping stones to a realistic future.<br />Cynthia Kokawa Lerner<br />Los Angeles<br />"
