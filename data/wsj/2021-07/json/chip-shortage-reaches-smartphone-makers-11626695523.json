    "body": "SEOUL—The smartphone industry is showing battle scars from the world-wide chip crunch.<br />Shipments are slowing and customers are seeing their first significant price increases in years. Some companies have had to scale back production and delay new releases. All this has halted what had been a strong start to the year.<br />Smartphone makers, for much of the year, avoided the parts disruptions faced in the auto, personal computer and home-appliance industries. Phone manufacturers purchase key parts roughly a half a year in advance, but now those stockpiles have shrunk.<br />For  Samsung Electronics Co. , the world’s largest smartphone maker, problems sourcing key parts contributed to an expected 20% drop in shipments from the previous quarter.  Alphabet Inc.’s  Google said its Pixel 5a 5G device would be available only in the U.S. and Japan, after the prior year’s models were released more widely.<br />In March, China’s  Xiaomi Corp.  unveiled its latest flagship device in India called the Redmi Note 10, at a price of roughly $161. But as of this month, the phone retails at $174, about 8% higher than the original price. Xiaomi also launched the Mi 11 Ultra in India in April, but sales were delayed and it was only earlier this month that the phone became available for purchase."
