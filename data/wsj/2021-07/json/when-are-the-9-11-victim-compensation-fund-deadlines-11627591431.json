    "body": "As the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks approaches, so does an important deadline for a subset of individuals to register for the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund to potentially receive future benefits related to their illness.<br />The VCF was established to provide federal support to cover medical claims by those who became sick after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Eligibility includes individuals, or those representing a deceased individual, who were present at the World Trade Center and surrounding areas; the crash site at the Pentagon; and the United Flight 93 crash site near Shanksville, Pa., between Sept. 11, 2001, and May 30, 2002.<br />It is estimated that around 400,000 people were exposed to caustic dust and toxic pollutants in the 9/11 dust and debris cloud, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Individuals must have been diagnosed with an illness related to the attacks.<br />There are two main deadlines involving filing a claim for the fund: a registration deadline and a claim filing deadline. “Registration is the first step in the claim filing process and it simply preserves your right to file a claim in the future,” according to the VCF website.<br />Registration deadlines vary based on individual circumstances, according to the VCF."
