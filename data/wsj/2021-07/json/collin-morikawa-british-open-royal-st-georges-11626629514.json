    "body": "Collin Morikawa arrived in Sandwich, England having never played in a British Open. The lumpy, bumpy terrain he found at Royal St. Georges typfies how this event can torture even those golfers who have played these types of courses for decades.<br />But it hasn’t taken the 24-year-old American long to achieve feats that elite golfers spend a lifetime chasing. He established himself as one of golf’s rising talents in 2020. He established himself as one of the game’s preeminent stars this weekend.<br />Morikawa is the 2021 British Open champion.<br />Morikawa came from one stroke behind 54-hole leader Louis Oosthuizen on Sunday to win at 15-under-par with a run of near flawless golf. Three straight birdies on the front nine catapulted him into the lead. But even more spectacularly, he finished with 31 holes without a bogey dating back to Saturday.<br />That allowed him to survive a charge from another American, Jordan Spieth, who produced a string of birdies that kept the pressure on. But when Morikawa walked down the 18th fairway, loudly cheered on by the crowded galleries, his two-stroke lead was secure. Then he tapped in his final par putt, pumped his fist and waved to the crowd—the victory was his."
