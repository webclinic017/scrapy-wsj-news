    "body": "U.S. stock futures slid Monday, suggesting that the major stock indexes will retreat from last week’s all-time highs after markets in China and Hong Kong plummeted.<br />Futures linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.4%. The blue chip index on Friday crossed the 35000 closing milestone for the first time in its history after climbing over 1% last week.<br />Contracts tied to the broader S&P 500 benchmark ticked 0.3% lower Monday. Futures for the Nasdaq-100 edged down 0.1%, suggesting that large technology stocks may grind lower at the opening bell.<br />The mood in global markets soured after Beijing took aim at some of the country’s fast-growing listed companies over the weekend, prompting a sharp selloff and fueling concerns about regulatory risks in a key overseas market. The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 2.3% by the close of trading, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index shed 4.1% in its biggest one-day rout in over a year.<br />“More regulatory tightening from China is having an impact on sentiment,” said Hugh Gimber, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Worries about rising Covid-19 cases and whether that may lead to fresh lockdowns and more supply-chain bottlenecks is also triggering some pessimism in markets, he said."
