    "body": "It feels like everyone’s doing it.<br />More than 7.5 million workers quit their jobs in April and May, up from 4.3 million during the same period the year before. Everyone’s talking about fresh starts. Burnout, the return-to-office mandate, boredom after a year of career stagnation: They can all seem like good enough reasons to send that farewell email.<br />But is leaving your job right now the right call? How do you make a decision you won’t regret?<br />More than a third of workers are looking for a new job, according to a May survey of 1,021 Americans from PricewaterhouseCoopers.
