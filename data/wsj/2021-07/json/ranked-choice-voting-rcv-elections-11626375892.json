    "body": "Harvey Mansfield’s op-ed “Ranked-Choice Is Bad for Everyone” (July 8) is spot on. I’ve seen how flawed ranked-choice voting can be. Voters in Portland, Maine, went to the polls June 8 to elect a commission to rewrite the city’s charter. The Democratic Socialists gamed the system perfectly. Their candidates ran as a group, the Rose Slate, and encouraged voters who supported any of their four candidates to list the other three as their second, third and fourth choices. In a crowded field, they swept all four at-large seats.<br />Here’s the kicker: One of the moderate candidates received 21.1% of the first-choice vote, the second-highest total, but failed to get elected. At the same time, a member of the Rose Slate got 4.2% and was elected. How can this be considered a more accurate representation of voters’ will?<br />Samuel H. Rosenthal<br />Portland, Maine<br />"
