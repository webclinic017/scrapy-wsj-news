    "body": "TOKYO—It was a bad sign for Team USA men’s basketball when Nigeria and Australia beat them in exhibitions. But those were exhibitions. The U.S. builds its roster from NBA All-Stars teams and Olympic golds are expected to be cakewalks no matter how many red flags are spotted.<br />Then the Americans stepped on the floor in Tokyo and everything that had been a potential concern turned into the reality of an opening loss at the Olympics.<br />Team USA suffered an ugly 83-76 defeat to France, a country that produces more varieties of cheese than NBA players, leaving the favorites to win gold racing to figure out if it can solve its problems before it’s too late.<br />The good news for the Americans is that they’re still extremely likely to get out of their group with Iran and Czech Republic and into the knockout round. But it’s bad news when that’s good news.<br />The Americans entered the fourth quarter trailing 62-56 but a sustained hot stretch during a lengthy French drought delivered the U.S. a seven-point lead with 3:41 left. That’s when just about everything that could go wrong did go wrong. The Americans went 3:31 without scoring until Damian Lillard hit a couple of meaningless free throws with 10 seconds left. There were turnovers, bricks and the strange sights of Frenchmen simply playing better basketball."
