    "body": "WASHINGTON—Jeff Ricchetti’s lobbying firm has flourished in the months since his brother Steve Ricchetti was named a senior counselor to President Biden, according to reports released Tuesday.<br />His firm, Ricchetti Inc., collected $1.67 million in lobbying fees in the first half of the year, new lobbying records show—more than quadruple the $370,000 it reported in the same period of last year. Jeff Ricchetti is the only registered lobbyist at his firm.<br />After years of stagnation, Mr. Ricchetti’s client list began to grow rapidly as Mr. Biden won the Democratic nomination and defeated former President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election, records show. Mr. Ricchetti has since picked up high-profile clients such as  Amazon.com Inc.,  General Motors Co. and  TC Energy Corp. , the company behind the Keystone Pipeline.<br />Lobbying disclosure records from the first three months of the year showed that in addition to contacting Congress, Jeff Ricchetti also was in touch with the Executive Office of the President, which includes West Wing staff, on behalf of several of his clients.<br />Records show Jeff Ricchetti had not lobbied the EOP during the Trump administration or most of the Obama administration."
