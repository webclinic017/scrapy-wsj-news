    "body": "TOKYO—Tokyo on Tuesday set a daily record for Covid-19 cases, reporting 2,848 new infections on the fifth day of the Summer Olympics in the Japanese capital.<br />The record is unlikely to be related to the arrival of some 50,000 athletes and others for the Olympics, since many landed in Tokyo just last week and the visitors have been largely separated from the general population.<br />Nonetheless, it highlights the reason many people in Japan felt uneasy about hosting the Games, which were delayed by a year by the virus. All Olympics events in Tokyo are being held without spectators.<br />The number of new cases Tuesday surpassed the previous daily record of 2,520 set on Jan. 7. The latest tally included cases recorded early this week after a four-day holiday weekend tied to Friday’s Olympic opening ceremony in Tokyo.<br />As in other countries, the Delta variant of the Covid-19 virus has been driving an increase in cases in Japan, although the number is smaller than other countries experiencing Delta-related surges."
