    "body": "WASHINGTON—The decision by insurance brokers  Aon  PLC and  Willis Towers Watson  PLC to scuttle their $30 billion merger underscores the hard line the Biden administration is forming on antitrust and competition issues.<br />The two companies abandoned their deal Monday, citing the futility of going forward after the Justice Department filed suit to block it last month.<br />Former Federal Trade Commission Chairman William Kovacic, a Republican, said the Justice Department challenge was “a first important step by the new administration to contest deals more aggressively.”<br />“The prosecution of the case and the capitulation by the parties likely will cause other deal makers to reassess the regulatory risks of new transactions,” Mr. Kovacic said.<br />While the investigation that led to the suit began under the Trump administration, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has made the case a priority since taking office this year."
