    "body": "In the weeks before this NBA season began, the Milwaukee Bucks made an odd decision.<br />They realized that convincing Giannis Antetokounmpo to sign the richest contract in league history and winning their first championship in a half-century both depended on someone who played for another team. They paid a fortune to trade for him. They paid another fortune to extend his contract. They were gambling the prime of a transcendent player and the future of the entire team on Jrue Holiday.<br />It took three plays in three seconds on Saturday for their bet on a borderline star to pay off.<br />One steal. One pass. One tip. The ball was barely in his hands, but Holiday’s fingerprints were all over their Game 5 win.<br />It was exactly what the Bucks had in mind when they brought him to Milwaukee, even if they couldn’t have dreamed that it would give them a 3-2 lead in the NBA Finals and a shot to win the title at home on Tuesday."
