    "body": "Earlier this month, English sports fans briefly allowed themselves to believe in sporting success. The national soccer team was in the final of the European Championship. The Three Lions were playing on home soil. Football was coming home.<br />Then, abruptly, it wasn’t. A devastating loss in a penalty shootout reminded sports fans just what it means to be English: long waits for success interspersed with soul-crushing defeats.<br />As it turns out, one miniscule group of people who don’t play soccer understood precisely how much it hurts to go decades without a trophy in a sport the country obsesses over. They’re known as English professional golfers.<br />And days after the soccer team’s failure against Italy, they have a chance to lift the national morale—at least a little. What if an Englishman actually won a British Open in England?<br />Even if it’s not coming home, it can still come home to Sandwich."
