    "body": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi named Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois and critic of former President Donald Trump, to serve on a select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.<br />He joins Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming as the only Republicans on the committee.<br />Mrs. Pelosi last Wednesday rejected two other Republicans close to Mr. Trump: Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, chair of the conservative Republican Study Committee, and Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee. The move prompted Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to pull his other three selections for the committee.<br />House GOP leadership has opposed the formation of the committee, calling it a political exercise and pointing to continuing law-enforcement probes as adequate.<br />“The Speaker has structured this select committee to satisfy her political objectives,” said Mr. McCarthy in a statement following Mr. Kinzinger’s appointment. “She had months to work with Republicans on a reasonable and fair approach to get answers on the events and security failures surrounding January 6. Instead, she has played politics.”"
