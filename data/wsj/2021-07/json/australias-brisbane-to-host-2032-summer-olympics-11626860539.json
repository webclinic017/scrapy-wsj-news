    "body": "TOKYO—The International Olympic Committee on Wednesday awarded the 2032 Summer Games to Brisbane, Australia, after designating the city earlier this year as the sole contender.<br />Brisbane will become the third Australian city to host the Games after Melbourne in 1956 and Sydney in 2000.<br />“Brisbane 2032 is the first future host to have been elected under, and to have fully benefited from, the new flexible approach to electing Olympic hosts,” said IOC President Thomas Bach, referring to a process under which the IOC designated Brisbane as its preferred host.<br />Previous Olympics have been criticized for leaving host cities with large debts and underused facilities. Mr. Bach said the IOC wanted to “encourage Olympic projects which use a high percentage of existing and temporary venues.”<br />The Brisbane Games are tentatively set for July 23 to Aug. 8, 2032, the same dates on the calendar as this year’s Tokyo Olympics, which begin Friday."
