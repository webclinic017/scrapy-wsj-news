    "body": "Regarding “Why the Lawyers Cartel Is Pushing for Woke Law Schools” (op-ed, July 16): What John O. McGinnis describes as proposals of the American Bar Association are in fact proposals of the Council of the ABA Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar. As the national accreditor of law schools, the council serves as an independent arm of the ABA, as required by the U.S. Education Department. Final decisions on accreditation rest with the council.<br />The council released the proposals Mr. McGinnis refers to for public comment, consistent with council procedures, and received more than three dozen comments. If the council follows past practices, a revised proposal will again be submitted for comment, and no final proposal would be readied until next year at the earliest.<br />The ABA is steadfastly committed to eliminating bias and enhancing inclusion in the legal profession and the justice system. The current legal education standards reflect those objectives. I am confident the council, as it reviews revisions to its diversity and inclusion standards, will weigh all views and make decisions that are in the best interests of legal education and its many stakeholders.<br />Patricia Lee Refo<br />President, American Bar Association"
