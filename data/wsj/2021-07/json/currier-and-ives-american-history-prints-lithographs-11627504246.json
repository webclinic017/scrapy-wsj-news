    "body": "<br /><br /><br />Shelburne, Vt.<br />The creation of a national memory is a long, halting process, a kind of self-guided evolution conducted by citizens, politicians and scholars. It involves selecting aspects of earlier eras that have continuing resonance, demonstrating how ideas or values led to successes or failures, and sifting through accumulated understandings as they are transformed by the onrush of history. It is a form of cultivation that continues over generations: pruning and rejecting, conserving and reshaping."
