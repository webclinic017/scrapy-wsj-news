    "body": "On Nov. 19, 2018, Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn was taken into custody as he passed through Tokyo’s Haneda airport. He was eventually charged with underreporting his income and using millions in Nissan funds to cover personal investment losses, and if convicted he faced up to 15 years in prison. But after spending 130 days in custody, and posting $13.7 million in bail, he fled Japan for Lebanon, hiding in an audio equipment case as it was rolled onto a private jet. He now lives in Beirut, out of reach of Japanese prosecutors.<br />It’s an astonishing story, but only a small part of the one that Hans Greimel, a veteran car industry reporter, and William Sposato, a journalist based for many years in Japan, choose to tell in “Collision Course: Carlos Ghosn and the Culture Wars That Upended an Auto Empire.” Messrs. Greimel and Sposato’s book is less a tale of Mr. Ghosn’s rise and fall than an examination of the differences in corporate, legal and political cultures between Japan and the West. How is it that such advanced economies and societies can so often misunderstand each other? And was Mr. Ghosn simply a victim of this historic pattern?<br />Mr. Ghosn was born in Brazil to a family with Lebanese roots. As a child he moved to Lebanon and then France, where he stayed, earning a pair of engineering degrees and rising through the ranks at Michelin and later Renault. A citizen of France, Brazil and Lebanon, he is fluent in English, French, Portuguese and Arabic. In 1999, when Renault invested in Nissan, Mr. Ghosn was tapped as chief operating officer of the Japanese automaker.<br />At Renault, headquartered near Paris, Mr. Ghosn was known as “Le Cost Killer,” and in his new role he more than lived up to his reputation. He cut jobs, closed plants, paid down debt and renegotiated with suppliers, paying no regard to Japan’s cozy corporate networks and traditions. Within three years Mr. Ghosn had risen to become chief executive, and Nissan was back in the black. He lived the part of the globe-trotting corporate titan, jetting frequently between Tokyo and Paris and elsewhere, preaching the importance of scale in the car industry. In the meantime, he and his wife raised four children, before they divorced in 2012. When Mr. Ghosn married a second time in 2016, he celebrated with a party at the Palace of Versailles that would come to symbolize his growing hubris.<br />While other international car partnerships failed, including Daimler-Chrysler and Volkswagen-Suzuki, Mr. Ghosn made Renault-Nissan work. He capped his career in 2016 with the purchase of a controlling stake in Mitsubishi, creating the largest auto group in the world. One of Mr. Ghosn’s former advisers told the authors of “Collision Course” that what his boss was trying to do “was unprecedented in the history of the auto industry, which was combine strong companies that are truly nationally significant and keep them together,” not just for one economic cycle but in a way that “was really permanent.” Given the economic and symbolic importance of the car industry, he was also frequently having to manage the attentions of meddlesome politicians."
