    "body": "Growing up in Guilford, Conn., Gabriella Lanouette watched her mother head off to work each day as a pediatric nurse.<br />“Every day she comes home having helped kids,” says Ms. Lanouette, who began planning her own career in healthcare while still a child. “Seeing her work in this field was really inspiring to me.”<br />As she got older she realized she didn’t want to be a healthcare provider, so she began looking for other ways to get involved in the field. A passion for coding led to an engineering job. After earning a master’s degree from Columbia University, Ms. Lanouette landed a job at Orbis International, an international nonprofit focused on preventing and treating blindness and eye diseases in economically developing countries.<br />Ms. Lanouette is part of a team that develops algorithms for the company’s telemedicine platform, Cybersight. Clinicians use the tool to diagnose eye diseases like diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma, uploading images of the back of the eye to the platform, which provides artificial intelligence-enabled analysis.<br />The Wall Street Journal recently spoke with Ms. Lanouette about how her pursuit of a career in healthcare led her to engineering. Here’s her story, edited and condensed."
