    "body": "SINGAPORE—China confirmed it would take drastic steps to restrain the country’s booming after-school tutoring industry, prompting further selloffs in stocks like  New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc.  on Monday.<br />The restrictions, published over the weekend by state media, are the most recent regulatory assault on a fast-growing part of the Chinese economy. They follow a monthslong crackdown on various parts of China’s technology industry that has rattled companies like  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , its unlisted sister company Ant Group Co., and ride-hailing giant  Didi Global Inc.<br />Investors have grown more worried about the tutoring industry’s prospects, as Beijing moves to tackle spiraling educational costs that have helped deter many families from having more children.<br />Education in China is fiercely competitive, with particular focus on the gaokao, China’s version of the SAT for entering college. This has created a thriving industry of cram schools to help students get ahead. According to the Chinese Society of Education, about seven in 10 students in kindergarten through 12th grade receive after-school tutoring in major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.<br />New Oriental’s Hong Kong-listed shares, which lost more than two-fifths of their value on Friday, crashed by an additional 47% on Monday. That gave the company a market value of about $3.5 billion, according to FactSet."
