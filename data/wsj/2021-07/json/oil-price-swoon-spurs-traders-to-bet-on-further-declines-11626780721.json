    "body": "Bets that oil investors made in options markets help explain why crude prices fell so sharply on Monday, and also show that traders are bracing for prices to lurch lower once more.<br />U.S. crude prices swooned in tandem with stocks and other industrial commodities to start the week after the spread of the coronavirus Delta variant shook confidence in the global economic rebound. West Texas Intermediate futures failed to recover on Tuesday, holding prices about 14% below their recent high at $66.41 a barrel.<br />Monday’s decline—oil’s biggest since September—interrupted a relentless climb that had pushed prices to multiyear highs, hiking gasoline bills for drivers and leading Washington to encourage Mideast producers to pump more crude. Some investors were betting that a combination of constrained supplies and booming demand would push oil above $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014.<br />Behind the burst of volatility is a realization that vaccines won’t prevent episodic flare-ups in infection and the introduction of measures to control new variants, according to Marwan Younes, chief investment officer at Massar Capital Management, a commodities-focused hedge fund.<br />“It’s going to be a lot more turbulent than people expected,” he said."
