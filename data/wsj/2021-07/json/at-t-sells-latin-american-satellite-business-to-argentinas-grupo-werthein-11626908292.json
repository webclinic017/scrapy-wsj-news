    "body": "AT&T Inc.  said it agreed to sell its Vrio satellite business in Latin America to Argentina’s Grupo Werthein, continuing the Dallas telecom giant’s move away from the television business.<br />The sale covers 10.3 million subscribers across 11 countries in the Western Hemisphere, including Argentina, Chile and Colombia, inherited from AT&T’s purchase of DirecTV. The wireless carrier said the sale will trigger a $4.6 billion accounting charge, which includes $2.1 billion tied to “accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments.”<br />AT&T is slated to report quarterly earnings on Thursday.<br />An AT&T spokesman said the transaction carries an enterprise value of $500 million, which will be paid over the next few years. The companies expect to close the deal in early 2022.<br />Vrio has struggled with challenges unique to its home turf, including foreign-exchange rate swings and economic downturns in key markets including Brazil, where the unit holds a controlling stake in satellite-TV service Sky Brasil. The company previously wrote down its operations in Venezuela, where diplomatic tensions with the U.S. threatened the business."
