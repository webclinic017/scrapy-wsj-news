    "body": "AUSTIN, Texas—Democrats and Republicans continued their standoff Wednesday over passing a divisive election bill, even as both sides must now reckon with the challenges of sticking out a 30-day special session.<br />On Monday, scores of House Democrats staged a walkout by chartering two airplanes to Washington, D.C. to keep the Republican-controlled Texas House from having the quorum necessary to pass legislation that would tighten election laws in the state. Republicans have said the laws are needed to ensure secure elections, while Democrats say they will make it harder for their constituents, especially minorities, to vote.<br />If the House Democrats return, they could be arrested and forcibly locked in the legislative chamber until business is concluded, a move Republicans voted to authorize Tuesday after 63 of 67 Democrats were absent.<br />To pay for the Democrats’ expenses in Washington, Powered By People, former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke’s elections-advocacy group, had raised over $526,000 from 14,654 donors as of Wednesday morning, representatives said. The Texas House Democratic Caucus, funded by donations and member dues, has already paid approximately $100,000 for the two chartered airplanes to Washington.<br />Democrats showed no signs of caving in to pressure Wednesday."
