    "body": "China’s battery champion is drawing strength from the electric-vehicle boom.<br />Shares of  Contemporary Amperex Technology Co .  have soared 62% this year, as of Thursday. That has given the company, also known as CATL, a market value of roughly $203 billion, making it the third-largest business listed in mainland China.<br />The rally has outpaced rises for rival battery makers  Panasonic Corp .  of Japan, whose share have gained 10.5%, and  LG Chem Ltd .  in South Korea, which logged a slight drop in the same period. CATL has also outperformed EV makers such as  Tesla Inc . ,  NIO Inc .  and  XPeng Inc . , whose shares have struggled after surging last year.<br />The stock has been boosted by recent deals signed with Tesla and others, plus record sales growth at China’s NIO, XPeng and  Li Auto Inc . , said Kelvin Lau, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets. The three Chinese companies all buy lithium-ion batteries from CATL, which is based in the southeastern province of Fujian.<br />In June, CATL extended a deal to supply Tesla’s Shanghai factory with battery packs until 2025. It has also recently secured new customers including Mercedes-Benz, a unit of Germany’s Daimler AG."
