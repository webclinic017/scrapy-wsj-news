    "body": "Flooding moved to southern and eastern parts of Germany and into neighboring Austria on Sunday, as heavy rainfall over Alpine regions swelled rivers and overwhelmed several towns in the valleys.<br />After the deadly floods that hit western Germany and Belgium last week, authorities farther east were building concrete barriers to protect vulnerable communities, evacuated potential hot spots and towed away cars from parking lots to prevent the torrent from smashing them against houses.<br />The newly threatened areas are on both sides of the border between Germany and Austria and farther east in the German state of Saxony.<br />Authorities in Bavaria reported that one person had died in the flood that started there on Saturday evening. The Bavarian town of Berchtesgaden seemed most affected, as well as Neustadt in Saxony.<br />In Austria, Hallein was badly hit, with water masses carrying cars in the townâ€™s medieval center."
