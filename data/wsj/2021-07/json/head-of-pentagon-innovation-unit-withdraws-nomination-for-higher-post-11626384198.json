    "body": "The director of a Pentagon unit that works with technology companies withdrew his nomination to become the Defense Department’s undersecretary for acquisition due to an inspector general’s investigation into his office.<br />Both the Trump and Biden administrations have identified Michael Brown, a former Silicon Valley executive, as a leader in the Pentagon’s drive to streamline the military’s adoption of private-sector innovation and deny China access to U.S. technology.<br />Mr. Brown, who currently heads the Defense Innovation Unit, withdrew from consideration as undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment this week in a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. In the letter, a copy of which was viewed by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Brown said an investigation into the DIU by the Pentagon’s inspector general would delay his nomination for up to a year and so he would step aside.<br />The letter didn’t provide details on the investigation. A spokeswoman for the Pentagon’s inspector general declined to comment on the matter. A Pentagon spokesman declined to provide details on the investigation.<br />Mr. Brown didn’t respond to a request for comment. A DIU spokeswoman said Mr. Brown plans to remain director of the unit, but wouldn’t comment on the investigation."
