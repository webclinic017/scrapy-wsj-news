The revised law expected next month would codify that.<br />Beijing last amended the 2001 law in 2015 to allow for two children but kept provisions for birth-limit-violation penalties including fines known as “social-maintenance fees.”<br />All remaining penalties for violating birth limits should be removed in the revision to provide a legal framework to encourage births, said He Yafu, an independent demographer based in Guangdong."
