    "body": "<br />By the turn of the 20th century, Henry Ossawa Tanner had attained wide recognition as the most successful and talented Black artist of his time. Born in 1859 on the eve of the Civil War, he died in 1937 in the imminent shadow of World War II. Yet he never painted pictures of conflict or warfare.<br />Rather, he would be known for genre subjects of Black life, landscapes and religious themes. The last doubtless drew inspiration from his father’s profession as an influential African Methodist Episcopal bishop in Pennsylvania. Tanner was born in Pittsburgh and moved as a child to Philadelphia.<br />He showed an early interest in art, which led to his enrollment at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts from 1880 to 1882. There he studied with Thomas Eakins, America’s greatest painter of portraits and the human figure. Tanner soon secured work as an illustrator, and exhibited his first paintings at the National Academy in New York.<br />In 1888 he moved to Atlanta to teach at Clark University for a year. With the failure of Reconstruction and the resurgence of racial discrimination, he left for Paris in 1891, where he would work for much of the rest of his life. Tanner entered the Académie Julien and showed his work at the Salon."
