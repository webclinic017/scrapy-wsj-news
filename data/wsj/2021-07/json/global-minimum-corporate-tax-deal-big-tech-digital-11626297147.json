    "body": "In “It’s Still a Bad Global Tax Deal” (July 9), the editorial board sharply criticizes a deal reached by 132 governments to overhaul global tax rules to address challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy. The editorial speaks of a “tech tax,” alluding to the preliminary agreement on the reallocation of certain taxing rights. But there is no mention of a clear benefit and key driver of these negotiations: securing the removal of unilateral tax measures that attempt to ring-fence the digital economy and target U.S. companies.<br />While lawmakers and industry alike will need time to evaluate the agreement, it offers a promising opportunity to stop unilateral digital-services taxes already adopted by France, Turkey and India, and most recently pursued by Canada and the European Union. These measures, which both the Biden and Trump administrations characterized as discriminatory, undermine the international tax system and compromise predictability for companies that conduct business globally.<br />Jason Oxman<br />Information Technology Industry Council<br />Washington"
