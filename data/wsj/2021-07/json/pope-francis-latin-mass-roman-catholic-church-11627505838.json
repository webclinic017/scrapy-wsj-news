    "body": "Regarding Matthew Walther’s “Pope Francis, the Latin Mass and My Family” (Houses of Worship, July 23): I don’t regularly attend a Latin Mass but I do remember it from childhood. Everyone dressed in Sunday best, and a good number excluded themselves from receiving Holy Communion.<br />Nowadays fewer Catholics attend Mass regularly, they tend to come late and leave early, and it is not unusual to see T-shirts, short-shorts and flip-flops. Everyone presents at the altar for Communion. One study found that around 1 in 3 U.S. Catholics believes in the true presence of Jesus in the Eucharist. I’d guess that more than 90% of Latin Mass attendees do.<br />The Pope and the bishops should focus on bringing their lost sheep back into the fold, and worry less about the truly devout who attend Latin Mass.<br />Ray Martin<br />Ridgefield, Conn."
