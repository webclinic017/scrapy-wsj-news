    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is proposing a rule that would accelerate federal procurement policy to require a higher level of American-made products.<br />Under an initiative to be announced Wednesday, the government would require that products obtained under the longstanding “Buy American” program have at least 60% of the value of components made in the U.S., up from the current 55% threshold. That would increase to 75% by 2029, White House officials said.<br />President Biden is expected to discuss the proposal during a visit Wednesday to a Mack Trucks plant in Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state that he narrowly won in 2020 following Donald Trump’s victory there in 2016.<br />The proposal aims to strengthen compliance by requiring contractors to prove that the products they purchase on behalf of the government meet the content threshold. Currently, contractors tell the government if they meet that standard, according to administration officials.<br />“This proposal would close a problematic loophole in the current regulation, while also allowing businesses time to adjust their supply chains to increase the use of American-made components,” according to a White House fact sheet."
