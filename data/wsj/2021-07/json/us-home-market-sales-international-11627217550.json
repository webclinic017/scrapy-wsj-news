    "body": "Foreign purchases of U.S. homes declined for a fourth straight year as the Covid-19 pandemic sharply limited international travel.<br />Foreigners bought $54.4 billion in U.S. residential real estate in the year ended in March, down 27% from the prior year, according to a report released Monday by the National Association of Realtors. That is the lowest level on record since NAR began collecting the data in 2011.<br />Domestic homebuying demand has been so robust that the decline in sales to foreign buyers hasn’t weighed on the overall market, said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist. Existing-home sales rose in 2020 to their highest level since 2006 and are widely expected to rise again this year.<br />“The decline in our international business was offset completely by the unprecedented demand, domestically, that we saw,” said Brent Leathwood, a real-estate broker in Sarasota, Fla.<br />Mr. Yun said he expects foreign purchases to increase next year as international travel rebounds. That could mean even more competition for domestic buyers, who are already vying for a limited number of homes on the market."
