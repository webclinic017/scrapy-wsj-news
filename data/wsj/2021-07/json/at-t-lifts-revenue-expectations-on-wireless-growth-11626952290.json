    "body": "AT&T Inc.â€™s  second-quarter revenue rose 7.6% driven by new subscribers to its cellphone service, leading it to increase its financial outlook for the year.<br />The media and telecommunications giant said it is focusing on continuing to expand its broadband business and cellphone subscriber base, its core profit engine. The company now expects consolidated revenue growth between 2% and 3%, up from a prior view of about 1% growth.<br />AT&T has boosted its wireless subscriber count over the past year by dangling significant smartphone discounts in exchange for long-term commitments, prompting rivals  Verizon Communications Inc.  and  T-Mobile US Inc.  to respond with their own promotions.<br />The discounts, while expensive, helped AT&T post a net gain of 789,000 postpaid phone subscribers during the second quarter. Investors value postpaid plans, which charge customers for service after it is rendered, because account holders tend to provide dependable profits.<br />Verizon on Wednesday said it gained 275,000 postpaid phone customers during the most recent quarter. T-Mobile is slated to report its results next week."
