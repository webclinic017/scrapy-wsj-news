    "body": "Marty Makary argues convincingly that America’s reported youth Covid-19 deaths—400—likely overstates the number who died on account of Covid (“The Flimsy Evidence Behind the CDC’s Push to Vaccinate Children,” op-ed, July 20). Even if it doesn’t, that’s 400 out of around 75 million. More deadly to this cohort are the seasonal flu, fatal car accidents, suicide and drowning.<br />As the Covid risk to youth is minuscule and the adult population approaches herd immunity, what need is there for the government to promote, let alone require, child vaccination? The U.K. has announced it will not administer Covid vaccines to youths under 18, other than those with underlying health conditions.<br />Gordon Gould<br />Boulder, Colo.<br />"
