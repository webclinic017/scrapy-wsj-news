    "body": "Inflation heated up again this week, but it’s nowhere near as hot as funds specializing in bonds that fight it.<br />Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that buy TIPS, or Treasury inflation-protected securities, are boasting yields of 8% or more in a bond market where even 4% looks outlandish. Such funds took in an estimated $36.3 billion in new money in the first half of 2021, according to Morningstar—a record for any six-month period since TIPS funds were born in the late 1990s.<br />If an 8% yield tempts you to join them, listen up. These funds that purport to fight inflation are, ironically, inflating their own reported yields.<br />I’ve written about this problem before, but it’s never been worse. This week, every single inflation-protected security was trading at a negative yield to maturity before inflation. Yet more than two dozen mutual funds and ETFs that own these bonds are reporting yields of 6%, 7%, even 8% or more.<br />How the heck can that be? Are investors expecting double-digit rises in the cost of living? Or are fund companies exploiting a regulatory loophole for marketing purposes?"
