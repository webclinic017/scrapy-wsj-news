    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden on Monday sought to clarify his criticism of  Facebook Inc.,  asserting that the company itself wasn’t killing people by not doing enough to clamp down on misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines.<br />Pointing to research indicating a significant amount of false information comes from 12 social-media users, Mr. Biden told reporters at the White House: “Facebook isn’t killing people. These 12 people are out there giving misinformation. Anyone listening to it is getting hurt by it. It’s killing people. It’s bad information.”<br />Mr. Biden said he hoped his public remarks would prod Facebook to do more. “My hope is that Facebook, instead of taking it personally—that somehow I’m saying Facebook is killing people—that they would do something about the misinformation, the outrageous information about the vaccine,” he said. “That’s what I meant.”<br />The president said he hadn’t seen any indication that Facebook is doing enough to satisfy his concerns.<br />White House press secretary Jen Psaki echoed Mr. Biden’s apparent effort to lessen tensions with Facebook. “We’re not in a war or a battle with Facebook. We’re in a battle with the virus,” she told reporters on Monday."
