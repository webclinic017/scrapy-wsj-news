    "body": "The rise in Covid-19 cases driven by the Delta variant is prompting school districts across the country to consider changing their face-mask requirements, in an effort to stick to their plans to bring back students for in-person learning this fall.<br />With just weeks until the first day of school, debates are raging over a matter that seemed settled earlier this summer—whether to require face masks, or ban such requirements. Districts, however, aren’t considering a return to remote learning.<br />Several big city districts, including in Chicago, Atlanta and New Orleans, said last week they will require masks when schools reopen for in-person learning.<br />Atlanta Public Schools, where students return on Aug. 5, said on Thursday it had decided to mandate masks indoors, due to a low vaccination rate and the rapid spread of the Delta variant. Just 18% of eligible students are fully vaccinated, and about 58% of employees are or plan to be fully vaccinated, the district said, citing data from the Fulton County Board of Health.<br />The district said its decision was also influenced by recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, which earlier this month said that anyone over the age of 2 should wear a mask in school, regardless of vaccination status, because large groups of students aren’t yet eligible for vaccines. No vaccines have been approved for children under the age of 12."
