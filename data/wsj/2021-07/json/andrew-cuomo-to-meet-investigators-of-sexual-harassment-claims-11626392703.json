    "body": "ALBANY, N.Y.—New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo will be questioned on Saturday by state investigators as part of a probe into accusations that the Democratic governor sexually harassed multiple women, people familiar with the matter said.<br />Five current and former state employees have publicly accused Mr. Cuomo of inappropriate workplace conduct during his nearly 11-year tenure as governor. He has denied wrongdoing and apologized if his behavior offended anybody.<br />The investigators, overseen by Attorney General Letitia James, are examining the sexual harassment claims as well as Mr. Cuomo’s office environment and how his administration acted after the women came forward. The investigation began on March 1.<br />The impending interview is a sign of progress for Ms. James’s probe, said lawyers representing people aiding the inquiry, though she has declined to set a timeline. Investigators have already interviewed the women as well as current and former state officials and members of the governor’s State Police security detail, witnesses and their lawyers said.<br />Mr. Cuomo has rebuffed calls for his resignation and is raising money to campaign for a fourth term next year. He has said he is focused on his job, and this week appeared with officials in Brooklyn to announce an antigun violence initiative."
