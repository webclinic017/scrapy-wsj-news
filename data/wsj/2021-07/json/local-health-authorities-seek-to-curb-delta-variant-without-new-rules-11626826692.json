    "body": "Local health authorities in hot spots around the U.S. are seeking to blunt the highly contagious Delta variant of Covid-19 by trying to boost stagnating vaccination rates while largely stopping short of reinstituting rules and restrictions.<br />During previous surges, state and local leaders attempted a variety of approaches to slow infections. They instituted mask mandates, shut down public spaces and ordered businesses to close or run at limited capacity, in efforts to buy time until vaccines arrived.<br />Now, many leaders are focused on campaigns of persuasion and education. In some places, frustration is mounting at the slow pace of vaccinations, while infections are accelerating.<br />“I’m mad, I’m upset, I’m depressed because we’re going to watch people needlessly die over the next month or two for no good reason,” Thomas Dobbs, Mississippi’s state health officer, said at a briefing Tuesday.<br />Thirteen hospitals in the state have run out of ICU capacity, and many others have less than 10% of beds available, Dr. Dobbs said. Mississippi has one of the nation’s lowest vaccination rates, with 33.8% of the population fully vaccinated, federal data show."
