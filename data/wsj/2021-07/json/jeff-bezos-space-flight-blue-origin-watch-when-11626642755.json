    "body": "Jeff Bezos has big ambitions in space. The  Amazon.com Inc.  founder plans to make his own first visit with a flight scheduled to launch at 9 a.m EDT on July 20, the 52nd anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing.<br />The New Shepard rocket and capsule that will carry Mr. Bezos and three others was developed by his Blue Origin company, named for the belief that this blue planet is just the starting point for humankind’s future.<br />Mr. Bezos is putting himself to the test on his rocket’s inaugural crewed flight. He has said he hopes this will be the first of thousands that can make space travel safe and routine, and cheap enough to allow millions to follow. Eventually.<br />Richard Branson’s  Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc.  also plans to take tourists to space after flying its founder there earlier this month. Blue Origin aims eventually to use its space exploration to tap the energy and material resources of the solar system to save this planet.<br />The flight is scheduled for 9 a.m. EDT Tuesday and will be livestreamed by Blue Origin starting at 5.30 a.m. on outlets including wsj.com. Weather or technical glitches could delay the launch from Van Horn, Texas. The current forecast shows a slight chance of rain that is expected to clear in time."
