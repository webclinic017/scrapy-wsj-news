    "body": "FRANKFURT—The European Central Bank signaled that it would support the eurozone economy by keeping interest rates low for longer as a surge in Covid-19 cases driven by the highly contagious Delta variant triggers new social restrictions and weighs on the region’s large tourism industry.<br />The ECB’s move is in part a response to its new policy framework, unveiled two weeks ago, which aims to give bank officials broader powers to stimulate the economy when inflation is too low.<br />The central bank said in a statement that it won’t increase its key interest rate, currently set at minus 0.5%, until inflation moves much closer to its target of 2% and looks likely to remain at that level. “This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target,” the bank said. The ECB had previously given a looser commitment to hold interest rates until inflation looked likely to hit its target within a few years.<br />While a surge in prices has stirred fears the U.S. is entering an inflationary period, the eurozone has long been mired in low inflation, despite years of ultra loose monetary policy.<br />The ECB also reiterated its pledge to buy eurozone debt under an emergency €1.85 trillion bond-buying program, equivalent to $2.2 trillion, through at least March 2022."
