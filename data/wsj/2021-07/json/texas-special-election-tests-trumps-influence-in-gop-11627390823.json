    "body": "A special election in Texas on Tuesday is expected to test the power of former President Donald Trump’s endorsement in a runoff between two Republicans.<br />Mr. Trump has backed Susan Wright, the widow of the late GOP Rep. Ron Wright, who died in February at the start of his second House term after battling Covid-19 and cancer. She is squaring off against state Rep. Jake Ellzey, a fellow Republican and former Navy fighter pilot, after no Democrats advanced from the crowded jungle primary in May.<br />Mrs. Wright finished first among 23 candidates in the May 1 special election, with just over 19% of the vote, topping Mr. Ellzey’s roughly 14% share, according to the Texas Secretary of State. Mr. Trump endorsed Mrs. Wright in late April and reiterated his support for her at a virtual tele-rally Monday night.<br />“She has my complete and total endorsement,” Mr. Trump said Monday night, praising her late husband as well. “Susan will carry on his legacy and stand up to the radical left and fight for our America First agenda.”<br />If she won, Mrs. Wright would be the second Covid widow elected this year. In March, Rep. Julia Letlow (R., La.) won a special election to fill the seat vacated when her husband, Luke, died in late December just days before he was set to be sworn in for his first term."
