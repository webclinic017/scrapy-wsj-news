    "body": "HONG KONG—Despite a solid economic performance in the second quarter of the year, Chinese policy makers are expected to walk a fine line between supporting growth amid rising downside pressures and letting the economy run its course as they pivot to tackle longer-term challenges.<br />China said its economy expanded by 7.9% in the three months ending June compared with a year earlier. Monthly readings of industrial output, retail sales, fixed-asset investment and urban unemployment all met or topped expectations in June, keeping China on track to meet the official full-year growth target of 6% or more.<br />Averaging growth rates from the past two years to strip out pandemic-induced statistical distortions, China’s economy expanded by 5.5% in the second quarter—higher than the average 5% growth rate for the first quarter of the year, and drawing close to the pre-pandemic trend line.<br />But beneath the robust growth numbers lurk mounting risks for the economy, including an expected tapering off in global demand for Chinese goods, slower investment in manufacturing and real estate, and the threat of fresh Covid-19 outbreaks that could weigh on domestic consumption.<br />China’s economic rebound also remains unbalanced, with domestic demand languishing while factory production and exports propel the economy."
