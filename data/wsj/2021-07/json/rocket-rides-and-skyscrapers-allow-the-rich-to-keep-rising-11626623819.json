    "body": "Rich people keep trying to one-up each other. Going up and up and up.<br />Richard Branson’s recent space flight—and his decision to launch days before Jeff Bezos’ own mission to space planned for Tuesday—fits in a centuries-old tradition of wealthy people racing to the top, literally.<br />It goes back at least to the 13th century, when Italian noble families competed to erect ever-taller towers on their palazzi. And the race continues today on Manhattan’s skyscraping Billionaires’ Row and among well-heeled mountain climbers who compete to tick off the world’s highest peaks.<br />Now, space is the final status frontier. It has the added allure of exclusivity, since there are so few ways to get there—or places to visit. And even in space, altitude brings bragging rights.<br />Mr. Branson flew 53.5 miles up, past what the U.S. government considers the edge of space. Mr. Bezos intends to ascend more than 62 miles, or 100 kilometers, crossing the so-called Karman Line, which is internationally recognized as the start of space."
