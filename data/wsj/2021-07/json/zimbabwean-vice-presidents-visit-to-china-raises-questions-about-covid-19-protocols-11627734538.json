    "body": "BEIJING—Hundreds of people were removed from a luxury hotel in central Beijing and quarantined after a member of a group staying there with Zimbabwe’s vice president tested positive for Covid-19, hotel guests and authorities from both countries said.<br />The case has raised questions in China, a close ally of Zimbabwe, about whether authorities kept information about the infection from the public. The infection hasn’t been listed on the country’s national list of coronavirus cases.<br />Zimbabwe’s vice president, Constantino Chiwenga, who also serves as health minister, arrived in Beijing by chartered jet on July 23 with four other officials to receive medical treatment for a throat problem, according to officials with the Zimbabwean health ministry.<br />Two members of Mr. Chiwenga’s initial entourage were unable to join the trip after testing positive for Covid-19, the officials said, adding that the vice president and others who traveled with him had received two doses of a vaccine made by China’s Sinopharm.<br />A senior Zimbabwean security official confirmed that a member of the group tested positive after arriving in China, but said it wasn’t the vice president."
