    "body": "Generate Capital has raised $2 billion in new money to back clean energy projects, getting an endorsement from existing and new investors for its infrastructure-as-a-service model.<br />Australian investment firm QIC Ltd. and pension fund AustralianSuper led the fundraising, while other early investors in Generate, like Swedish pension system Andra AP-fonden and the U.K.’s Railways Pension Scheme, also participated, Generate said.<br />New investors included Birmingham, Ala.-based investment firm Harbert Management Corp., CBRE Caledon Capital Management, a private-equity firm in Toronto; and Aware Super, another Australian pension fund.<br />San Francisco-based Generate, which focuses on sustainable infrastructure, doesn’t raise traditional private-capital funds. Instead, it expands its asset base by allowing investors to buy stakes in the firm  itself, and then invests balance-sheet capital in projects like solar farms, waste-recycling systems and hydrogen-fuel plants.<br />Generate will use the new money to expand beyond North America into other regions, including Europe, and into sectors like water and agriculture, said Generate Chief Executive Scott Jacobs."
