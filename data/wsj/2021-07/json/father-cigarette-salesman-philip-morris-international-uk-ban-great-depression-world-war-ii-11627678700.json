    "body": "If my dad were still alive and were to read this week’s news about  Philip Morris International ,  he would think he had stepped into the Twilight Zone.<br />The company announced that it has asked the U.K. government to banish the sale of tobacco products in the next 10 years. CEO Jacek Olczak said that “I want to allow this company to leave smoking behind.”<br />It was probably inevitable. With cigarette packages required to feature labels telling customers the product inside will make them die, Philip Morris International’s stance is the corporate version of “Stop me before I kill again.”<br />Which brings us to my late father, and to the job he was able to find as a young man during the Great Depression—a job that sounds just about impossible today.<br />He’d had to drop out of school because his own father was very ill, and he needed to support his mother. Philip Morris hired him, for $18 a week, to travel the northwest quadrant of Ohio and hand out free samples of cigarettes. There was no real controversy about smoking in those years—it was just something that people did, like drinking  Coca-Cola  or eating hot dogs. His duties included restocking stores, saloons and candy shops."
