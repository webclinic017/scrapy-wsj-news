    "body": "Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.’s  shares hit a record high Wednesday as the burrito chain expressed confidence about growth, saying customers are returning to its dining rooms to eat out despite higher menu prices.<br />Sales for the company’s quarter ended in June outpaced the same period before the pandemic, with more people eating out again, particularly at lunch, the company said.<br />“It was pretty amazing to see how quickly the consumer showed up,” Chipotle’s CEO Brian Niccol said Tuesday.<br />Chipotle’s shares rose nearly 12% to $1,755.99 on Wednesday; earlier in the session, the stock marked a record high of $1,778.29. Chipotle’s shares, which have been trading for more than 15 years, are up more than 50% over the past year.<br />Investors are closely watching whether consumers are returning to restaurants amid inflationary pressures that have made going out to eat more costly and possible hesitancy related to the highly contagious Delta variant of Covid-19."
