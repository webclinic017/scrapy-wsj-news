    "body": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is set to return to Capitol Hill Thursday for a second day of testimony on the economy and monetary policy, this time before the Senate Banking Committee.<br />On Wednesday, Mr. Powell said inflation has been higher and more persistent than expected, but he repeated his view that recent price pressures would fade over time.<br />Pandemic-related bottlenecks and other supply constraints created “just the perfect storm of high demand and low supply” that led to rapid price increases for certain goods and services, he said.<br />U.S. consumer prices continued to accelerate in June at the fastest pace in 13 years as the recovery from the pandemic gained steam. The Labor Department reported Tuesday that its consumer-price index increased 5.4% in June from a year earlier. Excluding volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 4.5% from a year earlier, the most in 30 years.<br />Mr. Powell said Wednesday it would be a blunder to raise interest rates to address one-time increases in the prices of certain services, like air travel and hotel rates, or goods, like new and used cars, that have surged due to the reopening of the economy."
