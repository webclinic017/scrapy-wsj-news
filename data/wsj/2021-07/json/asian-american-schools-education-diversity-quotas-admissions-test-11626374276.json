    "body": "After Idi Amin’s 1972 ultimatum, my family left Uganda in the Indian exodus with $500, two suitcases and a plane ticket. Purged in an overt act of discrimination and escaping with our lives, we ran from the country we had helped build for generations. Now discrimination against Asians will again affect my family. William McGurn’s “A PTA Purge of Asians” (Main Street, July 13) presents clear evidence of discrimination in the name of equity.<br />I grew up in tenement housing and attended public schools of less-than-high standing, but I had two parents with strong family values, a work ethic ingrained by the examples of the adults around me and a cultural ethos that education was essential. By living wholesome lives, with the benefit of Western liberty and with hard work in the pursuit of happiness, we endured. This cannot be considered privilege.<br />The purging of high-achieving Asian students at Virginia’s Thomas Jefferson High School, at the top high schools in New York, even at the acclaimed test-in public high school here in Buffalo, N.Y., as well as the highly nebulous practices at Harvard, Yale and other elite universities, is not the grace that this country extended to us Asians 50 years ago. Equity cannot be achieved with discrimination. Justice is empty without basic fairness. America and the American dream are unsustainable platitudes without meritocracy.<br />The irony is that my children, who have worked hard and attended elite universities, have four generations of African ancestors—but they are not black. For this reason, they and their children will have to endure new purges. For them and America, I am heartbroken.<br />Saurin R. Popat, M.D."
