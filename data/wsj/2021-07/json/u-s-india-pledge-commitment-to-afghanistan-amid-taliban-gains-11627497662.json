    "body": "NEW DELHI—Top diplomats from the U.S. and India said the two countries were committed to resolving the conflict in Afghanistan, while acknowledging the Taliban have made new territorial gains, sparking fears in New Delhi about an increase in terrorism.<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit to India was partly aimed at reassuring an important Asian partner as the U.S. withdraws troops from Afghanistan. Speaking with his Indian counterpart Wednesday, Mr. Blinken said the U.S. maintained its diplomatic and economic commitment to the country.<br />In recent weeks, the Taliban have occupied critical border junctions with Pakistan and 212 districts—mainly rural, northern areas—out of 426 in the country, according to Indian officials. India and other countries in the region fear the territorial gains by the Taliban, which have had the backing of Pakistan, could make Afghanistan a breeding ground for terrorist activities.<br />India’s Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said on Wednesday that the consequences of the U.S. military withdrawal were inevitable. “What is done is done,” he said. “It is a policy taken, and I think in diplomacy you deal with what you have.”<br />Mr. Jaishankar said there is broad consensus that the conflict requires a diplomatic rather than a military resolution."
