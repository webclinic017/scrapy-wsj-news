    "body": "BEIRUT—Lebanon’s prime minister-designate Saad Hariri on Thursday abandoned his nine-month effort to form a government, deepening a political crisis as the country struggles with a cratering economy and medical shortages amid a global pandemic.<br />President Michel Aoun tasked Mr. Hariri in October with forming a new government after the last one collapsed in the aftermath of the deadly Beirut explosion in August that destroyed much of the capital. Mr. Hariri is the second prime minister-designate to give up trying to form up a government amid a deadlock among the country’s ruling elite.<br />“May God save the country,” Mr. Hariri said as he announced his resignation following a meeting with the president.<br />Mr. Hariri said his resignation was the result of not being able to agree with Mr. Aoun, Lebanon’s octogenarian president who controls the largest Christian bloc in Parliament.<br />The prime minister-designate and president had sparred over the allocation of portfolios in the cabinet, according to Mr. Hariri’s media adviser. The president in a statement shared on Twitter said Mr. Hariri wasn’t willing to discuss amendments to his proposals."
