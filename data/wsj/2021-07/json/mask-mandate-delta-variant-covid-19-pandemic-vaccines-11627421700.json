    "body": "U.S. authorities are getting another chance at mask advice with the upwelling of the Delta variant. Will they get it right this time—by which I mean achieving not an angry social meme but giving guidance that will actually have good practical effect?<br />Reduced to a nugget of precision, the best words right now might be: If you are an unvaccinated or otherwise vulnerable person, keep a distance from people who aren’t wearing masks.<br />Everything else is fine print. If you are a vaccinated person going about your business in most respects, it is not your job to compensate for others’ unwillingness to be vaccinated. If you are attending on a vulnerable person, wear a mask. Because children under 12 are not eligible for the vaccine and are at extremely low risk from Covid, their caregivers should be vaccinated or find other work.<br />The Delta variant has collided with our lousy monitoring system, based on biased voluntary testing to tell us how many have gotten Covid.<br />Delta is clearly spreading among the fully vaccinated, but we have no idea how extensively because people with mild or asymptomatic cases are unlikely to seek testing."
