    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden said he would nominate Jonathan Kanter to run the Justice Department’s antitrust division on Tuesday, turning to a vocal critic of Google as his administration has taken an aggressive posture on enforcing antitrust laws across industries.<br />Mr. Kanter is a longtime antitrust lawyer who has represented companies that argue they have been harmed by the conduct of  Alphabet  Inc.’s  Google, which dominates internet search and advertising.<br />Google currently faces an antitrust lawsuit, filed by the Justice Department last year, that alleges Google uses a web of exclusionary agreements and other tactics to preserve a monopoly for its flagship search engine and related advertising business.<br />Google has denied the allegations, saying it has designed its products and services to improve experiences for consumers. A trial isn’t expected to happen until 2023.<br />If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Kanter would be the second critic of large technology companies to take a key antitrust enforcement post for the Biden administration, following Lina Khan, a progressive former law professor who is now chair of the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC and Justice Department jointly enforce U.S. antitrust laws."
