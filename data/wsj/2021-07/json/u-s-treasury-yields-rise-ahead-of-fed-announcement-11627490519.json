    "body": "U.S. government bond yields edged higher Wednesday after the Federal Reserve signaled it was getting closer to when it could start tapering bond purchases.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which helps set borrowing costs on everything from mortgages to corporate debt, settled at 1.259%, according to Tradeweb, compared with 1.254% just before the Fed’s policy statement and 1.235% at Tuesday’s close.<br />Short-term yields, which are especially sensitive to changes in monetary policy, also edged higher, with the yield on the 5-year Treasury note increasing to 0.739% from 0.694% on Tuesday.<br />Yields, though, retreated in after-hours trading, suggesting investors were continuing to assess the implications of the meeting while retaining a solid appetite for Treasurys.<br />Investors initially reacted to the Fed’s policy statement by selling Treasurys, focusing on a single sentence that suggested officials are thinking more seriously about reducing its purchases of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities."
