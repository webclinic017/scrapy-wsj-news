    "body": "The outdoor recreation industry and environmentalists are among those backing bipartisan legislation to use fines and penalties collected for environmental regulations to fund wildlife conservation efforts, including restoring habitats for struggling species.<br />The Recovering America’s Wildlife Act was introduced Tuesday by U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D., N.M.) and Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.), according to a spokeswoman for Mr. Heinrich’s office. The law would steer at least $1.3 billion annually toward conservation efforts.<br />The bill has support from environmental groups, sportsmen, conservation agencies and businesses who benefit from what the Outdoor Industry Association estimates is roughly $780 billion in consumer spending each year.<br />“Fish and wildlife need healthy habitats to thrive—enhancing our lives, supporting good jobs and providing many other benefits,” Bass Pro Shops founder Johnny Morris said. Mr. Morris co-chaired a panel that made recommendations to Congress in 2016 that helped lead to the bill.<br />National Wildlife Federation President Collin O’Mara called the proposal “by far the most important piece of wildlife legislation in the past half century,” saying it provides a much-needed source of stable funding."
