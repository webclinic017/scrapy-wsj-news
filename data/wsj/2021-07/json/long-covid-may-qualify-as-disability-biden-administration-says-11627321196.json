    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden said certain Americans dealing with long-term symptoms of Covid-19, commonly referred to as long Covid, may have a disability under civil-rights laws protecting them from discrimination.<br />The president said Monday during a Rose Garden ceremony marking the 31st anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act that the administration would take steps to support such people.<br />“Many Americans who seemingly recovered from the virus still face lingering challenges, like breathing problems, brain fog, chronic pain or fatigue,” Mr. Biden said. “These conditions can sometimes ... rise to the level of a disability.”<br />The administration released joint guidance on long Covid through the Department of Health and Human Services and the Justice Department, which said long Covid could be a disability under the ADA if it limits a major life activity.<br />The administration said such people might require special accommodations, such as additional time for students to complete a test if they have difficulty concentrating or allowing customers to sit down without losing their place in line."
