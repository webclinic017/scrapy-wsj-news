    "body": "Jared Kushner is returning to the private sector, heading up a money-management firm.<br />The son-in-law of former President Donald Trump and an ex-White House senior adviser plans to launch his investment firm as soon as this fall, according to a person familiar with the matter. His company, Affinity Partners, will be based in Miami, not far from the South Florida home where he and his wife, Ivanka Trump, moved after leaving the White House in January.<br />Affinity Partners is separate from Kushner Cos., the family real-estate business where Mr. Kushner served as chief executive officer before stepping down in 2017 after nearly a decade in that role. He is thinking about opening an office in Israel, the person familiar with the matter said.<br />It couldn't be determined how much capital Mr. Kushnerâ€™s fund is aiming to raise, what sort of assets he is targeting for investment or where he is looking to raise money. He is well-connected with high-ranking foreign officials and Wall Street executives.<br />During his time as a senior adviser during the Trump administration, Mr. Kushner forged relationships with senior government figures in the Middle East, including the Saudi Arabia crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. He was involved in negotiating an agreement to normalize relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, among other initiatives."
