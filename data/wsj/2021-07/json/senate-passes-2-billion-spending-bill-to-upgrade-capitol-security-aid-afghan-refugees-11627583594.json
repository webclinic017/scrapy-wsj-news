    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Senate and House voted overwhelmingly to pass a $2.1 billion supplemental spending bill to fund Capitol security upgrades and pay for emergency aid to resettle Afghan refugees who worked alongside U.S. troops.<br />The bill, which passed the Senate 98-0 and the House 416-11, was the product of bipartisan negotiations between Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, the panel’s top Republican.<br />Lawmakers said the additional resources were urgently necessary to pay costs incurred from the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, and to ensure the U.S. doesn’t abandon its partners in Afghanistan as American troops withdraw.<br />In all, the bill will designate more than $520 million to reimburse the National Guard for its deployment to the Capitol after Jan. 6, $100 million for Capitol Police, $300 million for Capitol security measures such as hardening windows and doors and installing new cameras, $42 million to cover Congress’s Covid-19 costs and $1.1 billion to help resettle Afghans.<br />Mr. Leahy estimated that the legislation will result in 8,000 new Afghan Special Immigrant Visas with changes to the program to improve efficiency."
