    "body": "<br />SEOUL—Kim Jong Un is a millennial himself, but the 37-year-old North Korean dictator is showing little tolerance for kids these days.<br />In a recent state-media reprimand, the Kim regime’s main newspaper ordered the country’s youth to speak the unadulterated North Korean language. That means clipping out unsanctioned foreign additions—believed to be largely borrowed from South Korea’s pop music and dramas.<br />Instead of nam-chin, a shortened South Korean descriptor for boyfriend, North Koreans have been told to use nam dong-mu, which translates as “male partner,” Seoul’s spy agency told lawmakers recently. The Kim regime has even frowned upon locals using the South Korean wording for embarrassment.<br />Such cultural and ideological slip-ups, the North Korean newspaper wrote, are more threatening to the country than gun-toting enemies."
