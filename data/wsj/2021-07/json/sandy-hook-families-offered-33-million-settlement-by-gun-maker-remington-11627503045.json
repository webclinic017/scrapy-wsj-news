    "body": "Remington Arms Co. has offered to pay nearly $33 million to settle claims that its marketing practices were in part responsible for the Sandy Hook school massacre that left 20 first-graders and six faculty dead, according to court documents.<br />The now-bankrupt gun maker proposed a settlement of $3.66 million apiece for nine families who lost loved ones in the 2012 shooting at the elementary school in Newtown, Conn., in a series of filings made in Connecticut Superior Court Tuesday.<br />Josh Koskoff, a lawyer representing the families, said they were considering their next steps.<br />\"Since this case was filed in 2014, the families’ focus has been on preventing the next Sandy Hook,” Mr. Koskoff said in a statement. “An important part of that goal has been showing banks and insurers that companies that sell assault weapons to civilians are fraught with financial risk.”<br />Lawyers for Remington didn’t respond to requests for comment."
