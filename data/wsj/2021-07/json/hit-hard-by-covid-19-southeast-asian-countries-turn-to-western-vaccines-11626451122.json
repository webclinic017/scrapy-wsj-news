    "body": "Developing countries in Southeast Asia are increasingly turning to Western vaccines as the pace of immunizations slows in the U.S. and supplies open up, marking a shift from a reliance on Chinese vaccines earlier in the year.<br />In recent days, Indonesia and Malaysia have said they expect to receive millions of doses of a vaccine developed by  Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  in the second half of the year. The Philippines has already started receiving doses of vaccines from  Moderna Inc.  and Pfizer, and expects millions more in the coming months.<br />The bulk of vaccines in Indonesia and the Philippines in the first half of the year came from China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd., and Malaysia had mainly relied on a mix of Sinovac and Pfizer. The countries haven’t cited concerns over Sinovac’s efficacy as a reason for taking up Western vaccines, though Indonesia recently said it planned to give a booster shot to healthcare workers who had received two doses of the Sinovac shot.<br />The pivot to Western vaccines comes as Covid-19 cases have been rising rapidly throughout the region and in other parts of the developing world as the highly contagious Delta variant spreads world-wide.<br />“There’s a shift,” said Chong Ja Ian, a professor of political science at the National University of Singapore. “The shortages and the effects of the hoarding are easing up a bit such that countries that want the Moderna and Pfizer are able to get it now.”"
