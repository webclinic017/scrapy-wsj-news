    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Senate confirmed former Federal Reserve economist Nellie Liang as the Treasury Department’s undersecretary for domestic finance, putting her at the forefront of efforts to manage the soaring federal debt.<br />Ms. Liang, who specialized in financial stability issues at the Fed, was confirmed by a vote of 72-27. She will  oversee U.S. fiscal policy at a time when the Biden administration is proposing trillions of dollars in new spending on infrastructure and antipoverty programs.<br />The Congressional Budget Office projects a budget deficit of $3 trillion this fiscal year—more than it forecast in February, but less than the $3.2 trillion deficit in fiscal year 2020. The non-partisan agency expects the federal debt to grow to 103% of gross domestic product at the end of 2021.<br />Ms. Liang was nominated by former President Donald Trumpto a seat on the Fed’s seven-member board of governors in 2018, but her nomination ran into opposition from Senate Republicans. She withdrew from consideration in early 2019.<br />She served most recently as a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, the Washington think tank where Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen worked after leaving the Fed in 2018."
