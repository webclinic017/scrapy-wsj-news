    "body": "WASHINGTON—Several House Republicans flouted rules reimposing mask requirements on the House floor to stop the spread of Covid-19, with some GOP lawmakers angrily denouncing the new effort while congressional leaders traded insults.<br />Rep. Warren Davidson (R., Ohio), a member of a conservative caucus that has formally come out against mask mandates, walked through a magnetometer Wednesday morning without a face covering. A guard told him: “You need a mask.” He replied: “Thanks for offering,” and marched into the chamber.<br />Two more maskless Republicans followed him in.<br />“It’s gonna be a day,” one guard said to another.<br />The new mask guidance from the Capitol’s Office of the Attending Physician, coming just weeks after it had dropped its masking requirements for fully vaccinated people, touched off new partisan sniping in Congress, where many Republicans oppose mask mandates while Democrats support the requirements."
