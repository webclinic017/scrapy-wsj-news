    "body": "SYDNEY— BHP Group Ltd. ’s chief executive earlier this year reminded investors that mining companies that bet big on new production during a commodity-price bull run often end up regretting it.<br />On Tuesday, the world’s biggest mining company backed up that message by forecasting a flat outlook for its output over the next 12 months.<br />Global miners are continuing to favor profit and investor returns over investment in new projects that could ease concerns about future shortages of some commodities.<br />Iron ore and copper prices have hit records this year and are fattening producers’ profits, including at BHP. The world’s top 40 miners are expected to report a combined net profit of roughly $118 billion in 2021—up from $70 billion in 2020 and $61 billion in 2019—making it one of the best years on record, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.<br />However, BHP is continuing to be cautious with investments even as it pays large dividends to shareholders. It expects group output in the 12 months through June 2022 to broadly match the previous year’s as production from new mines and oil and gas fields mostly offsets dwindling resources at some existing operations."
