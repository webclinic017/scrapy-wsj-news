    "body": "POMONA, N.Y.—Eric Brodkowitz’s baseball career was finished. He had just pitched his final game at Yale and had no pipe dream of playing in the big leagues. He was taking his talents to Goldman Sachs.<br />Then he received another job offer: pitching for Israel’s national baseball team.<br />He would have to become an Israeli citizen. He would have to travel to countries like Bulgaria and Lithuania just so the team could qualify for the chance to qualify for the Olympics. He would have to move to Idaho and pitch for an independent-league team to stay in shape. And there was no guarantee that he would make the team even if Israel did somehow make the Olympics.<br />He decided to do it anyway. And he never stopped working for Goldman.<br />“I’ve sort of proven that I can work effectively remotely,” Mr. Brodkowitz says from Team Israel’s practice stadium in Rockland County, N.Y., where the mostly American-born squad was based before playing a series of exhibitions in the U.S."
