    "body": "Supermarket chain  Albertsons  Cos. is preparing for a potential return of Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns as the Delta variant pushes up the number of cases across the country.<br />“We’re starting to talk about it. We will be prepared,” Albertsons Chief Executive Officer Vivek Sankaran said in an interview, noting that the seven-day average of daily new cases is similar to that of a year ago. “We should not ignore that.”<br />Nationally, new Covid-19 cases are on the rise despite nearly 60% of the adult population having been vaccinated. The U.S. was averaging about 40,240 new cases a day as of July 23, up from about 27,440 cases the week prior, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Delta variant accounts for about 83% of Covid-19 cases in the U.S.<br />Grocers have wrestled with enforcing mask mandates for customers and staff over the past year, as some consumers refused to use coverings or wear them properly. This left store employees to manage confrontations over policy enforcement. Many retailers eased rules in the spring and haven’t changed their policies since.<br />Boise, Idaho-based Albertsons, whose grocery chains include Safeway and Jewel-Osco, is also studying mask and vaccine mandates, Mr. Sankaran said."
