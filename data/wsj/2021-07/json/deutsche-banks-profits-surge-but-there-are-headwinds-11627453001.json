    "body": "Deutsche Bank AG’s results signaled that the bumper profits accruing to its investment bank may have peaked, exposing the deeper challenges the lender faces two years into a strategic makeover.<br />The Frankfurt-based bank reported a drop in investment-banking revenue in the second quarter as booming client activity during the pandemic slowed down. Still, net profit surged compared with last year as its business lines held better than expected and the economic rebound in Germany put a lid on souring loans.<br />With the investment-banking business normalizing as the pandemic effects subside, focus will increasingly fall on the performance in its bread-and-butter lending business. Also important to investors: progress on its effort to cut costs.<br />Those cuts in particular are facing headwinds. Deutsche Bank on Wednesday dropped a specific 2022 cost-cutting target following unexpected regulatory levies that threw off its calculations. Its commitment to cut 18,000 jobs by 2022 has also loosened. Instead, the bank said it will focus on cost relative to income.<br />“There is no change in commitment and focus on costs,” Mr. von Moltke told reporters."
