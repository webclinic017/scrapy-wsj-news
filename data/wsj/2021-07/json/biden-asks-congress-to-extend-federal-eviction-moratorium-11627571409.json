    "body": "The Biden administration won’t move to extend a federal moratorium on the evictions of tenants who fell behind on rent in the Covid-19 pandemic in the wake of a court ruling, but it is asking Congress to authorize such an extension.<br />President Biden would have “strongly supported” a move to further extend the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s moratorium, scheduled to expire on Saturday, but that option is no longer legally viable after a recent Supreme Court ruling, the administration said in a statement by press secretary Jen Psaki.<br />State and local governments have struggled to distribute $47 billion in federal money aimed at helping tenants who can’t pay rent because of the pandemic-triggered downturn, leaving many people at risk of being forced out of their homes when the moratorium expires.<br />Just $3 billion of the aid authorized by Congress in December and March had been delivered to landlords and tenants as of June 30, the Treasury Department said in a report last week. About 8.2 million adults were behind on their rent or mortgage as of July 5 and have low confidence they can pay on time next month, a Census Bureau survey showed.<br />Ms. Psaki said the CDC moratorium was ending at a time of heightened vulnerability for tenants as the Covid-19 Delta variant continued to spread in many parts of the country, but she said congressional action was the only path forward."
