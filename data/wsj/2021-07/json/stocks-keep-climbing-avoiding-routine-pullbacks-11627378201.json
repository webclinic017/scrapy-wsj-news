    "body": "The stock market has been relatively quiet lately.<br />The benchmark S&P 500 hasn’t suffered a 5% pullback since October and has advanced 35% since the end of that month.<br />The last time the index enjoyed a respite of such length was from June 2016 to early February 2018 when stocks charged steadily higher before the 2016 presidential election and after Donald Trump’s surprise victory.<br />The brief selloff at the beginning of last week suggests there is anxiety percolating in the market, though.<br />Investors said they have been grappling with both the risk that a highly contagious variant of Covid-19 could threaten growth and indications that the Federal Reserve could dial back its easy-money policies sooner than expected."
