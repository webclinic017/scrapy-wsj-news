    "body": "ServiceMax has agreed to merge with a special-purpose acquisition company in a deal that will take the maker of software for field-service technicians public, the companies said Thursday.<br />The software company—whose current owners include private-equity firm Silver Lake,  General Electric Co.  and the venture arm of business-software giant  Salesforce.com —will merge with  Pathfinder Acquisition Corp.  in a deal that values ServiceMax at about $1.4 billion.<br />The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on the transaction.<br />ServiceMax has also inked a deal to buy LiquidFrameworks Inc., which provides field-service software to the oil-and-gas industry, from private-equity firm Luminate Capital Partners, for $145 million. It will finance the deal out of the roughly $335 million in cash proceeds resulting from the merger with Pathfinder.<br />SPACs raise money by going public as empty shells and then have a set period, usually two years, to find a business to merge with. The strategy, which can be quicker and have fewer regulatory hurdles than a traditional initial public offering, surged in popularity last year but enthusiasm has cooled of late."
