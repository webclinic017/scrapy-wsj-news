    "body": "Chevy Silverado owner Franko Dokaj stopped by his dealership recently expecting to buy new floor mats. Instead, he walked away with a killer deal: The store offered to buy his one-year-old truck for $3,000 more than what he originally paid for it last spring.<br />“I was like ‘holy cow’,” said Mr. Dokaj, who uses the truck for his car-detailing business. “This is something that I’ve never seen happen.”<br />Used-car prices, which have soared in recent months, are now defying economic gravity.<br />Once thought of as the ultimate depreciating asset, some car owners are finding their vehicles are worth as much as—if not more than—what they originally paid for them, dealers and analysts say.<br />And certain popular preowned models, such as the Kia Telluride and Toyota Tundra, are regularly selling for thousands of dollars more than the list price of the brand-new versions as auto retailers run historically low on preowned vehicle inventory, industry data show."
