    "body": "OPEC and a group of allied oil producers led by Russia are expected to meet Sunday, when delegates hope to agree to a deal to unleash millions of barrels of oil they bottled up at the start of the pandemic, as global demand recovers and crude prices rise.<br />Earlier this month, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a Russia-led group of non-OPEC producers—together called OPEC+—came close to agreeing to a deal to boost output starting next month. That deal was held up after the United Arab Emirates refused to sign on unless it was allowed to pump more of its own crude inside the complex quota system of the group.<br />Last week, Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de facto leader, and the U.A.E. agreed to lift that quota next year, paving the way for Sunday’s meeting and an official deal by the group to boost overall output. The deal that was hammered out earlier this month calls for OPEC+ to lift production by about 400,000 barrels a day each month into next year, eventually reaching the group’s pre-pandemic output.<br />It is unclear whether the group will agree on the exact same deal. Most big national oil companies have already committed to long-term sales for August, meaning they might not be able to start to unleash new barrels until September. Other OPEC+ members could be emboldened by the U.A.E. move to make demands of their own in Sunday’s meeting.<br />OPEC+ slashed production early last year, cutting 9.7 million barrels a day of its collective output, equivalent to about 10% of 2019 demand. It has restored about 4 million barrels of that."
