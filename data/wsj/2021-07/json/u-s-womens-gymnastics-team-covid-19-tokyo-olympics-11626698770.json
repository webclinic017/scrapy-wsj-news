    "body": "An alternate on the U.S. Olympic women’s gymnastics team tested positive for Covid-19 while in Japan on Sunday, team officials said, immediately creating anxiety around one of the most closely watched teams at the Tokyo Games that open this week.<br />The world-dominant U.S. women, led by superstar Simone Biles, are the strong favorites to take a third consecutive team gold medal at the Games. Biles is favored to take as many as four out of five additional individual gold medals.<br />The result was confirmed by USA Gymnastics, the national governing body of the sport, following announcements from city authorities of Inzai, the Japanese city where the women’s team is for a training camp before the Games begin Friday, as well as the U.S. Olympic Committee.<br />USA Gymnastics said that after the Covid protocols for the Games were reviewed, the local government put the gymnast who tested positive and one other additional alternate gymnast into quarantine.<br />The U.S. brought four women for the team event, as well as two gymnasts who are competing individually, as well as four replacement athletes. They had traveled at least part of their journey together from the United States to the same Japanese city for the pre-Games camp, to stay at the same hotel."
