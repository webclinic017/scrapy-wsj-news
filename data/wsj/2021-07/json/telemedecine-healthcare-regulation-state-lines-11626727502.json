    "body": "Ateev Mehrotra and Barak Richman should be commended for highlighting how outdated regulations restrict telemedicine across state lines for those who need it most (“A Cancer Patient’s Brutal Commute,” op-ed, July 13). To take the argument further: Healthcare services themselves should not be restricted by state lines. Reciprocity in licensing should be expanded, including for Medicaid coverage for children. Some children are forced to travel hours each week to remain within state lines and receive treatments in specialized hospitals, even though similar treatments are available minutes away in a neighboring state.<br />Indiana’s legislature recently passed legislation permitting children to receive specialized care in Chicago, Cincinnati and Louisville, Ky. Wise reforms won’t let outmoded reimbursement systems cause children to travel many hours for state-of-the-art care.<br />John Cunningham, M.D.<br />Chairman of Pediatrics, University of Chicago Comer Children’s Hospital<br />Chicago"
