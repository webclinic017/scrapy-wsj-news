    "body": "Bob and Melissa Mewis can still picture the scene in their Hanson, Mass., living room on July 10, 1999. They and their daughters—8-year-old Kristie and 6-year-old Samantha—were glued to the TV as the U.S. women’s soccer team outlasted China on penalty kicks to win the World Cup.<br />“The couch we had at the time was a fold-out,” Bob Mewis recalled. “So everybody was sitting on that fold-out couch, watching the game, and the girls were very excited.”<br />Like many of the roughly 7 million American girls playing soccer at the time, the Mewises dreamed of playing for the U.S. team. Each had a 0.00031% chance of making the Tokyo Olympics roster.<br />They both made it. Kristie, now 30 years old, and Samantha, 28, are the first sisters to play together for the U.S. in a world championship at any level. Even with the recent expansion of the U.S. squad to 22 from 18 under pandemic rules, Team USA is 9% Mewis.<br />The U.S. women begin group-stage play Wednesday [July 21] against Sweden, which knocked them from the 2016 Rio Olympic in the quarterfinals. Team USA aims to become the first to win Olympic gold on the heels of a World Cup title."
