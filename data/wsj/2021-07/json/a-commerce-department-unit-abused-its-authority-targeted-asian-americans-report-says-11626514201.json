    "body": "A security unit within the Commerce Department overstepped its authority in its investigation and surveillance of employees, actions that often targeted Asian-Americans, according to a recent Senate committee report.<br />The report is the result of a probe launched in February by Sen. Roger Wicker (R., Miss.), the top Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee, into alleged misconduct by the Commerce Department’s Investigations and Threat Management Service. The senator initiated the probe following complaints from more than two dozen whistleblowers, according to the report.<br />“The unit regularly disregarded the rule of law, committing gross abuses of power and misusing taxpayer funds to perform missions the unit lacked authorization to undertake,’’ the report said in its conclusion.<br />The unit was set up to help protect the commerce secretary and the department’s facilities by identifying agency vulnerabilities.<br />The report said investigations into threats facing the department led the unit to mutate “into a rogue, unaccountable police force without a clear mission.” The unit lacked the authority to conduct law-enforcement powers, the report said,"
