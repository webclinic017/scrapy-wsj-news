And it’s not as if they say it with the indulgent attitude your mother used to have—when she knew it was inappropriate but was kind of amused anyway. No, these people are not joking. They’ll kill your career, get your children to turn on you, dredge up your every purported misstep, and make sure all of it goes on your permanent record.<br />We’re talking a mentality that blacklisted the “Seinfeld” episode in which Kramer stomps on the Puerto Rican flag to put out the fire he’s set with a sparkler, and forced HBO to saddle “Blazing Saddles” with a dreary three-minute introductory spiel by an academic explaining to the unwary—i.e., idiots—that “racist language and attitudes pervade the film. But those attitudes are espoused by characters who are portrayed here as explicitly small-minded, ignorant bigots.”<br />No wonder that even non-edgy comedians like Jerry Seinfeld won’t go anywhere near a college campus. In a remarkable turnabout, today’s students have all the live-and-let-live joie de vivre of Dean Wormer from “Animal House.”"
