    "body": "Check your bank account. It may have jumped today if you have children ages 17 or younger—thanks to the Internal Revenue Service, of all things.<br />But before going on a splurge, find out if the extra dollars are truly extra for you. If they aren’t, you could be in for a bad surprise at tax time next year.<br />The IRS has now made the first of six monthly payments in 2021 to more than 35 million families with nearly 60 million children. These payments can be large: An eligible family with three young children could receive up to $900 per month for the rest of the year. The first round of payments comes to about $15 billion, according to a Biden administration official.<br />The payments spring in part from Congress’s March expansion of the child tax credit to as much as $3,600 per child for this year, up from $2,000 normally, in a bid to reduce child poverty. The expansion is just for this year and is expected to cost about $100 billion. Unlike a tax deduction, a credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction of taxes.<br />In a historic move, Congress also told the IRS to use existing records to send families monthly prepayments of part of their total 2021 child credits this year so they don’t have to wait to claim them on tax returns. Most payments will be by electronic deposit."
