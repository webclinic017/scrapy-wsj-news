    "body": "This month 10 of the best young female chess players in the country will compete in St. Louis for the title of U.S. Girls’ Junior Champion. It is the first in-person national championship among girls since the pandemic moved American chess online in early 2020. It is also the first such championship since the premiere of “The Queen’s Gambit,” the  Netflix  hit series about an orphan girl, Beth Harmon, partly based on American chess champ Bobby Fischer, who rises to the pinnacle of the chess world.<br />The tournament marks a transition point between Americans—especially American girls and women—and chess. Nearly half a century ago, Fischer’s Cold War shootout with the Soviet Union’s Boris Spassky ignited American passion for the game. But the Fischer phenomenon didn’t include women. Fischer even asserted in 1962 that women are “terrible chess players” and shouldn’t be involved in “intellectual affairs.”<br />The recent chess boom has brought new players to the game, and a higher percentage of women have been playing on chess.com since the debut of “The Queen’s Gambit.” Sales of chess sets have grown, as have the number of games played online, with millions of new members signing up.<br />Now, with life starting to return to normal, will interest in chess fade? And, in particular, will it fade for women and girls?<br />I think not. What we are witnessing is anything but a fad."
