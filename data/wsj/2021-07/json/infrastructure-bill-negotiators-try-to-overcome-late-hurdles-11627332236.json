    "body": "WASHINGTON—A push to complete a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure agreement hit a series of hurdles Monday, as aides squabbled over funding for water infrastructure and how to apply a requirement that federal contractors pay their employees a locally prevailing wage, among other issues.<br />Lawmakers had previously set Monday as a target for closing out their talks and beginning floor consideration of the emerging agreement, though that timeline seemed to slip as the two sides sniped at each other.<br />Democrats sent Republicans an offer Sunday night to try to resolve the remaining issues, which also include transit funding and repurposing Covid-19 aid for infrastructure, according to a Democratic aide familiar with the talks.<br />Republican aides panned the offer on Monday, accusing Democrats of backtracking on parts of the agreement.<br />The offer “was discouraging since it attempts to reopen numerous issues the bipartisan group had already agreed to,” a Republican aide familiar with the talks said."
