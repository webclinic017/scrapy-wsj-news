    "body": "Mary Anastasia O’Grady does an excellent job exposing the repression apparatus in Cuba (“Resistance and Repression in Cuba,” Americas, July 19). It is hard to understand those who admire the Cuban dictatorship, but some of my liberal acquaintances actually believe Cubans are better off under the communist regime, citing its healthcare and educational systems. More should be written to debunk these two myths.<br />The many people who have been apprehended and are now missing demonstrate what the reality is for Cubans, and their sacrifice will not be forgotten. They have already won by letting the world know that Cubans are not buying the “big lie” of the communist dictatorship.<br />Sylvia Hernandez<br />Duck Key, Fla.<br />"
