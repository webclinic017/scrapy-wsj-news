    "body": "The editorial board, usually a champion of free speech, gets it plain wrong on the threat to teaching history posed by bans on critical race theory (“The Teachers Unions Go Woke,” Review & Outlook, July 8). You claim these laws are harmless because “no one is opposed to teaching about America’s difficult racial history, including the evils of slavery and Jim Crow.”<br />That would be news to teachers in Tennessee, who are facing a revolt from GOP radicals over whether students should read about desegregation in “Ruby Bridges Goes to School.” In Texas, a new law requires slavery to only be taught as a departure from the founders’ ideals. How, then, would teachers broach the Civil War, Dred Scott, the Emancipation Proclamation, the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments or Juneteenth without fear of reprisal? It might also be news to the politicians who passed these laws with the explicit intent of prohibiting discussion about race and racism.<br />GOP operatives and their far-right media enablers, not educators, are trying to turn the teaching of honest history into a political wedge issue.<br />Randi Weingarten<br />President, American Federation of Teachers"
