Participants in the round included Japanese technology investor  SoftBank Group Corp. , Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital and Third Point, the hedge fund led by billionaire Daniel Loeb, FTX said.<br />The transaction vaulted FTX into the ranks of the world’s highest-valued crypto companies.
