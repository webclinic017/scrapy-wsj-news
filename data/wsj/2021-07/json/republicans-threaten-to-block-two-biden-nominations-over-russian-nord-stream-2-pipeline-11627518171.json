    "body": "WASHINGTON—A dozen Senate Republicans said Wednesday they plan to block two of President Biden’s Treasury Department nominations over the administration’s decision not to sanction Russia’s Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project into Europe.<br />The threatened action by the 12 Republican members of the Senate Banking Committee, which has oversight of the Treasury, could indefinitely hold up Senate approval of the two candidates nominated to lead the administration’s sanctions policy.<br />A Republican aide said the senators believe the two officials are qualified to serve. Brian Nelson was nominated to be the Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, and Elizabeth Rosenburg was tapped for the assistant secretary for terrorism financing post. Both positions are national security roles critical to implementing U.S. foreign policy through leverage of the dollar’s unparalleled power as the world’s reserve currency. The two have appeared before the committee, but a vote on their nominations hasn’t been scheduled.<br />The senators, in a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, said they would continue to block the nominations so long as the administration chose not to impose sanctions against the project, or until it “adequately addresses the absence of penalties.”<br />“We urge you to reverse course on Nord Stream 2 and join us in Congress’s longstanding defense of European allies and partners from malign Russian aggression,” the lawmakers said."
