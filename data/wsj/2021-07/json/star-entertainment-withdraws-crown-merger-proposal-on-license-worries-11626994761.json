    "body": "SYDNEY—The  Star Entertainment Group Ltd.  withdrew its indicative proposal to merge with  Crown Resorts Ltd.  over concerns its rival could lose its casino license in Melbourne.<br />Star on Friday said issues raised by Victoria state’s quasi-judicial inquiry into Crown’s suitability to hold a license generated too much uncertainty for the proposal to proceed. It also said it had limited engagement with Crown on the proposal.<br />“Issues raised at Victoria’s Royal Commission into Crown Melbourne have the potential to materially impact the value of Crown, including whether it retains the license to operate its Melbourne casino or the conditions under which its license is retained,” Star said in a statement.<br />Star said it continued to believe substantial benefits could be unlocked by a merger and that it was open to exploring potential value-enhancing opportunities with Crown. Star estimated that the combined company could reduce annual costs by up to 200 million Australian dollars (US$147.6 million) when it made the proposal in May.<br />There was additional potential to create significant value from deals such as a sale and lease-back of the combined group’s property portfolio, Star said."
