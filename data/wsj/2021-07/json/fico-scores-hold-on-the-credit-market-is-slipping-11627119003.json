    "body": "For decades, nearly every consumer credit decision revolved around a three-digit number—the FICO credit score. That is changing.<br />FICO has long dominated the market for consumer credit, providing scores for some 200 million U.S. consumers that are used by a whole host of lenders to evaluate credit-card, auto-loan and mortgage applicants. For borrowers, higher scores can mean bigger loans and lower interest rates.<br />But powerful forces are aligning to challenge its dominance.<br />Big lenders are moving away from FICO, according to people familiar with the matter.  Capital One Financial Corp .  and  Synchrony Financial  don’t use its scores for most consumer-lending decisions. They are becoming a smaller factor in some underwriting decisions at  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. and  Bank of America Corp.<br />A key financial regulator, meanwhile, is encouraging banks to de-emphasize credit scores in an effort to expand access to affordable credit. And housing-finance giants  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  are considering allowing lenders to use other scores when evaluating mortgage applicants."
