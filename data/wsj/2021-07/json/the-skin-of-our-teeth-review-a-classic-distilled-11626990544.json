    "body": "<br /><br />Philadelphia<br />Pretty much everybody knows Thornton Wilder’s “Our Town.” First performed in 1938, it is a great masterpiece . . . but it wasn’t his only one. Four years later came “The Skin of Our Teeth,” which had an even longer Broadway run (359 performances, 26 more than “Our Town”) and was promptly acknowledged as a no less major effort. Yet “The Skin of Our Teeth” doesn’t feel like a capital-M masterpiece. For all the high seriousness of its underlying themes, it’s funny, fanciful and, above all, optimistic, not quite what you’d expect of a wartime play whose protagonist, George Antrobus (Benim Foster), reminds us that “every good and excellent thing in the world stands moment by moment on the razor-edge of danger and must be fought for.” Powerful words for a grave hour: The play had its Broadway premiere 11 months after Pearl Harbor, and Wilder was right to say that it “comes alive under conditions of crisis.”<br />After dropping out of the active repertory for years, “The Skin of Our Teeth” has lately been re-embraced by regional companies that have found fresh ways to cope with its casting demands (the original production called for a 40-person ensemble) and are responding to its equally fresh timeliness. I’ve reviewed “Skin” three times since 2017, and now Quintessence Theatre Group, a Philadelphia company whose work is new to me, is streaming a scaled-down webcast version staged by Alex Burns in which the story of the Antrobuses, a 5,000-year-old family whom we see dealing with the Ice Age, the Great Flood and World War II, is told by 13 actors. To watch it as America emerges nervously from the pandemic cannot be other than tonic, and this exceptionally fine production is the right show for the right moment."
