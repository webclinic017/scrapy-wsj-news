    "body": "Robinhood Markets Inc.,  the app that brought the markets to the masses, closed down 8.4% in its trading debut Thursday after raising about $2 billion in one of the year’s most anticipated initial public offerings.<br />The company’s stock, listed on Nasdaq under the symbol HOOD, opened at $38 Thursday afternoon, in line with its initial offering price, and quickly fell more than 10%. The stock later climbed to approach the IPO price before falling again in the final hour of trading to close at $34.82.<br />A poor first-day performance is what Robinhood and its underwriters were trying to avoid by pricing shares at the bottom of its targeted range at a value of about $32 billion. The company and bankers wanted to be conservative to ensure a successful first day of trading, according to people familiar with the matter, in part because Robinhood sold a big chunk of its shares to small-time investors.<br />Breaking with a Wall Street convention to give individual investors only a minuscule slice of hot IPOs, Robinhood said it would allocate up to 35% of its offering to its own users. In the end, Robinhood customers got between 20% and 25% of the IPO, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />“One of our company values is ‘participation is power,’” Chief Executive Vlad Tenev said in an interview. “It didn’t seem right for us that IPOs had typically been reserved for the top 1%.”"
