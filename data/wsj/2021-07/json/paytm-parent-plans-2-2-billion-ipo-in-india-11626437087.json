    "body": "NEW DELHI—The company behind Indian mobile-payment app Paytm plans to raise up to $2.2 billion through one of India’s largest-ever initial public offerings, capitalizing on a boom in the country’s stock market.<br />As part of the share sale by One97 Communications Ltd., some of its big-name backers—including Jack Ma’s financial-technology giant Ant Group Co. —will trim their holdings, a filing showed Friday.<br />The IPO has a maximum size of 166 billion rupees, the equivalent of $2.23 billion. According to research firm Prime Database Group, that would make it India’s largest-ever IPO in rupee terms—although not in dollar terms, since the rupee has depreciated over the last several years.<br />One97 is seeking to be valued at least $25 billion via its IPO, according to a person familiar with the matter. It was last valued at $16 billion based on a private investment in 2019. Subject to regulatory approval, the IPO could be launched within the next few months.<br />The offering will be split half and half between new shares and stock sold by existing shareholders, including Ant and its sister company  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. ,  Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.,  and funds linked to Japan’s  SoftBank Group Corp."
