    "body": "In “Voters See Earthquakes and Lightnin’” (op-ed, July 22), Karl Rove is right about everything except his claim that President Biden has restored “normality and decency.” There is nothing normal or decent about the president’s assertion that Jim Crow is back in the form of state election-law changes. There is nothing decent in his dodging the substantiated charges of influence peddling by his ne’er-do-well son. There is nothing decent about his obdurate refusal to acknowledge the effect of President Trump’s warp-speed development of coronavirus vaccines.<br />Gerald Katz<br />Edwards, Colo.<br /><br />Mr. Rove cites “radicalization of K-12 curricula” as a political problem for Democrats. Radicalization may be too strong a word, but some proposed changes to social-studies standards in Virginia do seem highly politicized."
