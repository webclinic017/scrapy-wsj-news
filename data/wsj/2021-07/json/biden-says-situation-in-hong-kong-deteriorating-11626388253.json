    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden said the situation in Hong Kong is “deteriorating” as the administration prepares to issue an advisory to businesses that he said would lay out what may happen as China furthers its crackdown on the territory.<br />Mr. Biden didn’t give details on the advisory, which officials said may be released as early as Friday. Asked about the planned advisory during a press conference Thursday alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Mr. Biden said “The situation in Hong Kong is deteriorating, and the Chinese government is not keeping its commitment.”<br />The U.S. advisory is expected to be a warning for businesses rather than sanctions or other actions against China, according to people familiar with the advisory.<br />After months of antigovernment protests in Hong Kong, Beijing moved a year ago to impose a restrictive national-security law and arrest and intimidate pro-democracy activists and others critical of China’s rule. The U.S. says those moves violate the treaty ending British rule over the city, whose Western-style rule of law has helped make it an international financial and business hub.<br />The Trump administration rolled back certain travel and commercial privileges for Hong Kong that don’t apply to the rest of China and targeted officials with sanctions, including Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive."
