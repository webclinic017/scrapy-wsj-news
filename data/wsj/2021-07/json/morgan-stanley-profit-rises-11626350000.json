    "body": "Morgan Stanley  said Thursday that second-quarter profit rose 10% from a year earlier, thanks to a boost in fees from deal making and advising wealthy clients.<br />The New York-based bank reported profit of $3.51 billion, or $1.85 a share, on revenue of $14.76 billion. That exceeded the consensus estimates of analysts polled by FactSet of per-share earnings of $1.66 on revenue of $13.97 billion.<br />Like the other big banks that reported earnings this week, Morgan Stanley delivered strong results across several business lines on the back of corporate America’s rapid rebound this spring. Yet calmer markets, especially compared with the frenzied second quarter of 2020, dampened trading revenue, albeit to levels that are still high by historical standards.<br />At Morgan Stanley, investment-banking revenue increased 16% to $2.38 billion, thanks to a 44% rise in fees on advising on mergers and a 22% rise in fees on arranging stock offerings.<br />“Markets are open,” said Sharon Yeshaya, Morgan Stanley’s new finance chief. “Confident CEOs are able to talk to their boards on more strategic activities.”"
