    "body": "Credit Suisse Group AG  said it reached a settlement with a former executive and private investigators over a spying scandal that rocked the bank.<br />In fall 2019, the Swiss bank hired investigators to spy on Iqbal Khan, a top wealth-management executive who was leaving to join rival  UBS Group AG . Mr. Khan spotted one of the investigators and went to the police, setting off international headlines and leading to the ouster of the bank’s chief executive over the reputational fallout.<br />The settlement involves ending criminal complaints between Mr. Khan and the investigators and related legal action.<br />“All involved parties have agreed to settle. This matter is now closed,” a Credit Suisse spokeswoman said. A spokesman for Mr. Khan declined to comment. A lawyer for the investigators didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />Switzerland’s financial regulator, Finma, still has enforcement proceedings open against the bank over its surveillance activities. Credit Suisse was later found to have spied on other staff."
