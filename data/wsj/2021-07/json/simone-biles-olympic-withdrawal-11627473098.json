    "body": "TOKYO—Simone Biles was in the wrong head space to compete. She had already fallen. She had hurt her ankle. She tried to push on, but it became clear she was endangering herself by doing so. A choice was made: Biles would be withdrawn from the competition.<br />That was at a domestic meet in 2013. It foreshadowed the stunning turn of events at these Olympics, when the most dominant gymnast of all time left the women’s team final on Tuesday saying her state of mind was jeopardizing both her ability to safely perform, and the medal chances of her teammates. On Wednesday, she said she would not defend her individual Olympic all-around title either.<br />The gymnast who has shattered so many boundaries and assumptions about her sport has now shattered one more: She pulled herself from the biggest competitions in the world, one of them after it was already under way. She knew the eyes of the world were on her, was painfully aware of the judgment she could face. And she did it anyway.<br />The two incidents, almost a decade apart, reflect the evolution of Biles. Eight years ago, Biles had to be forced off the competition floor by her then-coach Aimee Boorman. In 2021, Biles insisted to team staff that she was removing herself.<br />Watching Biles’s warm-ups and vault on Tuesday, Boorman realized she had seen this before. And she was grateful to see it again."
