    "body": "Boeing Co.  Chief Executive David Calhoun took over the top job in January 2020 with a mandate to overcome the company’s management, engineering and production problems.<br />These have hobbled the manufacturer and allowed its European rival  Airbus SE  to displace it as the world’s biggest plane maker.<br />A year and a half into his tenure, new snags keep popping up.<br />Boeing said this week that it would slow production of its twin-aisle 787 Dreamliner jet to fix another manufacturing flaw, delaying deliveries that have largely been halted since last fall. It now expects to deliver fewer than half of the some 100 planes in its inventory this year.<br />Six weeks ago, Mr. Calhoun predicted at an investor event that the majority of them would be delivered by year’s end."
