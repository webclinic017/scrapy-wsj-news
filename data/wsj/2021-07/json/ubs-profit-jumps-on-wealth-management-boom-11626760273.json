    "body": "The booming business of managing rich people’s money boosted results for UBS Group AG, raising hopes that the Swiss banking giant will return more money to shareholders.<br />On Tuesday, Switzerland’s biggest bank said net profit jumped to $2 billion from $1.23 billion a year earlier, outpacing analyst expectations of $1.34 billion. It said wealth clients traded more, pushing transaction revenues 16% higher from a year earlier, and added that recurring fees were 30% higher on their existing trades and products.<br />At UBS’s investment bank, deal advice for mergers and acquisitions and other corporate transactions pushed global banking revenue 68% higher, helping to offset a 14% decline in market-trading income.<br />UBS helps wealthy people manage and invest their assets and competes with Wall Street banks in investment banking. It benefited during the pandemic as markets reflated and the fruits of the recovery accrued to companies and the world’s rich.<br />UBS released $80 million in earlier loan provisions after tweaking forecasting models to reflect an improved world economy. Executives said the bank would continue buying back shares under an existing program, and noted that capital is continuing to accrue above the bank’s target level for returning cash."
