    "body": "Regarding Ashley E. McGuire’s “It’s 98 Degrees Out. Why Is My Child Wearing a Mask?” (op-ed, July 10): The other day my heart broke when I saw my 4-year-old granddaughter’s class picture. Not a smile could be seen. She and all her little friends were wearing masks.<br />Is this really necessary? Long after teachers have been immunized, many schools are still mandating masks in the classroom. Is this about the science or progressive virtue signaling? Why do I feel as if someone from another political party is planting a campaign sign on my lawn?<br />Jon Fox<br />Linwood, N.J.<br />"
