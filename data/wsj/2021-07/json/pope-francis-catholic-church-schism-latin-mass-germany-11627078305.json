    "body": "Francis X. Rocca’s question “Is Pope Francis Leading the Church To a Schism?” (Review, July 17) is both moot and premature. The issues regarding human sexuality are de facto accepted by a large number of Germans. Official recognition by a synod would be counterproductive and unwise for the German hierarchy. It would push Rome into a corner, forcing a response that would divide the church. A more diplomatic solution, preferred by the Vatican, is to turn a blind eye, preserving a facade of unity.<br />At the moment, schism is much more a reality on the right. The pope’s restrictions on the celebration of the Tridentine Mass has engendered strong rejection by traditional Catholics. If they are enforced, many will sacrifice de jure Communion with Rome, believing they have a better case for legitimacy than the aberrations prevalent in Germany.<br />Rev. Michael P. Orsi<br />Naples, Fla.<br />"
