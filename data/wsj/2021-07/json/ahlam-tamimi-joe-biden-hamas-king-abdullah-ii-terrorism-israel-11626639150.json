    "body": "Jerusalem<br />Jordan’s King Abdullah II visits the White House Monday. We urge President Biden to ask him why our daughter’s murderer remains protected by his kingdom. We beg him to press for her extradition to Washington.<br />Ahlam Tamimi is an FBI Most Wanted Terrorist charged with participating in a 2001 bombing that killed 15, including our daughter Malki, 15, a U.S. national. Ms. Tamimi, an unabashed advocate for terrorism against Israelis and Jews, lives free in Jordan despite its 1995 extradition treaty with the U.S.<br />Malki and her friend stopped for lunch at a pizzeria in central Jerusalem and were at the counter when a Hamas human bomb, a young man carrying a shrapnel-laced exploding guitar case, entered. Ms. Tamimi, who later called this “my operation,” picked the site for throngs of children it attracted and brought him there, instructing him what to do and fleeing minutes before the thunderous explosion.<br />Arrested by Israeli forces and tried, Ms. Tamimi admitted all charges and was sentenced in 2003 to 16 life terms. But in 2011, she and 1,026 other convicts were exchanged by Israel for a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held hostage by Hamas. Stunned, we watched Ms. Tamimi’s arrival in Jordan on Oct. 18, 2011, to raucous receptions at Amman’s airport, in a courthouse and at the University of Jordan. Exultant media interviews underscored her utter lack of regret."
