    "body": "SÃO PAULO—Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was released from the hospital Sunday, four days after being hospitalized for an intestinal obstruction, his doctors said.<br />Mr. Bolsonaro first went to the hospital in Brasília on Wednesday after complaining of stomach pain and persistent hiccups. He was then flown to São Paulo later that day and admitted to the Vila Nova Star hospital.<br />Mr. Bolsonaro has had abdominal problems since his 2018 campaign for president, when a man stabbed him as the candidate was thronged by supporters in the street. Doctors saved his life in the operating room, and Mr. Bolsonaro recovered and went on to win the country’s highest office. Doctors have operated on him multiple times since the first surgery.<br />The president emerged from the hospital wearing a mask, and then removed it to speak with reporters outside the hospital entrance, defying a São Paulo-state mask requirement. He described feeling as if his stomach was on fire after several days of hiccups.<br />“I came here with a 90% chance of surgery,” he said. “Maybe because of the trip, maybe the shaking of the ambulance, maybe a miracle of God, because I believe in God, I improved and two days later surgery was ruled out.”"
