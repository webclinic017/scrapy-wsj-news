    "body": "NEW DELHI—With India’s hospitals under siege from a coronavirus wave in April, Mallik Manem found it nearly impossible to consult with a physician in the southern city of Hyderabad about care for his 81-year-old mother, who was sick with Covid-19. One harried doctor, Mr. Manem said, carved out five minutes to chat over the phone.<br />So the 55-year-old, who was himself ill with Covid-19, went online. Mr. Manem was able to consult with four doctors in the U.S. over video chats. One looked over lab results;  another recommended breathing exercises.<br />“It was just fantastic,” said Mr. Manem, an Atlanta resident who was in India visiting family. “Each doctor gave me at least 15 to 20 minutes of their time.” His mother has since fully recovered.<br />The role of telemedicine has grown in many countries since the start of the pandemic. Often it has allowed people to consult with physicians without leaving their homes during lockdowns and avoid spreading or contracting the virus. In much of the developing world with weaker healthcare systems, and particularly in India during the recent surge, telemedicine has played a far more vital role.<br />Telemedicine has almost become a replacement for in-person care in many cases in India, said Vikram Kapur, a partner at Bain & Co. who leads its Asia-Pacific healthcare practice. “There’s just not enough doctors and so many people needing care,” he said."
