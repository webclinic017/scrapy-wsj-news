    "body": "Former President Donald Trump has $102 million in political cash that he can wield as the GOP eyes retaking majorities in Congress next year, according to filings made Saturday night with the Federal Election Commission.<br />Mr. Trump raised nearly $82 million across all of his political-action committees during the first half of the year through June 30, the documents showed, with $62 million of that raised by Save America PAC, a leadership committee that also sends out Mr. Trump’s press statements and candidate endorsements.<br />The fundraising figures show that even after losing the 2020 election and being banned from multiple social-media platforms, Mr. Trump remains a draw for donations from Republican voters, particularly through email and text message solicitations.<br />Mr. Trump was particularly successful on the Republican donation platform WinRed. The platform’s public filing Friday showed Mr. Trump’s committees raised more than $56 million in online donations—more than any other GOP group on the platform during the first half of the year.<br />Some of that went to the Republican National Committee as part of a joint fundraising agreement with the Trump Make America Great Again committee. But the majority went to committees controlled by Mr. Trump—Save America PAC, his joint fundraising committees and MAGA PAC, his former campaign that has been converted into a multicandidate committee."
