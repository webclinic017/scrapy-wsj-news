    "body": "Apropos of Lance Morrow’s “The Hedgehogs of Critical Race Theory” (op-ed, July 20) wherein the single-minded racial ideology sees racism in every white face, let us also be reminded of the darker elements in our psyche. For self-gratification to be achieved, sometimes it is not enough that we should succeed, but that our friends should fail.<br />In the 1970s the clarion call was “Black is Beautiful.” Now it appears more important for many that whites be deemed ugly. As Mr. Morrow states, “Truth changes shape as it coalesces into a political movement and gets a taste of power.”<br />Albert Repicci<br />Riverside, Conn.<br />Lance Morrow bemoans the tyranny of the hedgehog, who knows one big thing. But perhaps more should be said about where the creature has made his lair: the social-science and humanities departments of academia."
