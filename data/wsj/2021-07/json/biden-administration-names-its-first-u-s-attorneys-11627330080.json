    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden put forward his first set of nominees to lead U.S. attorneys’ offices across the country, a group that includes a former fraud and public-corruption prosecutor who would oversee hundreds of criminal cases stemming from the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.<br />The eight picks unveiled Monday include the first Black Americans to lead several offices and at least one nominee known for taking progressive positions that could draw criticism from Senate Republicans. The chamber’s slim Democratic majority would suffice to confirm the nominees if the party doesn’t lose a single vote.<br />The nominations come as the Biden administration pursues a Justice Department agenda emphasizing enforcement of civil-rights and voting-rights laws, fighting domestic terrorism and combating rising gun violence, among other priorities. The department’s 93 U.S. attorneys will be crucial to carrying out that agenda in the field as they oversee prosecutions in their districts.<br />Mr. Biden’s prosecutor picks, six of whom are Black and three of whom are women, comprise a mix of law-enforcement officials with experience ranging from national security and cybercrime to civil rights and corruption. If confirmed, they would serve as top prosecutors in Maryland, Washington state, Indiana, Massachusetts, New York and the District of Columbia.<br />Mr. Biden tapped Matthew Graves, a former fraud and corruption prosecutor in the U.S. attorney’s office for the District of Columbia, to lead that office as it pursues charges against more than 500 people in connection with the attack on the Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters. Mr. Graves has been in private practice since 2016, representing large companies and executives in various government investigations."
