    "body": "HONG KONG—As China’s factory-gate prices soared this year, investors worried the country would become a new source of inflation for the rest of the world.<br />Instead, the world’s second-largest economy has helped alleviate some price pressures caused by the pandemic, and appears likely to keep doing so—at least for a while.<br />China’s own economy is far from overheating. So it isn’t really a main driver of the demand that is pushing up prices of commodities and consumer goods world-wide, economists say.<br />And while some Chinese factories have passed on price increases to Western buyers this year, many are also absorbing higher costs for raw materials like copper and iron ore themselves.<br />That has helped prevent consumer-goods prices from rising even higher elsewhere, though it has also meant lower profits for some Chinese factory owners."
