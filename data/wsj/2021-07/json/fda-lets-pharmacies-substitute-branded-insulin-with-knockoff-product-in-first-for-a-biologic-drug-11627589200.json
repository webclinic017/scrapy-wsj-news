    "body": "For the first time, U.S. regulators have said that a knockoff version of a biologic drug is interchangeable with its branded equivalent, a milestone in the yearslong effort to bring greater competition to the market for expensive biologic drugs.<br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday said the biosimilar insulin product Semglee is interchangeable with  Sanofi SA’s  Lantus, a designation that allows pharmacists to automatically substitute Semglee for prescriptions for Lantus, one of the top-selling insulins in the world.<br />Semglee is made by  Viatris Inc.  and Biocon Biologics Ltd. and was first approved by the FDA last year. But doctors would have to specifically prescribe the biosimilar version, rather than allowing pharmacists to substitute it for Lantus when filling the prescription. The companies said they would launch the product with new labeling on interchangeability before the end of the year.<br />A Viatris spokeswoman declined to disclose how much the company will charge for the interchangeable Semglee product.<br />The current list price for a pack of five Lantus injection pens is $425.31, a Sanofi spokeswoman said. When Semglee was originally introduced last year, the companies charged $147.98 per five-pen package."
