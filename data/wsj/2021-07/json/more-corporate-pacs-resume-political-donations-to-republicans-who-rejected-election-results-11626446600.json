    "body": "WASHINGTON—Big names in corporate America have resumed donating to Republican lawmakers who voted against certifying President Biden’s victory after the companies earlier announced pauses or reviews of their political donations in response to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.<br />New campaign finance filings show political-action committees for  Aflac Inc.,   American Airlines ,   Ford Motor Co. ,  General Motors Co. ,  Tyson Foods Inc.  and  United Parcel Service Inc.  were among those that made recent donations to the campaigns of some of the 147 GOP lawmakers. The filings made Thursday to the Federal Election Commission cover the second quarter ended June 30.<br />Other companies and trade groups such as  Boeing Co. ,  Lockheed Martin  Corp. ,  Northrop Grumman Corp. , the National Association of Realtors,  Cigna Corp.  and  JetBlue Airways Corp.  also have resumed corporate PAC donations to GOP objectors. Some of the donations disclosed in House and Senate filings Thursday had previously been made public, including some by Ford’s PAC.<br />The latest filings also show  Toyota Motor Corp.’s  PAC gave more than $85,000 to more than four dozen GOP objectors before announcing a halt to such donations last week. The company, whose decision was earlier reported by the newsletter Popular Information, has said it made the decision after listening to its stakeholders who were troubled by the donations.<br />The companies whose PACs have resumed donating weren’t among those that had made specific pledges not to give to the group of GOP lawmakers. Those companies, which include Amazon.com Inc.,  Walmart Inc.,   AT&T Inc.,   Nike Inc.  and  Mastercard Inc.,  have so far not made donations directly to those campaigns, FEC filings show."
