    "body": "TOKYO—Japan widened its state of emergency to the entire Tokyo region and extended it until the end of August in response to a Covid-19 outbreak that has erupted during the Tokyo Summer Olympics.<br />Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has said there would be no changes to the Olympics, which run through Aug. 8, and officials said there wasn’t a connection between the start of the Games on July 23 and the rapid rise in new cases. Nonetheless, the outbreak put a damper on the nation’s mood despite a string of gold medals won by Japanese athletes.<br />“The virus is spreading at a rapid pace beyond what we have seen before,” Mr. Suga said at a meeting of government ministers.<br />The current state of emergency, which started July 12, was limited to Tokyo proper and Okinawa, and it was set to expire Aug. 22. The government said Friday that effective Monday, the measures would be extended to the full Tokyo metropolitan region as well as Osaka. The state of emergency in Tokyo and the newly added locations will now last until Aug. 31.<br />In contrast to lockdowns in other countries, most of the restrictions under the state of emergency are voluntary. Restaurants and bars are being asked to close early and not serve alcohol."
