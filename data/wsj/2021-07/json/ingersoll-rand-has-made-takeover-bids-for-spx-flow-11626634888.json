    "body": "Ingersoll Rand Inc.  has made takeover bids for component maker  SPX Flow Inc.  that have so far been rebuffed, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The industrial-machinery company’s most recent all-cash offer valued SPX Flow in the low-$80s a share, the people said, or around $3.5 billion. SPX shares closed Friday at $62.09, giving the company a market value of about $2.6 billion.<br />Charlotte, N.C.-based SPX primarily makes components for machinery used by food-and-beverage and industrial companies. Ingersoll Rand, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of industrial pumps and compressors, has a market value of about $20 billion.<br />In 2019, the former  Ingersoll-Rand  PLC, then incorporated in Dublin, agreed to merge with Gardner Denver Holdings Inc. The deal combined Gardner Denver’s selection of compressor, pump, vacuum and blower products and services with the part of Ingersoll Rand that made similar tools and systems as well as equipment for lifting and material handling, and golf carts.<br />The remainder of the company—heating, ventilation and air- and temperature-controlled transport businesses—became  Trane Technologies  PLC."
