    "body": "General Motors Co.  is advising owners of its previously recalled Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles to once again park outdoors after two cars that had been repaired caught fire.<br />The auto maker said on its website that it is also advising the owners “out of an abundance of caution” not to leave their vehicles charging overnight.<br />The company didn’t release details about what caused the fires in the two cars but said it was investigating the incidents. GM said customers should continue to get the fix under the recall. In response to a request for comment, a GM spokesman emailed a statement similar to the announcement on the website.<br />The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the vehicles’ cell packs have the potential to smoke and ignite internally. The agency opened an investigation into the Bolt in October.<br />GM recalled in November nearly 69,000 Bolts from the 2017-2019 model years, including roughly 51,000 sold in the U.S. GM said then that it was aware the plug-in models had a fire risk related to the lithium-ion batteries. Under the recall, the company said at that time that dealerships would limit the batteries’ charging capacity to 90% until a permanent fix was found."
