    "body": "Throngs of vacation travelers and an infusion of government aid have restored  Southwest Airlines Co.  and  American Airlines Group Inc.  to profitability.<br />American and Southwest each notched a small profit during the second quarter when including government assistance aimed at covering the cost of paying employees. Southwest reported a $348 million profit during the quarter. American reported a profit of $19 million.<br />Excluding the government assistance, both airlines reported losses during the quarter: Southwest lost $206 million, and American lost $1.09 billion. The rise of leisure traffic in June, however, helped Southwest and American turn their first monthly profits without government assistance since the start of the pandemic.<br />The strength of the air travel rebound this summer outpaced what many airline executives had anticipated. Roughly two million people have passed through U.S. airports each day recently, according to the Transportation Security Administration.<br />That has helped lift airline revenues, but it also brought unanticipated challenges for carriers."
