    "body": "A red-hot housing market is enabling banks to sell a new kind of bond that shares the risk of mortgage and loan defaults with institutional investors.<br />Texas Capital Bank recently sold $275 million of securities to investors looking to cash in on the pandemic-fueled boom in home prices. The bonds are backed by short-term loans the bank makes to mortgage lenders. When those lenders’ borrowers default, the investors in the bonds effectively cover the loss.<br />The transfers are a product of the effort to shield  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  from the risk of a mortgage-market reversal. Banks are now using them to raise capital and otherwise shore up their balance sheets, a process that ultimately adds to their lending capacity, analysts said.<br />Banks including  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. and  Citigroup Inc.  have recently increased sales of risk-transfer securities tied to mortgages, auto loans and corporate debt. However, the entry of regional banks marks a new phase in the market’s expansion, said Simon Boughey, an analyst at Structured Credit Investor.<br />“The addition of Texas Capital Bank to the roster in March this year shows there is potential for this mechanism to grow,” said Mr. Boughey."
