    "body": "After Sunday’s unprecedented protests across Cuba challenging the  island’s dictatorship, the communist regime is still abusing its citizens. But in another rare occurrence, the regime is also beginning to acknowledge its role in creating their misery.<br />On Sunday the Journal’s Mary Anastasia O’Grady wrote:<br />Now the Associated Press reports from Havana that Prime Minister Manuel Marrero has announced measures to allow “Cuban citizens who go on foreign trips to bring home toiletries, food and medicines, which are among the most hard to find items in Cuba.” And there’s more from AP:<br />AP also notes new promises of reform from the regime:<br />In an awkward moment for leftists in the United States, even as the Cuban regime finally begins admitting some of its many grievous faults, its U.S. friends don’t seem to have received a copy of the latest talking points.
