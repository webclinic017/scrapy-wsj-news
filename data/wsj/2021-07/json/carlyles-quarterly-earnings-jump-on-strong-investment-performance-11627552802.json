    "body": "Carlyle Group Inc .  reported sharply higher second-quarter earnings as growth in the value of its private-equity portfolio outpaced the broader market.<br />The Washington, D.C., buyout firm reported a second-quarter net income of $925 million, or $2.55 a share. That compares with net income of $145.9 million, or 41 cents, in the same period last year.<br />The firm’s private-equity portfolio appreciated by 12% during the second quarter, besting the roughly 8% gain for the S&P 500. Carlyle’s net accrued performance revenues—a reflection of how its investments are faring and a closely watched gauge of future earnings—hit a record $4 billion during the quarter.<br />Carlyle’s second-quarter distributable earnings, or the portion of profits that could be returned to shareholders, came in at $395.4 million, or 88 cents a share. That compares with $198.4 million, or 53 cents a share a year earlier.<br />Carlyle and its peers—known for splashy leveraged buyouts but which also engage in all manner of investing activity—have benefited from rising markets as economies around the world emerge from coronavirus-related lockdowns."
