    "body": "NEW DELHI—Heavy monsoon rains have pummeled the western Indian state of Maharashtra, triggering landslides and flooding that have killed at least 113 people, according to the state government.<br />Maharashtra, home to the financial capital of Mumbai, has seen its heaviest July rainfall in decades. Days of downpours have made roads impassable and restricted access to villages across the state.<br />In Taliye, a village about 110 miles southeast of Mumbai, at least 43 people were killed by a landslide, said Nidhi Chaudhary, the Raigad district collector. Additional landslides killed at least 11 people in two other villages in the district.<br />Rescue teams are still trudging through thick layers of mud and flooded terrain to try to reach villagers trapped by mudslides in isolated areas, according to an official with the state’s disaster-management department. The Indian Army, Coast Guard and National Disaster Response Force are among the teams deployed in the rescue effort.<br />“Locations are remote, and it’s a mudslide,” the official said. “Hence, removal of people becomes more difficult.”"
