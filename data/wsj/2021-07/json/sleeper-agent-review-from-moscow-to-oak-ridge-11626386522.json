    "body": "Many Americans are familiar with the names of the Soviet assets Alger Hiss, Klaus Fuchs, and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Few, however, have heard of George Koval, a devastatingly effective atomic spy during World War II who walked away from his exploits completely undetected by U.S. intelligence. Now writer Ann Hagedorn has told his story in “Sleeper Agent,” a historical page-turner of the highest order.<br />In the fall of 1944, she writes, Koval, a 30-year-old American electrical engineer, could be found driving his U.S. Army jeep daily around the site of the Manhattan Project labs in Oak Ridge, Tenn. There and later in Dayton, Ohio, Koval, who five years earlier had been recruited by Soviet intelligence, obtained data from top-secret research facilities that would help to produce the enriched plutonium used in the first Russian A-bomb, detonated in August 1949.<br />Koval’s father, Abram Koval, was a Russian Jew who had fled the pogroms of 1910 and ended up in Sioux City, Iowa, a location chosen for him by a Jewish settlement organization. Soon Ethel Shenitsky also arrived in Sioux City, and she and Abram married in June 1911. Their son George was born on Dec. 25, 1913.<br />After 1919-20, the year of the Red Scare, many Americans viewed Jews as Bolsheviks, which inflamed the very anti-Semitism the Kovals had faced in Russia. Jewish emigration from Europe ground to a halt with the 1924 immigration law, and in Iowa the racist, anti-Catholic and anti-Semitic Ku Klux Klan grew to more than 40,000 members. Despite this, young George grew up a thriving all-American. A top student, he graduated from high school at age 15 and in 1929 moved to Iowa City to obtain a degree at the state university’s school of engineering. But after the Great Crash, George, disillusioned by capitalism, became active in the Young Communist movement, beginning a lifetime commitment to the Soviet experiment.<br />Abram Koval now wished to leave America and return to the home he had fled. Like other immigrant Jews, he’d heard about the creation of a Jewish autonomous region in the Soviet Far East called Birobidzhan. In May 1932, he left with his entire family, believing in the bright Jewish future the communists would build."
