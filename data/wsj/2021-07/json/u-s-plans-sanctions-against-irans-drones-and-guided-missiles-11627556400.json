    "body": "The U.S. plans a sanctions campaign against Iran’s evolving capabilities for precision strikes using drones and guided missiles, according to U.S. officials, amid concerns over the threat these weapons represent to American and allied interests.<br />The effort comes as Western security officials say they see those capabilities as a more immediate danger to Middle East stability than Iran’s nuclear-enrichment and ballistic-missile programs.<br />The U.S. has sanctioned some of Iran’s missile programs in past years, but officials said that targeting Iran’s procurement networks, such as the providers of parts used to build the drones and precision-guided missiles, could more effectively disrupt those activities.<br />“It’s part of a comprehensive approach so we’re dealing with all aspects of the Iranian threat,” a senior U.S. official said.<br />Top military and diplomatic officials say they have seen a major increase in the use of guided missiles and drones against U.S. forces and allies."
