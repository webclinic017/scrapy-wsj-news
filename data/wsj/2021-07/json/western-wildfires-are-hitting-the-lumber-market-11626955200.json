Now come the fires.<br />Forest fires raging in the West are threatening an important swath of the U.S.’s wood supply, pinching output that has been under pressure since the Covid-19 pandemic touched off homebuying and remodeling booms and sent lumber prices soaring.<br />Canfor Corp. , one of North America’s largest lumber producers, said that starting Monday it would cut back output at its mills in British Columbia because of hundreds of blazes that have broken out in the Canadian province and challenged its ability to shuttle wood to and from its facilities. The company expects to reduce output at its 10 operating mills there by a total of about 115 million board feet during the quarter.<br />That is only a sliver of North America’s overall supply. Yet analysts said they expected further curtailments because of fires that are scorching logging forests on both sides of the U.S.-Canadian border. In addition, lumber prices  have fallen below the cost of sawing boards in the continent’s most expensive place to process timber.<br />“The wildfires burning in western Canada are significantly impacting the supply chain and our ability to transport product to market,” said Stephen Mackie, executive vice president of Canfor’s North American operations."
