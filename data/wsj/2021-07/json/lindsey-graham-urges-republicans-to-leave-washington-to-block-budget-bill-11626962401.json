    "body": "WASHINGTON—Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) is pitching fellow Republican senators on a last-ditch gambit to block Democrats’ $3.5 trillion budget resolution: Skip town.<br />Mr. Graham believes a united Republican caucus can deny Democrats the 51 votes needed for quorum by leaving the capital en masse, citing the example of Texas Democrats, who fled their state to prevent the GOP-controlled legislature from enacting stricter voting laws. He said he is driven by his opposition to immigration provisions that Democrats might include in their resolution.<br />“If they put in amnesty in…that’s an assault on the system as we know it,” Mr. Graham said. “We should use any tool in our box to stop it.”<br />The Democrats’ plan is expected to set aside $120 billion for establishing a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers—immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children—as well as other groups that could include farmworkers, according to Senate aides.<br />Some GOP senators are open to the quorum-busting idea, but others are skeptical, leaving Mr. Graham with a lot of convincing to do. When senators tried a similar trick decades ago, Capitol Police physically carried one of the fugitive lawmakers back onto the floor. Senate Democrats scoff at the threat."
