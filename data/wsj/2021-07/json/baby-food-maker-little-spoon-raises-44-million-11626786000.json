    "body": "Little Spoon Inc., a direct-to-consumer baby-food company targeting millennial parents, raised $44 million in a venture-capital funding round.<br />The so-called Series-B financing round values the company at roughly $200 million, people familiar with the matter said. It was led by Valor Equity Partners.<br />Little Spoon ships organic purées, toddler meals and vitamins to customers, bypassing grocery stores and other distribution outlets. Last year, Little Spoon launched Plates, its meals for toddlers and bigger children. The company also offers a virtual community that provides caregivers with a platform to connect and interact.<br />“Packaged baby food hasn’t evolved in line with the modern parent,” Chief Executive Ben Lewis said in an interview. “It was this glaring void that we couldn’t ignore,” added Mr. Lewis, who co-founded Little Spoon in 2017 with Lisa Barnett, Michelle Muller and Angela Vranich.<br />Little Spoon is one of several upstart baby-food companies to jump aboard the organic trend, aiming to attract the growing demographic of millennial parents. Recent reports of high levels of toxic metals in several top baby-food brands opened the door for new competitors focused on safety."
