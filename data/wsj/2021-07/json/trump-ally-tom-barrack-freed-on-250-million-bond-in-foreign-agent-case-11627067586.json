    "body": "Tom Barrack, the real-estate investor and longtime ally of former President Donald Trump, was freed from detention Friday on $250 million bond after striking a deal with federal prosecutors for his release before trial on charges that he worked as a foreign agent of the United Arab Emirates.<br />Mr. Barrack, who was arrested in Los Angeles Tuesday, was ordered to appear in federal court in Brooklyn on Monday, when he will be arraigned on charges of acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government, conspiracy, obstruction of justice and making false statements during a 2019 interview with federal law-enforcement agents. He hasn’t entered a plea and won’t until he is arraigned in Brooklyn. A spokesperson for Mr. Barrack has said he isn’t guilty of the charges.<br />U.S. Magistrate Judge Patricia Donahue agreed to the 74-year-old Mr. Barrack’s release on several conditions, including a $250 million bond with $5 million in cash deposited and held in the trust account of Paul Hastings LLP, his attorney’s law firm. Mr. Barrack, who didn’t appear in court in Los Angeles Friday, also had to surrender his passport and agree to location monitoring.<br />Mr. Barrack, a private-equity and real-estate pioneer who founded Colony Capital, had a decadeslong business relationship with Mr. Trump that became a political alliance when Mr. Trump ran for president in 2016. Mr. Barrack raised more than $30 million for the campaign and became an informal Middle East adviser to the Trump administration.<br />Prosecutors have accused Mr. Barrack of trying to influence Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign and later his administration on behalf of the U.A.E. In an indictment, prosecutors said Mr. Barrack closely consulted with top Emirati government officials before appearing on television, writing opinion articles and speaking to Trump administration officials, using as an intermediary an Emirati businessman Rashid Al-Malik, who was also charged."
