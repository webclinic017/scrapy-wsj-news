    "body": "U.K. home prices are surging as the country’s economy reopens from the pandemic, and U.S. investors are getting in on the action by snapping up home-building companies at bargain prices.<br />Home sales prices last month were 13.4% higher than they were in June 2020, according to the House Price Index published by the Nationwide Building Society, one of Britain’s biggest mortgage lenders. This is the strongest annual growth seen since 2004 and has raised average prices to almost £250,000, equivalent to about $344,200, the Society said.<br />“The real-estate market just goes on growing and growing,” said Raul Cimesa, head of London new homes at real-estate agent Knight Frank.<br />Despite this rise in prices, many home builders have seen some value wiped off their share prices during the pandemic partly because real-estate agents and many construction sites were forced to close for about two months during last year’s spring lockdown.<br />U.S. investment firms are taking advantage of this disconnect. They are targeting the home sales market in London’s suburbs and regional towns and cities."
