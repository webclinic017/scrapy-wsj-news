    "body": "WASHINGTON—Mayor Muriel Bowser cited the continuing surge in gun violence and the shift to working from home as challenges facing Washington, D.C., as it emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />“You put your finger on the issue that we’ve seen in American cities, including ours: An increase, an uptick in the use of illegal guns, shootings and homicides, sadly,” she said in an interview at a Wall Street Journal Future of Cities event.<br />The District of Columbia last year had 198 homicides, the most since 2004. Halfway through this year, the city is on pace to match that number, police data show. Ms. Bowser was part of a delegation that met with President Biden earlier in July to discuss efforts to curb gun violence.<br />City residents have been rattled by several recent shootings, including a drive-by shooting in which a 6-year-old was killed, the wounding of two men during the dinner hour at a popular restaurant, and a shooting outside Nationals Park that led to a Major League Baseball game being suspended.<br />Ms. Bowser has proposed more than $214 million over four years to address gun violence, according to her 2022 budget. She said she was increasingly optimistic that the D.C. council would approve $3.4 million to add 100 new slots to the police training academy, in the face of calls to reduce police funding."
