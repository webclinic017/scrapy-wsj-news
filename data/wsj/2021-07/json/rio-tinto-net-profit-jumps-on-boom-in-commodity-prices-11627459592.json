    "body": "SYDNEY— Rio Tinto  PLC reported a record first-half net profit and more than tripled its midyear payout to shareholders, benefiting from a bull run in commodity prices that has stoked inflation expectations around the world.<br />On Wednesday, the world’s second-largest mining company by market value said net profit for the six months through June rose to more than $12.3 billion from over $3.3 billion a year earlier.<br />First-half underlying earnings, which exclude some one-time items, more than doubled to nearly $12.2 billion, beating the more than $12 billion consensus estimate compiled by Vuma from 14 analyst forecasts.<br />“Government stimulus in response to ongoing Covid-19 pressures has driven strong demand for our products at a time of constrained supply resulting in a significant spike in most prices,” said Chief Executive Jakob Stausholm.<br />The profit boom meant big returns for shareholders. Directors declared an ordinary dividend of $3.76 a share, up from $1.55 a share a year earlier. They also unveiled a special dividend of $1.85 a share."
