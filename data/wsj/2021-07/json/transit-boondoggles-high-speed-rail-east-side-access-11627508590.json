    "body": "Union pocket-lining constitutes only a sub rosa aspect of transit review and construction (“Mass Spending for Mass Transit,” Review & Outlook, July 27). I was part of the early California high-speed-rail planning, and almost from the start, I thought: This will never get built, no matter how much money is thrown at it. Trains barreling through existing rail stations at more than 100 mph? Please. Construction time would make Boston’s Big Dig timeline seem like a weekend getaway.<br />New York’s comparatively simpler East Side Access project is proof of concept for decadeslong planning and construction. I had hoped to attend a ribbon-cutting for that project, after designing it for nearly my entire professional career, but I retired first. Now I hope simply to be alive when the first Long Island Rail Road train comes into that Manhattan station.<br />Steven P. Scalici<br />Staten Island, N.Y."
