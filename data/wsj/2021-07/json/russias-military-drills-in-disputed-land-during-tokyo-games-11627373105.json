    "body": "TOKYO—Russia’s military doesn’t stand down for the Olympics.<br />On Tuesday, Moscow was set to begin military exercises on an island near Japan that it seized in 1945 and Tokyo still claims. A day earlier, Russia’s prime minister visited islands in the same disputed group.<br />“We can’t accept Russia’s moves to strengthen its military in the Northern Territories,” government spokesman Katsunobu Kato said, using Japan’s name for the islands.<br />The uptick in tension over a long-running territorial dispute comes as Russia’s athletes compete in the Tokyo Olympics under the name Russian Olympic Committee, part of the punishment for a state-sponsored doping program. The Russian athletes aren’t allowed to use the national flag or anthem.<br />Russian media had been critical about the Olympics because of the restrictions, but the country’s athletes have had some high-profile successes, including winning the men’s team gymnastics gold medal."
