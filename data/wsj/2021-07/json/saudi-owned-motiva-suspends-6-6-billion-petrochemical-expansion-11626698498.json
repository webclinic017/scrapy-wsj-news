    "body": "Saudi-owned Motiva Enterprises LLC suspended a $6.6 billion plan to add petrochemical facilities to its refining operations in Port Arthur, Texas, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The decision to halt the project—which had envisioned the creation of the biggest refining and petrochemical operation in the U.S.—comes as Aramco dials back its diversification plans and refocuses on its core business of pumping oil and natural gas, according to the people.<br />The Wall Street Journal previously reported that Aramco had slowed the petrochemical project amid a review last year of investments at home and abroad. The review followed financial pressure from lower oil prices and a heavy dividend burden that Aramco took on when it went public in 2019.<br />The plans could still change and the project could get the green light eventually. But the suspension won’t be revisited for at least a year, the people said.<br />The state-run company now plans to invest almost all of its $35 billion capital expenditure budget this year toward boosting oil and natural-gas production, according to people familiar with those plans. Aramco said last year it was working to increase its oil production capacity by one million barrels a day to 13 million barrels a day."
