    "body": "Jeff Bezos’ plans for space go far beyond the short trip he is slated to take there Tuesday.<br />The  Amazon.com Inc.  founder has poured billions into his Blue Origin LLC space venture over more than two decades, believing humanity must ultimately establish outposts across the solar system.<br />More immediately, Mr. Bezos’ company is seeking business in a space market that will triple in size to more than $1 trillion in annual sales by 2040, Morgan Stanley says, assuming rapid technological developments enable routine moon landings, asteroid mining and space tourism.<br />His own giant leap comes July 20, when Blue Origin is scheduled to launch Mr. Bezos and three other people to the edge of space in an 11-minute flight, the first launch with passengers on the company’s New Shepard rocket.<br />A successful trip could provide traction in an emerging space-tourism market, which includes Richard Branson’s  Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc.  Blue Origin’s broader challenge is winning the kind of large, government contracts that provide a steady revenue stream and lend credibility to companies that secure them. Space Exploration Technologies Corp., the formal name for Elon Musk’s SpaceX, has jumped ahead of Blue Origin in winning those deals."
