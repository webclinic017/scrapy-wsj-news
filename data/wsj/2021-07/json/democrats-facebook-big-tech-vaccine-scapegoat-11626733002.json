    "body": "When a bully gets what it wants, it comes back for more.  Facebook  has spent the last year acquiescing to increasingly aggressive liberal demands to suppress content. So it’s no surprise that Democrats have decided they can also get away with making CEO Mark Zuckerberg a scapegoat for plateauing rates of vaccination in the U.S.<br />Last week the White House launched a pointed offensive against Big Tech firms for allegedly not controlling enough vaccine-related speech by users. Press Secretary Jen Psaki criticized the companies from her daily podium, and the Surgeon General pressed them in a report. President Biden declared over the weekend that Facebook is “killing people,” though he walked back that “killing” point on Monday.<br />Sen. Amy Klobuchar snarled that social-media firms should “take this crap off of their platforms that are basically telling people, ‘oh, hey, there’s problems [with the vaccine]’ when we know science proves there isn’t.” The messages are clearly coordinated.<br />Vaccine hesitancy is slowing America’s recovery from the pandemic. Yet Facebook released a rare rebuttal to its progressive tormentors, noting that “vaccine acceptance on the part of Facebook users in the US has increased by 10-15 percentage points” to 85%. It also says the U.K. and Canada “have similar rates of Facebook usage to the US,” yet “those countries have achieved more than 70% vaccination of eligible populations,” Mr. Biden’s July 4 goal.<br />Democrats are paying for having promoted vaccine skepticism in the presidential campaign last year. Then-candidate Biden warned that a rapid approval timeline could be politicized, a point echoed by some who resist the vaccine today, and Vice President Kamala Harris publicly doubted a Trump-approved vaccine. It’s no surprise that this skepticism is now playing out among some Americans when the same politicians say vaccines are safe when they’re in power."
