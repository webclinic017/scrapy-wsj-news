    "body": "TO PORTRAY A SOCCER coach who knows almost zilch about soccer on “Ted Lasso,” Jason Sudeikis still has to know a little something about the game himself. During the pandemic, part of his continuing education has been playing the videogame FIFA 21 Pro Clubs with the show’s cast and crew.<br />“As you start to play, even from that top-down view, you start to appreciate the tactics,” he said. “Then, when I’d go watch matches…I’d see the game a little differently.”<br />In the critically acclaimed Apple TV+ hit, returning for a second season on July 23, the “Saturday Night Live” alumnus stars as a small-time American football coach who is hired to coach a professional European “football” (i.e., soccer) team in England. Last week, the show scored 20 Emmy nominations—the most ever for a rookie comedy series—including one for Mr. Sudeikis’s scriptwriting. Still, he’s in no hurry to master the game: “As long as I…continue to ask questions, we’re always creating content.”<br />Here, the 45-year-old talks about the tools, tech and toys he uses on and off the pitch.<br />"
