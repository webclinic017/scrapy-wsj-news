    "body": "The race is on at  Intel Corp.  as the semiconductor giant pledges to return to the top of its game, committing to produce the world’s best chips within four years.<br />To get there, Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger laid out a plan Monday for the company to introduce at least a new central processing unit—the brains of the modern computer—every year between 2021 and 2025. Each is expected to be based on transistor technology more advanced than the last.<br />Intel was long the unquestioned leader in computing performance. Co-founder Gordon Moore defined the law underpinning the semiconductor industry, describing how engineers would find ways to shrink circuits at a predictable pace year after year. But the company has fallen behind Asian rivals after a series of missteps and delays.<br />Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  and South Korea’s  Samsung Electronics Co.  are now both ahead of Intel in chip-manufacturing technology. They manufacture chips on contract for chip-design specialists, allowing those customers to gain an edge on Intel.<br />“We are accelerating our innovation roadmap to ensure we are on a clear path to process performance leadership by 2025,” Mr. Gelsinger said. The CEO rejoined Intel in February with a mandate to revitalize the company after previously serving as its chief technology officer."
