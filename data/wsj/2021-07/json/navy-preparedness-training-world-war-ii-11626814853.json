    "body": "Regarding Kate Bachelder Odell’s “If War Comes, Will the U.S. Navy Be Prepared?” (op-ed, July 12): My late father-in-law, Russel Lavallee, was serving aboard the aircraft carrier Lexington on Dec. 7, 1941. “We were expecting trouble in the Pacific, but we were only ready for inspection,” he observed. Apparently, not much has changed.<br />After the Lexington was sunk, he was transferred to the carrier Enterprise in time for our miraculous victory at Midway. Here too, however, sailors and airmen paid the price for our lack of preparedness. The Navy’s slow, obsolete Devastator torpedo planes had malfunctioning torpedoes. “We got only a couple of our torpedo planes back,” he said. “They didn’t even get a hit. It was suicide.”<br />After the Battle of Santa Cruz, the situation was dire. Then, the “most beautiful sight in the world”: The American people had built “an entire new fleet of big, beautiful Essex-class carriers,” which steamed to the rescue. Ordinary sailors and airmen in the unprepared Navy had bought with their blood time for the American people to face the reality of war. Given that we have offshored much of our manufacturing capability, could our Navy face war with a major power today?<br />Art DeJong<br />Sheboygan, Wis."
