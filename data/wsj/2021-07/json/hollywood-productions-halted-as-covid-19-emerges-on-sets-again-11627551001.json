    "body": "Production of movies and TV shows is getting disrupted again because of Covid-19 and uncertainty over vaccination protocols, a setback as networks and streaming services remain hungry for fresh content.<br />Among shows that recently suspended shooting as members of the production tested positive for Covid-19 is “House of the Dragon,” the much-anticipated prequel to HBO’s smash hit “Game of Thrones.” Hulu’s comedy “Woke” also had to stop filming because of positive Covid-19 cases.<br />Both shows have resumed production.<br />Movie projects that have been suspended include “God Is a Bullet,” starring Jamie Foxx and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. The production, which is filming in Mexico, shut down this week after actors who had been vaccinated tested positive for Covid-19. Recently production on Tom Cruise’s “Mission: Impossible 7” film shut down briefly because of positive tests.<br />The challenges facing Hollywood echo those seen throughout corporate America as a surge due in large part to the highly infectious Delta variant and current vaccination rates raise questions about the ideal timetable and practices for returns to workplaces."
