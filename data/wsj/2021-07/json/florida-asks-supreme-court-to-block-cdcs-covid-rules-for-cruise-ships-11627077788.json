    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Florida attorney general asked the Supreme Court Friday for an emergency order blocking federal Covid-19 regulations for cruise ships, arguing in the state’s latest challenge that the damage to the tourism industry outweighs their public-health benefits.<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a conditional-sailing order in October establishing a framework for cruise lines to resume operations in phases after a blanket shutdown in March 2020 to slow the spread of Covid-19. Among other provisions, the order allows ships to conduct “simulated voyages” with volunteer passengers to demonstrate to health officials that they have adequate measures in place to mitigate risk of transmitting the disease. Those include social-distancing practices and adequate space to quarantine passengers who test positive for the coronavirus.<br />“Florida acknowledges that cruising will never be a zero-risk activity, as does the CDC,” wrote state Attorney General Ashley Moody, a Republican, who on Twitter disclosed that she has tested positive Covid-19 on Wednesday despite being vaccinated. “But the pandemic began 16 months ago. Society is reopening. Industries have learned to mitigate Covid-19 by voluntarily altering their business practices, and cruise lines should be given that same opportunity,” she told the court.<br />Florida sued in April to invalidate the regulations, arguing they exceeded the CDC’s legal authority and were too burdensome for the cruise industry. A federal district judge in Tampa, Fla., agreed with the state, but last Sunday the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Atlanta, ordered the regulations to remain in place while the litigation proceeds. Florida’s Friday filing asks the Supreme Court to temporarily block the conditional sailing order as the case is litigated.<br />The CDC regulations allow ships to begin operations without first conducting test cruises if they attest that 95% of crew members and passengers are fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Florida said family-oriented cruises would be unable to meet this requirement, as vaccines haven’t been approved for children under age 12. Moreover, Florida has enacted legislation barring businesses from requiring “vaccine passports,” or proof of vaccination."
