    "body": "Worries about the spread of Covid-19 variants drove U.S. government bond yields to their lowest levels in months on Monday, the latest drag on investors’ expectations for economic growth and inflation.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note posted its biggest one-day decline since March, sliding to 1.181% from 1.300% at Friday’s close, according to Tradeweb. That is the lowest close since Feb. 11. Yields fall when bond prices rise.<br />The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of 16 foreign currencies, climbed 0.3% to its highest level since March.<br />“This feels like a risk-off move on virus concerns. It takes some of the shine off growth over the next couple of quarters,” said Chris Jeffery, head of rates and inflation strategy at Legal & General Investment Management.<br />The spread of Covid-19 variants is prompting concerns about widespread tightening of restrictions on movement and commerce, investors said. On Monday, the Australian government extended a lockdown in Melbourne and tightened rules for Sydney over the weekend. Infection cases have also recently reached new highs in Indonesia and Vietnam, according to data from Johns Hopkins University."
