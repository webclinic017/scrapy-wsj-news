    "body": "The Milwaukee Bucks were on the clock with the 15th pick in the 2013 NBA draft when they took a risk on a skinny teenager from the second division of Greek basketball with a name that most Americans didn’t know how to pronounce: Giannis Antetokounmpo.<br />It turned out to be one of the most profitable investments in the history of professional sports.<br />Antetokounmpo turned into the best player on the Bucks. Then he blossomed into the league’s Most Valuable Player two years in a row. Now he’s an NBA champion.<br />The Milwaukee Bucks beat the Phoenix Suns in Game 6 of the NBA Finals on Tuesday night, 105-98, to win their first title since they had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar a half-century ago and complete Giannis Antetokounmpo’s extraordinary ascent from selling trinkets on the streets of Athens to the summit of basketball.<br />His first trip to the Finals was majestic, including two all-time great plays that very few people on the planet could have replicated—a block that nearly broke physics and an alley-oop dunk that did break the Suns. He averaged 35 points and chastened everyone who attempted to stop him. He even managed to make a thrilling spectacle out of shooting free throws."
