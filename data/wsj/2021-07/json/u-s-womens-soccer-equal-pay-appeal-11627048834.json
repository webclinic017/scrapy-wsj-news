    "body": "Members of the U.S. women’s soccer team on Friday appealed a federal judge’s dismissal of the equal-pay portion of their gender-discrimination lawsuit against the U.S. Soccer Federation, arguing that the ruling was legally wrong and calling for the case to be sent to trial.<br />The 79-page appeal, filed with the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, argued that Judge R. Gary Klausner should have focused on the comparative rates of pay between the U.S. women’s and men’s soccer teams rather than on their total compensation. The women’s higher winning percentage should have been considered, the appeal said.<br />“In effect, the court held that pay is equal if a woman can obtain the same amount of money as a man by working more and performing better,” the appeal said. “That is not the law.”<br />In a statement, U.S. Soccer said the ruling rejecting the women’s pay-discrimination claim was correct.<br />“Moving ahead, we will continue to seek a resolution to this matter outside of court so we can chart a positive path forward with the players to grow the game both here at home and around the world,” the statement concluded."
