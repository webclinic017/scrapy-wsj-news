    "body": "The maker of Sun Bum products said Friday it is investigating the safety of one of its sun-care gels after a potentially cancer-causing chemical was found in some batches.<br />Sun Bum Cool Down gel was among the products, along with Neutrogena and Aveeno spray sunscreens, that were identified by Valisure LLC, an online pharmacy, as having samples with high concentrations of benzene. The chemical isn’t an ingredient in sunscreens or cosmetics.<br />A spokesman for S.C. Johnson & Son Inc., the consumer-goods conglomerate that owns Sun Bum, said it has been examining the Sun Bum gel since May when Valisure disclosed its test results and petitioned U.S. regulators to remove the products.<br />“Until we have concrete facts, we don’t want to announce we are recalling the product,” the S.C. Johnson spokesman said. “We are examining the best path forward.”<br />Johnson & Johnson  and  CVS Health Corp.  said this week they would stop selling sun-care products that were named by Valisure as having batches with similarly high concentrations of benzene."
