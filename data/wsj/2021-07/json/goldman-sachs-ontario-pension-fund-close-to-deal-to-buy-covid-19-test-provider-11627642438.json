    "body": "Goldman Sachs  Group Inc.’s infrastructure arm and Canadian pension fund Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System are part of a group that is nearing a deal to buy a majority stake in Germany’s Amedes Holding GmbH, a provider of medical diagnostic services including Covid-19 tests, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The deal would value the business at close to $1.9 billion, including debt, the people familiar with the matter said. Goldman and OMERS along with  AXA Investment  Managers, the asset management business of global insurer AXA SA management are buying the controlling stake from European buyout firm Antin Infrastructure Partners.<br />Based in Hamburg, Germany, privately held Amedes offers diagnostic services for patients, resident doctors and clinics at over 70 laboratory and practice locations in Germany and Belgium, according to its website. Its business handles PCR tests that are used to diagnose Covid-19.<br />The acquisition would allow the buyers to take advantage of strong demand for PCR diagnostic services. However, that business could be at risk of slowing if the rollout of vaccines impedes the virus’s spread.<br />Write to Ben Dummett at ben.dummett@wsj.com"
