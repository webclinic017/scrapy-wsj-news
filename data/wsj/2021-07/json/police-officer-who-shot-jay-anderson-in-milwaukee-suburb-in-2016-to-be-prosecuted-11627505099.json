Mr. Mensah, who is also Black, stopped to question him and shot him through the passenger window, firing at least six times.<br />Police say Mr. Anderson lunged for a gun on the passenger seat. Available dashcam evidence was inconclusive.<br />Mr. Andersonâ€™s family deny he lunged for a gun, and question whether a weapon was on the passenger seat in the first place. They say police tampered with the crime scene before the investigation. Mr. Anderson had a one-year-old baby at the time with his girlfriend."
