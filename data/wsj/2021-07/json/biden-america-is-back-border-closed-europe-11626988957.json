    "body": "The Biden administration’s aim to restore American global leadership is being undermined by its continuing entry ban for non-American travelers from Europe, a complaint raised by German Chancellor Angela Merkel during her recent visit to the White House. (“Biden Welcomes Merkel for Her Final Visit as Germany’s Chancellor,” World News, July 16.)<br />President Biden has the valiant objective of strengthening the world’s democracies against the rising autocracies. But there is no substitute for human-to-human interaction in spreading American optimism for freedom around the world. Visiting America always inspires me, as it has inspired countless millions. Europe has opened to the U.S., with many Americans enjoying European summer vacations in recent weeks. There is no reason the U.S. cannot reciprocate and open to Europe, especially to those fully vaccinated. It should also find ways to deploy its arsenal of testing to open safely to those nations with less-advanced vaccination programs.<br />As a lifelong proponent of U.S. leadership, I am delighted to hear that “America is back.” The free world missed you. But America cannot spread democratic values around the world if it continues to be closed even to its closest friends.<br />Anders Fogh Rasmussen<br />Chairman, Alliance of Democracies Foundation"
