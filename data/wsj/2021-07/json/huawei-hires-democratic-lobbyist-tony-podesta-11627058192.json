    "body": "Huawei Technologies Co. has hired veteran Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta—whose firm imploded in 2017 amid financial and legal troubles—as part of the Chinese company’s expanded U.S. influence operation, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Mr. Podesta’s work for Huawei is still in the early stages, and the full scope of his advocacy for the company is still being determined, according to one of these people.<br />Mr. Podesta’s resurfacing in the lobbying world comes as Democrats once again control both chambers of Congress and the White House. He has long relationships with President Biden and some top White House aides, including senior counselor Steve Ricchetti. His brother, John Podesta, is chairman of the liberal Center for American Progress and is close with the administration.<br />Mr. Podesta is the latest in a string of Washington advisers recently hired by Huawei.<br />The Shenzhen, China-based company—the world’s largest maker of telecommunications equipment—faced relentless attack by the Trump administration, which moved to block the company’s advance in the U.S. and globally on grounds that the company’s equipment could be an espionage threat."
