    "body": "The former chief executive of CBS is looking to get in on the media industry’s merger frenzy.<br />Joe Ianniello, who led  CBS Corp.  when it merged with Viacom Inc. in 2019, is launching a special-purpose acquisition company that hopes to raise at least $300 million and pursue a merger.<br />In an interview, Mr. Ianniello said media is a target-rich industry, as large companies look to spin off assets that aren’t their core focus. He pointed to ViacomCBS’s decision to sell CNET to Red Ventures LLC in 2020 and  AT&T Inc.’s  move earlier this year to spin out its DirecTV business.<br />“All of these companies grew a lot through M&A, and they’re diversified,” Mr. Ianniello said. “A lot of these companies are going to shed assets for them to focus.” Other potential acquisition targets could be in the telecommunications or technology sectors, Mr. Ianniello said.<br />Mr. Ianniello has named his firm Argus, a reference to the many-eyed giant of Greek mythology and to Mr. Ianniello’s two-decade career at CBS, known for its iconic eye-shaped logo. A spokesman for the firm declined to say how much money has been raised."
