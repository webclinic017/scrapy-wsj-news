    "body": "Instead of blaming  Facebook  CEO Mark Zuckerberg for “plateauing rates of vaccination in the U.S.” (“Facebook Is Biden’s Vaccine Scapegoat,” Review & Outlook, July 20), President Biden should be urging the Food and Drug Administration to make a prompt decision on full approval for the Covid vaccines in use. To date these vaccines have received only emergency provisional approval.<br />For full approval, the  Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine was given a decision date of January 2022. Yet more than 200 million doses of this vaccine have been administered in the U.S., and it has been found effective against the Covid virus, including the Delta variant, with relatively few serious adverse effects. The Delta variant is spreading rapidly in areas of the U.S. with low vaccination rates, and waiting another six months for full FDA approval is simply unacceptable.<br />Full approval of a clearly effective vaccine would make it easier for people on the fence to opt for vaccination. It would also allow more universities and businesses to mandate vaccination for their students and employees.<br />Howard J. Zeft, M.D.<br />Milwaukee"
