    "body": "Anthony Danielswriting in the June issue of the New Criterion:<br /><br />The problem with self-esteem is that it is entirely egotistical and self-regarding, unlike self-respect, which is a social virtue and imposes discipline and obligations upon the person who has, or wishes to have, it. By contrast, self-esteem is like a medal that one pins to one’s own chest merely by virtue of existing. I am, therefore I esteem myself, and I demand that you esteem me too. Curiously enough, at the height of self-esteem’s popularity most people knew, or at least had some inkling, that the whole idea was completely bogus. Sometimes when patients would say to me, “I have low self-esteem, doctor,” I would reply (admittedly not in every last case), “Well, at least you’ve got one thing right, then.” Far from becoming angry, they started to laugh, as if they had been caught out in a naughty game that they had been playing. . . .<br />We hardly need the so-called science of psychology to tell us that we don’t want people to be like cabbage leaves squashed under the wheels of an ox-cart, or conversely to be preening, self-satisfied popinjays. The fact is that once you start thinking about whether you esteem yourself too little, you are lost."
