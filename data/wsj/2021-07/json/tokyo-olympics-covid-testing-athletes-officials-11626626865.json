    "body": "The long-feared possibility that the Covid-19 pandemic could disrupt the Tokyo Olympics is rapidly emerging as a reality, as Games organizers scramble to deal with a rising load of athletes and officials who are testing positive upon arrival in Japan.<br />The stream of positive cases is quickly demonstrating how difficult it will be to stage one of the world’s largest events during a global pandemic. Tens of thousands of participants from more than 200 countries are entering a country where the vaccination rate of the local population remains low and the more-contagious Delta variant is spreading.<br />Officials have a dilemma that will run throughout the Games. The Japanese public is deeply wary of the Olympics, fearing an outbreak that will spill into the general population. So they are deploying strict rules to limit the risk—which could block athletes from participating if they become ensnared in Covid protocols.<br />South Africa’s soccer governing body said Sunday two of its men’s team members based in the Olympic Village and a technical staff member had tested positive and were being isolated. Also testing positive after arrival was International Olympic Committee member Ryu Seung-min from South Korea, Games organizers said.<br />And on Sunday, the British Olympic Association confirmed that six athletes and two staff members from its track and field team were identified as close contacts of an individual—not from the Team GB delegation—who tested positive following their arrival in Tokyo on Friday. The British delegation members have continued to test negative and are in self-isolation in their rooms at the team’s camp."
