    "body": "At least 41 states have made changes to their election laws already this year following the contentious 2020 election.<br />Republicans this year have sponsored at least 114 new state laws that make changes to elections, including new restrictions on mail ballots following a sharp increase in voting by mail during the pandemic-era election, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis conducted after many state legislatures have wrapped up their sessions.<br />The list of GOP-controlled states that have made changes includes Georgia and Arizona, both states where President Biden won by narrow margins and where tensions remain high as former President Donald Trump continues to advance unsupported fraud claims to explain his loss in 2020.<br />Democrats, who control fewer state houses, have sponsored at least 86 new laws that mostly expand access to ballots, such as extending voting by mail in California and Nevada and expanding ballot drop-off boxes in Virginia and Illinois, the Journal’s analysis shows.<br />The flurry of new laws at the state level comes as Democrats’ effort to pass federal-level voting legislation has stalled due to Republican opposition in the Senate. Taken together, the changes mean that tens of millions of voters around the country will have to navigate new rules to cast their ballots in next year’s midterm elections."
