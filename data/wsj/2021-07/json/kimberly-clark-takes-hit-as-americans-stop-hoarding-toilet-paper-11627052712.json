    "body": "The maker of Huggies diapers and Cottonelle toilet paper said it expects to charge higher prices through 2022 in an effort to offset rising costs.<br />Kimberly-Clark Corp.  on Friday reported its second-straight quarterly sales decline as well-stocked Americans bought less toilet paper and paper towels in a largely reopened economy.<br />Organic sales, a measure that strips out currency effects and deals, fell again, down 3%. Rising materials costs sliced profit and margins for the second quarter. Earnings fell more than 40%, worse than Wall Street anticipated.<br />Americans are cutting back on pandemic staples, from paper towels to cleaning wipes, just as product makers face soaring costs.<br />“Clearly our results did not turn out as expected,” Kimberly-Clark Chief Executive Mike Hsu said Friday in a call with analysts."
