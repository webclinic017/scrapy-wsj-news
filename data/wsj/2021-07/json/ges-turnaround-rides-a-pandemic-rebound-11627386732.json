    "body": "General Electric Co.  reported higher orders for its industrial machinery and raised its goal for cash flows this year, as the manufacturer continues to recover from pandemic-induced shocks to the global economy.<br />GE said its second-quarter revenue rose 9% to $18.3 billion from the year-ago period, when airlines grounded planes and canceled jet purchases as Covid-19-related lockdowns took hold.<br />The company reported another quarterly net loss on Tuesday, but said it had an adjusted profit that topped Wall Street’s expectations excluding one-time charges.<br />The company said it expects to generate free cash flow from its industrial operations between $3.5 billion and $5 billion for the full year, excluding discontinued operations and finance charges. On that basis, it had previously projected $2.5 billion to $4.5 billion in cash flow. GE left its 2021 earnings and revenue targets unchanged.<br />GE has been slashing costs in its aviation unit and streamlining its power business, while shrinking its debt load through asset sales including a deal to shed most of its Gecas jet leasing business earlier this year. That deal is expected to bring in $24 billion in cash and close by year-end."
