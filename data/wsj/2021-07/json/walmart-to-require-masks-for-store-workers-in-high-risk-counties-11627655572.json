    "body": "Walmart Inc.  and  Walt Disney Co.  are requiring certain workers to get vaccinated for Covid-19 amid a shift in federal health guidelines and rising U.S. cases in recent weeks.<br />Disney said Friday it would require employees in the U.S. to be fully vaccinated to help curb the spread of the virus.<br />The mandate would initially apply to salaried and nonunion hourly employees working at any of its U.S. sites, but the company said it had begun conversations with labor unions. In addition, all new hires would be required to be fully vaccinated before beginning employment, the company said.<br />Those who arenâ€™t vaccinated and are working on-site would have two months to complete the vaccination protocol, the company said, adding that those who are working remotely will need to provide proof of vaccination before returning.<br />Disney had about 170,000 employees world-wide as of April 3, according to a securities filing."
