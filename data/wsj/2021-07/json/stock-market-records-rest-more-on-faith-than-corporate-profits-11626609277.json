    "body": "Look at Wall Street forecasts, and the pandemic increasingly seems like little more than a lost year. Predictions for S&P 500 earnings per share this year are almost back up to where they stood at the start of March 2020, before the reality of Covid-19 put red lines through everyone’s outlook.<br />As the earnings season gets under way, two things stand out: just how much the earnings improvement has mattered this year and just how little disappointing earnings have mattered in the past few years.<br />Start with this year. Operating earnings for 2021 are expected to come in 14% higher than analysts were forecasting at the start of January, and the S&P is up 16%. Higher 2021 profits seem to explain higher stock prices almost perfectly.<br />Yet look back further and the explanation collapses. Earnings are still predicted to be lower this year than they were forecast to be in February 2019, when Refinitiv began collecting the Wall Street average for 2021. If the market moved purely with annual earnings predictions, stocks would be about a 10th lower than they were then, but in fact the S&P is 60% higher.<br />Why do earnings matter this year when investors paid so little attention to them in the past? The answer has three parts."
