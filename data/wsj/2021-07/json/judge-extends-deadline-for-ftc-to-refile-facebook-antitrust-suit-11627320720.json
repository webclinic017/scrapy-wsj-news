    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Federal Trade Commission has until Aug. 19 to file an amended version of its antitrust lawsuit against  Facebook Inc.  after a judge granted the agency an extension.<br />Judge James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia had previously set a July 29 deadline after saying the agency hadn’t supported its claims that Facebook has monopoly power in personal social-networking services. His dismissal of the suit cited in part how the FTC calculated the company’s market share.<br />The FTC asked for the filing extension Friday, saying Facebook didn’t oppose it; and Judge Boasberg approved the request. After the agency files an amended suit, Facebook would have until Oct. 4 to respond. Subsequently, the two sides may be able to file additional counterarguments.<br />Facebook has sought the recusal of FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan from the agency’s deliberations on whether to file a new antitrust case, arguing she couldn’t be impartial because of her long history of criticizing it and other big-tech firms.<br />The FTC has declined to comment on the demand."
