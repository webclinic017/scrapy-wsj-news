    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Biden Says Kabul Is No Saigon” (July 9): Robert Gates, the respected former secretary of defense under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama, wrote in his memoir that Joe Biden had been wrong on “nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades,” including the bin Laden operation. Since the book was published in 2014, make that 47 years and counting.<br />Ronald P. Ramsay<br />Palmetto, Fla.<br /><br />Why not leave U.S. troops to defend Kabul and make it a permanent base? We could keep a close eye on insurgents and provide a haven for opponents of the Taliban. It seems we introduced younger Afghans to a Western way of life, then abandoned them. I guess this will teach them not to trust the U.S., a valuable lesson they’ll never forget—to our detriment."
