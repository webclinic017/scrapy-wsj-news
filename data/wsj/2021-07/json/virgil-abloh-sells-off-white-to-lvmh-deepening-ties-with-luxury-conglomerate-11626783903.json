    "body": "PARIS—LVMH Möet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE is taking a 60% stake in Off-White, the brand founded by American designer Virgil Abloh, deepening the French conglomerate’s ties to a leading proponent of hip hop and streetwear in luxury fashion.<br />Mr. Abloh, 40 years old, is already the creative director of menswear for Louis Vuitton, LVMH’s core brand and the world’s top-selling luxury fashion label. In addition to taking the stake in Off-White, LVMH said it and Mr. Abloh would collaborate on other products beyond luxury fashion.<br />The partnership comes as the luxury industry embraces prominent Black artists, designers and hip-hop stars, seeking the cultural clout that can draw younger shoppers to their brands. Mr. Abloh is perhaps the most prominent Black executive in luxury fashion.<br />He is one of the few Black creative directors of a major European fashion house, alongside Olivier Rousteing at Balmain. That comes in addition to his work as a DJ, industrial designer and visual artist, including exhibitions at London’s Tate Modern and the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.<br />Under the deal announced Tuesday, LVMH will take a 60% in the Off-White trademark, with Mr. Abloh keeping the other 40%. Financial terms weren’t disclosed."
