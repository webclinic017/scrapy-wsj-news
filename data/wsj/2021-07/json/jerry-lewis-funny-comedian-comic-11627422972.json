    "body": "In “The Martin and Lewis Decade” (op-ed, July 26), Tevi Troy characterizes Jerry Lewis as “a rubber-faced, hyperkinetic Jewish comedian who seemed as if he couldn’t stand still for a moment.” But an old adage teaches that comedians are different from comics: Comedians say funny things, while comics say things funny.
