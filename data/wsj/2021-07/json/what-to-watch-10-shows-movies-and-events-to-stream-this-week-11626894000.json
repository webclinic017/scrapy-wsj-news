    "body": "Are we entering an era of the nice-guy comedy? The second season of “Ted Lasso” arrives on  Apple  TV+ Friday, and already fans are clamoring for the comedy series about an American football coach hired to coach soccer in the U.K. The series has grown so popular that even real coaches want to be more like Jason Sudeikis’s Ted Lasso, a guy who doesn’t know much about the sport but has a talent for getting the best out of his players.<br />The series picked up 20 Emmy nominations last week, a record for a comedy in its first season. Its success so far also follows last year’s comedy favorite, “Schitt’s Creek,” another sitcom known for its earnestness, that swept all of the comedy categories at last year’s award ceremony.<br />Here’s what else is streaming this week, including the Olympics:<br />(Peacock, NBC Sports)<br />NBC Universal’s Peacock streaming service was counting on the 2020 Summer Olympics as marquee content for its launch last summer. With the games delayed to this year, Peacock is streaming some of the Olympics’ high-profile events, and is sending Amber Ruffin, one of its new late-night stars, to contribute to the coverage."
