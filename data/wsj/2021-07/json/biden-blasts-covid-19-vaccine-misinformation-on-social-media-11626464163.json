    "body": "President Biden blasted  Facebook  and other social-media companies over the spread of misinformation around Covid-19 vaccines on their platforms.<br />“They’re killing people,” Mr. Biden said Friday afternoon in response to a question about his message to companies like Facebook about misinformation. “The only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated. And they’re killing people.”<br />The Biden administration this week has raised concerns about misinformation, with the pace of vaccinations down in the U.S. and the highly transmissible Delta variant spreading. Experts say the vaccines are highly effective against Covid-19. U.S. health regulators have warned that the  Johnson & Johnson  vaccine is linked to a very small incidence of cases of a rare neurological disorder associated with other shots.<br />Misinformation being circulated on Facebook Inc. makes various claims, including that the vaccine can lead to infertility, according to the White House. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is no evidence that the Covid-19 vaccines cause female or male fertility problems.<br />Facebook spokesman Kevin McAlister said that Mr. Biden’s claim wasn’t supported by facts and that more than 3.3 million Americans have used a Facebook tool to find out where to get a vaccine. “The facts show that Facebook is helping save lives. Period,” he said."
