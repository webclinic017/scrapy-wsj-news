    "body": "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti—Five senior officers of the country’s National Police have been detained in connection with the assassination last week of President Jovenel Moïse, Haiti’s National Police chief Leon Charles said Friday.<br />One of those detained is Dimitri Hérard, who had been the head of Mr. Moïse’s security detail. Mr. Charles said that the five officers haven’t been charged, but that Mr. Hérard had been interrogated.<br />More than 20 members of Mr. Moïse’s security detail are also being interrogated, he added. Some of them were on duty at the president’s home on the night of the murder, but Mr. Charles wouldn’t specify how many. Police said they want to find out why the guards didn’t appear to have put up resistance to the killers at the president’s home on a cul-de-sac.<br />“Our colleagues from the FBI and the Colombian delegation were able to ask some questions to some of the bad guys that we got, who we know completed the assassination,” Mr. Charles said at a press conference.<br />Haitian authorities have said that more than 20 former Colombian soldiers were connected to the killing on July 7, prompting Colombian President Ivan Duque’s administration to send a small delegation to Haiti while providing Haitian investigators with evidence gathered in Colombia."
