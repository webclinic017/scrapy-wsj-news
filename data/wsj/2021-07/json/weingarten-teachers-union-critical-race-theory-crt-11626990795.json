    "body": "In “Teachers Union Responds on Woke Education” (Letters, July 16), American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten justifies teaching critical race theory in our schools by citing examples of historical racism allegedly being glossed over or omitted. But most Americans support teaching students about slavery, racism and their devastating effects.<br />Ms. Weingarten’s rationale intentionally deflects focus from critical race theory’s true tenets: America has always been racist and irredeemable; all whites are supremacists and are successful via white privilege; systemic racism pervades American society and institutions; government-imposed equal outcomes are necessary to improve society; capitalism and private property are evil; constitutional freedoms must be subordinated to critical race theory’s goals. The theory also calls for our schools to be the mouthpiece for its indoctrination goals and to encourage students to join leftist activist groups.<br />Adriene Doray<br />Pagosa Springs, Colo.<br />"
