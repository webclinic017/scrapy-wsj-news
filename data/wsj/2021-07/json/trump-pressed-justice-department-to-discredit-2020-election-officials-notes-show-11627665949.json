    "body": "WASHINGTON—Then-President Donald Trump pressed top Justice Department officials in late December to declare the 2020 election corrupt in support of his efforts to overturn President Biden’s victory, notes of the conversation show.<br />Mr. Trump made the demand during a Dec. 27 phone call with then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and his deputy, Richard Donoghue, whose scribbled notes memorializing the conversation were released to Congress and made public Friday.<br />“Just say that the election was corrupt + leave the rest to me and the R. Congressmen,” Mr. Trump said, according to Mr. Donoghue’s notes, after Mr. Rosen told him the Justice Department “can’t + won’t snap its fingers + change the outcome of the election, doesn’t work that way.”<br />At other points in the conversation, Mr. Trump criticized the top two officials, saying “People are angry – blaming DOJ + for inaction” and “DOJ failing to respond to legitimate complaints / report of crimes,” Mr. Donoghue’s notes say.<br />“You guys may not be following the internet the way I do,” Mr. Trump told them, according to the notes released by the House Oversight and Reform Committee, which is examining the Trump administration’s efforts in its final days to undo Mr. Biden’s win."
