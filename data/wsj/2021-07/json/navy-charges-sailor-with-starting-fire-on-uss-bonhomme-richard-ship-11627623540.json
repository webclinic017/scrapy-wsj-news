    "body": "An American sailor was charged with starting the fire that heavily damaged an amphibious assault ship last year and will face a preliminary hearing on the accusations, the U.S. Navy said Thursday.<br />The USS Bonhomme Richard, outfitted to carry and launch the military’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, burned for more than four days last July while docked off San Diego. Navy officials later decided to scrap the ship rather than spend up to $3.2 billion to rebuild it.<br />Navy officials said last August that the fire was being investigated as a possible arson committed by a sailor on board the ship.<br />Navy officials didn’t name the sailor charged on Thursday, but said they were a member of the Bonhomme Richard’s crew at the time of the blaze. The charges were filed under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the judicial system used across the armed services, said Cmdr. Sean Robertson, spokesman for the Navy’s Third Fleet, which oversees the Eastern and Northern Pacific Ocean.<br />Cmdr. Robertson said a criminal investigation uncovered sufficient evidence for filing charges, adding that the preliminary hearing would determine whether there is probable cause for the charges to proceed."
