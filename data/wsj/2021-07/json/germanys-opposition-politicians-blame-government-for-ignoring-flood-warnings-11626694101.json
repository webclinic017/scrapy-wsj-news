    "body": "BERLIN—Some opposition politicians on Monday accused Angela Merkel’s government of failing to heed meteorologists’ warnings ahead of last week’s deadly flood, sparking the first debate about the political responsibility for the high human toll.<br />More than 160 people died and around 1,000 have so far been hospitalized following the disaster that hit the country last Wednesday and Thursday. Officials say those numbers could increase as rescuers keep combing through destroyed homes.<br />International and German meteorologists issued precise flood warnings for the Western part of the country last Monday, yet the disaster took many affected communities by surprise, contributing to the high number of casualties as victims were trapped by the floodwaters in their homes during the night.<br />Politicians from the center-right Free Democrats, the Greens and the Left Party said Ms. Merkel’s government had to act on these warnings, with some calling for Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who oversees disaster management, to resign.<br />“This was a grave systemic failure: We must openly talk about the failures of government and what needs to be immediately improved to prevent this from repeating,” said Michael Theurer, a lawmaker in the Free Democratic Party who focuses on disaster management policy in parliament."
