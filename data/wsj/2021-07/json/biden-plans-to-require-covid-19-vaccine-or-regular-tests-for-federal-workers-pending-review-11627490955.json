    "body": "President Biden is expected to announce Thursday that his administration will require federal employees to get vaccinated or be regularly tested for Covid-19, according to a person familiar with the discussions.<br />The move would represent the latest effort by the administration to address the highly transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus.<br />The person familiar with the situation said no decision has been finalized, and the policy is still under review. The person said the administration is also strongly considering more stringent masking protocols for unvaccinated federal workers. Such policies could affect millions of workers, depending on which categories of employees were included.<br />Mr. Biden said Tuesday that a policy requiring vaccines for federal workers was under consideration. He also said in a statement that he plans to lay out the next steps for getting more Americans vaccinated in a speech on Thursday. CNN first reported the presidentâ€™s expected announcement for federal workers.<br />The administration is ramping up its efforts to fend off the highly contagious Delta variant. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised its mask guidance to recommend vaccinated people in some parts of the country resume wearing them indoors. It also said K-12 schools should adopt universal masking, regardless of vaccination status. Local officials in some areas have begun reimposing mask rules or requiring public workers to get the Covid-19 vaccine, and some companies have issued vaccine mandates."
