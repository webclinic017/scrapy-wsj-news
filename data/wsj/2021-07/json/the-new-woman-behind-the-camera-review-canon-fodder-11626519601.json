    "body": "<br />New York<br />‘The New Woman Behind the Camera” at the Metropolitan Museum of Art covers a lot of ground. More than 120 photographers from more than 20 countries are enlisted to support the thesis that between the 1920s and 1940s female photographers, in unprecedented numbers and on a global scale, opened up new artistic vistas for themselves and for other women.<br />The idea for this gender-centric world-wide history of Modernist photography originated with Andrea Nelson, associate curator in the Department of Photographs at Washington’s National Gallery and editor of the massive catalog. Covid-19 thwarted plans for a Sept. 2020 opening there so it is having its debut here. (The National Gallery will finally host it in October.)<br />Together with Mia Fineman, curator of photographs at the Met, Ms. Nelson has chosen to group the 185 prints, photobooks and related material not by region but around themes, such as “The City,” “Fashion and Advertising,” “The Studio,” “Social Documentary” and “Modern Bodies.”"
