    "body": "Companies are encouraging their workers to get vaccinated as Covid-19 cases climb again. Yet relatively few workplaces are making shots required.<br />On Monday, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs became the first federal agency to require employee vaccinations, and California became the first state to do so for its public workers. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that all municipal employees will be required to be vaccinated by Sept. 13, or get tested weekly, and urged the city’s private employers to push similar measures.<br />President Biden said Tuesday that a vaccine mandate for all federal employees was under consideration.<br />Some companies, including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, have mandated that all workers must get vaccinated or divulge their vaccination status before returning to the office. United Airlines requires Covid-19 vaccines for new employees.<br />Overall, though, Covid-19 vaccine mandates at work remain rare, partly because doing so can be a legal minefield for companies, employment attorneys say. In some cases, mandates have resulted in employee lawsuits and termination of workers. And in a tight labor market, employers also risk losing workers who balk at such requirements."
