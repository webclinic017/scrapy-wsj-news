    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden will meet at the White House with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Aug. 30, the White House said, amid tensions between Washington and Kyiv over a controversial Russian natural-gas pipeline.<br />“The visit will affirm the United States’ unwavering support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Russia’s ongoing aggression in the Donbas and Crimea,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement, adding that the visit will also focus on energy cooperation and Mr. Zelensky’s efforts to crack down on corruption in the country.<br />The White House had previously said Mr. Biden had invited Mr. Zelensky to Washington this summer, but had not specified a date.<br />The announcement of the visit comes as the U.S. and Germany reached an agreement allowing the completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. When completed, the project will bypass an existing pipeline network in Ukraine, a prospect that has concerned many in Kyiv, who see the existing route as a check against Russia.<br />Under the U.S.-Germany agreement, Berlin and Washington agreed to help Ukraine in energy-related projects and diplomacy. The U.S. and Germany will also try to ensure that Ukraine continues to receive roughly $3 billion in annual transit fees that Russia pays under its current agreement with Kyiv, which runs through 2024."
