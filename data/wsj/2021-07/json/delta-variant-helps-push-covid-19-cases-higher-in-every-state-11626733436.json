    "body": "Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations across the U.S. are growing steadily higher as the infectious Delta variant takes hold and the pace of vaccination subsides from highs reached in April.<br />The country has reported an average of 32,287 new coronavirus cases each day over the past week, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Johns Hopkins data, more than double what the seven-day average was 10 days ago. The uptick in cases has touched every state and Washington, D.C., with the seven-day average of newly reported cases exceeding the 14-day average in each place for the past four days, according to the data.<br />Coronavirus-related hospitalizations have also jumped, rising 35.8% between July 7 and July 13 compared with the previous seven days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />Doctors and epidemiologists point to the Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2, as a main cause. The variant, now dominant in the U.S., is estimated to be 40%-80% more infectious than the Alpha variant. First detected in India late last year, Delta played a significant role in a record-setting surge of infections there and has since led to increases in cases around the world. Existing Covid-19 vaccines are effective against the variant, though no vaccine is 100% effective.<br />While the latest U.S. Covid-19 metrics are still far lower than peaks reached early this year, they have raised concern among public-health officials, epidemiologists and investors. U.S. stocks, oil prices and bond yields all fell Monday as anxiety mounted over the spread of the Delta variant and its potential impact on the global economyâ€”similar to trading patterns seen in the earliest days of pandemic."
