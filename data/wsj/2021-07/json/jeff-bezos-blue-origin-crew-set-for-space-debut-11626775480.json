    "body": "VAN HORN, Texas— Amazon . com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos’ scheduled trip to the edge of space Tuesday is expected to last only 11 minutes, but it has been decades in the making.<br />Mr. Bezos and three other passengers are scheduled to launch on Blue Origin LLC’s New Shepard spacecraft at 9 a.m. ET from a company facility in West Texas. The planned flight would be Blue Origin’s inaugural crewed mission and a milestone toward Mr. Bezos’ goal of developing a viable space business.<br />Mr. Bezos has been building toward the launch since 2000, when he founded Blue Origin. The company has hired staffers to develop rockets, engines and spacecraft and now employs more than 3,500 people at facilities in Florida, California and other locations.<br />In the run-up to today’s launch, Mr. Bezos has been promoting Blue Origin’s launch using his personal Instagram account. One video showed him fist-bumping his brother in a blue flight suit; in a photo he posed with his fellow New Shepard passengers in the Texas desert.<br />The flight is timed to coincide with the date in 1969 when the Apollo 11 mission landed on the moon. In speeches, Mr. Bezos has cited that event as a key moment during his life and stated his conviction that humanity must establish outposts in the solar system where people could live."
