    "body": "Former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, once one of the most powerful leaders in the U.S. Catholic Church, has been charged with sexually assaulting a 16-year-old boy in Massachusetts in 1974.<br />Mr. McCarrick, 91 years old, was charged with three counts of indecent assault and battery in a criminal complaint issued in District Court in Dedham, Mass., on Wednesday. He is the first current or former U.S. cardinal to be charged with sex crimes.<br />“We will look forward to addressing this case in the courtroom,” Barry Coburn, a lawyer for Mr. McCarrick, said in a statement.<br />Mr. McCarrick was defrocked in 2019 after he was found guilty of sexual abuse of minors and sexual misconduct with adults in a trial at the Vatican.<br />Under Massachusetts law, the statute of limitations for sex crimes is suspended when the alleged abuser, if not a Massachusetts resident, leaves the state after the alleged abuse, said Mitchell Garabedian, the lawyer for the alleged victim, whose name is redacted from court documents."
