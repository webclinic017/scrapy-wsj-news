    "body": "Lawyers for New York City argued Monday that the city’s decision to end the Trump Organization’s contract to operate a Bronx golf course was lawful because attracting top tournaments wasn’t possible after the Capitol riot.<br />“The Trump name—once a key selling point for his businesses, including [the Bronx course] and other of Trump’s golf course entities—was irretrievably tarnished,” the lawyers wrote in court documents filed Monday evening. Attracting top tournaments was a core provision of the Bronx agreement, they said.<br />The Trump Organization declined to comment.<br />Monday’s filing came in response to a lawsuit the Trump Organization filed in New York state court last month accusing the city of unlawfully ending its contract to operate Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point, a public golf course in the Bronx. The lawsuit argued that Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, was biased against former President Donald Trump for years then used the Capitol riot as a pretext to end the contract.<br />On Jan. 6, shortly after a speech by Mr. Trump, a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, where Congress was meeting to certify President Biden’s election victory."
