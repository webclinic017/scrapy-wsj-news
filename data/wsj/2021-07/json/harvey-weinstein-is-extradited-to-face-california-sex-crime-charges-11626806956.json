    "body": "Harvey Weinstein, the one-time internationally acclaimed Hollywood producer, was extradited to California on Tuesday to face sex-crimes charges, after more than a year of delays because of the Covid-19 pandemic and his health.<br />Mr. Weinstein, who is serving a 23-year sentence for felony sex crimes in New York, had challenged the extradition, arguing that he wouldn’t receive adequate medical care in a West Coast jail. Last month, a New York judge denied his request, paving the way for Tuesday’s transfer.<br />“We will be fighting so that Harvey can receive his needed medical care and of course, so that he can be treated fairly,” a spokesman for Mr. Weinstein said Tuesday. “Due process, presumption of innocence and a fair trial are all still his right.”<br />A lawyer for Mr. Weinstein didn’t respond to a request for comment.<br />The Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office declined to comment."
