    "body": "Activists wasted no time attributing last week’s tragic tornado outbreak in the Midwest to climate change. My hometown in southwest Indiana would like a word.<br />Princeton, Ind., was the final community struck by the terrible 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak—still the nation’s worst—that killed nearly 700 people and injured thousands more across Missouri, Illinois and Indiana. When I was in high school 50 years later, people still talked about this extreme weather outbreak. I had friends whose families lost people. Older folks who remembered the tornado’s ferocity would scan the skies with a special concern as storm season began every spring."
