    "body": "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is meeting this week, and its members were greeted Tuesday with the rude welcome of surging wholesale prices. This is more evidence that Chairman Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve have made a historic mistake that they now have to fix without sending the economy into recession.<br />Prices for final goods increased 9.6% year-on-year in November, up from 8.8% in October. The nearby chart shows how wholesale prices have risen every month but one this year on an annual basis, and across most major goods and services. Producer prices tend to flow into consumer prices, which were up 6.8% year-on-year in November."
