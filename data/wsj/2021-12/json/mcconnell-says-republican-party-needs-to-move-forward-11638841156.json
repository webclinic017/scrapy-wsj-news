    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said it was time for the Republican Party to move on from the 2020 elections, sticking to his strategy of trying to move past the Donald Trump era even as the former president remains a force in next year’s elections.<br />“There always are a lot of voices,” Mr. McConnell said at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit, when asked about Mr. Trump’s role in the midterms. Keeping his focus on recapturing the Senate, which is split 50-50, Mr. McConnell said that if he were advising Senate candidates, “I’d be talking about what this administration is doing and how do you feel about it, because the American people are looking to the future.”"
