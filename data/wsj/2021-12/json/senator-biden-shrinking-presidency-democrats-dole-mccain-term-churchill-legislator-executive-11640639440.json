    "body": "When Politico’s Tim Alberta asked Joe Biden during a December 2019 Democratic debate what the former vice president and longtime Delaware senator would bring to the presidency, Mr. Biden went with his top selling point: experience. Experience, he said, gave him the chops he needed to revive an ailing economy and restore America’s global leadership.<br />“I have more experience in doing that than anybody on this stage,” he declared. When Mr. Alberta followed up by noting that he’d be 82 at the end of his first term—“the oldest president in American history”—Mr. Biden was ready for that too."
