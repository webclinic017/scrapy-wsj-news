    "body": "In today’s real-estate market, nothing should surprise you, but here’s an interesting one: As it exits iBuying after steep losses,  Zillow Group  is now worth nearly twice as much as it was before going big into the once-hyped business.<br />The fact that the online real-estate giant’s shares have plunged 25% since the company on Nov. 2 said it would wind down its automated home-flipping business might be lulling shareholders into a false sense of security that its value reflects the retreat. Yet its appreciation since announcing a push into iBuying in February 2019 hasn’t merely tracked a hot stock market: Over that period, the S&P 500 is up just 69%."
