    "body": "Mark Zuckerberg would like you to be a little more present.<br />That’s the message that the  Facebook  founder hammers home in one of the most elaborate concept videos ever produced by a tech company: an 80-minute video rolling out his company’s vision of “the metaverse,” which Mr. Zuckerberg believes is the next paradigm shift in computing.
