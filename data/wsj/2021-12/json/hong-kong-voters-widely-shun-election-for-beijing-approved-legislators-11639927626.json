    "body": "HONG KONG—Voters mostly shunned a citywide poll to select Beijing-approved candidates for the city’s legislature, dealing a blow to the government’s efforts to show it had popular support after a national-security crackdown that has crushed dissent in the city.<br />Turnout on Sunday was on course to be the lowest for a legislative election since the city’s return to China from British rule more than two decades ago. Just 29.3% of the city’s 4.5 million registered voters had cast ballots as of 9:30 p.m., with one hour to go until polls close. In 2016, total turnout was 58.3%. The lowest post-handover turnout previously was 43.6% in 2000."
