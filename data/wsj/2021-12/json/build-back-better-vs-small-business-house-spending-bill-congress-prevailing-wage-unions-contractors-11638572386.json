    "body": "We’ve been telling you about special political favors hidden throughout the Democratic spending bill—subsidies for the press corps, the trial bar and green energy. But the biggest single winner may be Big Labor, and one egregious example is the wage mandate for contractors that would lock out small business.<br />The Build Back Better Act the House passed last month includes $555 billion in grants, credits and deductions for green-energy projects. It also has requirements for any contractor hoping to line up for that cash. Take the tax deduction for retrofitting commercial and apartment buildings. To qualify for a job installing efficient lighting or windows, contractors must pay employees the “prevailing rates.”"
