    "body": "The judge who oversaw  Hertz Global Holdings Inc.’s  chapter 11 restructuring trimmed bondholders’ requests for early repayment premiums and interest payments, saying that some claims aren’t payable under U.S. bankruptcy law or the company’s debt contracts.<br />Judge Mary Walrath of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., said Hertz’s unsecured bondholders weren’t entitled to collect interest payments at the contractual rate following the rental-car company’s bankruptcy filing last year. The judge also absolved Hertz of any obligation to make premium payments on bonds that were scheduled to come due in 2022 and 2024 to compensate for the early retirement of those debts."
