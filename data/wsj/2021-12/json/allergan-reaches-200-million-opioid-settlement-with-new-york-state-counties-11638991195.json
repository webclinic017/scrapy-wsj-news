    "body": "Pharmaceutical maker  AbbVie Inc.â€™s  Allergan unit has agreed to pay up to $200 million to New York state and two New York counties to settle claims that it helped create a public nuisance by allowing opioids to flood the region, according to the company and the office of state Attorney General Letitia James.<br />The deal removes Allergan from a lawsuit whose trial is nearing the finish line. Closing arguments got underway Wednesday afternoon in the long-running case, which now includes Anda Inc. and other subsidiaries of parent company  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.  as defendants, following roughly $1.5 billion in settlements that released half a dozen other companies."
