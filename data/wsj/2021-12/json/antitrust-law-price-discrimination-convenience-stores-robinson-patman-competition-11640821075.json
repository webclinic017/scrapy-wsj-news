    "body": "Noah Phillips and Joshua Wright correctly note that “antitrust laws protect competition” and “competition benefits society—and consumers” (“As Inflation Rises, Antitrust ‘Reformers’ Target Lower Prices,” op-ed, Dec. 21) But dumping the Robinson-Patman Act is the wrong conclusion. Price discrimination based on arbitrary retail “channels” raises prices and hurts competition. Even when they are larger and more efficient, convenience retailers pay higher prices than competitors on a range of products, particularly sodas.<br />Convenience retailers regularly find that competitors can sell sodas for less than they can buy them wholesale. This happens regardless of purchase volume. Suppliers also refuse to sell some products to the convenience channel. These limitations make products less fungible and add to supply-chain problems."
