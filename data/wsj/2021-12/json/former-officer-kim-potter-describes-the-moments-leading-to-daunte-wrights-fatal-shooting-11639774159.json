    "body": "Kimberly Potter, the former Brooklyn Center, Minn., police officer who shot and killed Daunte Wright during a traffic stop in April, fought back tears and eventually broke down while testifying in her own defense Friday during her trial for manslaughter.<br />Ms. Potter recalled in detail the decision by an officer she was training to pull over Mr. Wright for minor infractions. Her testimony became more fragmented as she described the moments after officers tried to arrest Mr. Wright for an outstanding warrant and he broke free and attempted to drive away."
