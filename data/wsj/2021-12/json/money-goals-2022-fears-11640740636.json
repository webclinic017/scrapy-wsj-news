    "body": "Improving your financial life can sometimes feel like a Catch-22: The same money issue you need to unsnarl creates so much anxiety that you end up turning away from it altogether.<br />Seeking more insight on money issues such as debt management, building emergency savings and risk diversification could increase overall happiness. A study published earlier this year by Finra and the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center found that even before the pandemic, a low level of financial literacy was a top contributor to financial stress and anxiety. The report analyzed the survey responses of 19,000 Americans."
