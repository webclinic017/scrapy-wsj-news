    "body": "I didn’t set out to write obituaries. I suppose no one does. A couple of years ago, I began editing the quarterly magazine of an academic honor society. One of my duties involved writing death notices of deceased members.<br />The prospect of writing about death seemed daunting, especially as a pandemic spread across the globe. Amid so many headlines about loss, I didn’t relish the thought of sitting at a keyboard and focusing on the departed."
