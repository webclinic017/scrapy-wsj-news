    "body": "America owes Michael Bloomberg a debt of gratitude for supporting charter schools with his fortune (“Why I’m Backing Charter Schools,” op-ed, Dec. 2). No doubt he will have to brave insults launched by the teachers unions, but those of us whose kids attended charters know he’s right.<br />My wife and I lucked out in a charter-school lottery, and our kids attended one of the best middle schools on the East Coast: Newark Charter School in Delaware. Starting in fifth grade, NCS students dramatically increased their scores in math, reading and science. Scores for district students in the same income group dropped. Since NCS admitted students with a blind lottery, the school had gift-wrapped the state a model for increasing achievement. Instead, every day we battled teachers unions for survival, and their political allies were happy to pile on. Many of those allies, such as President Biden, sent their kids to exclusive private schools."
