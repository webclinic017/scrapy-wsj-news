    "body": "The human genome—the vast set of DNA molecules conveying our genetic blueprint—inspires wonder and amazement, not to mention entrepreneurial zeal. More than three decades ago, scientists embarked on a project to map the order of the genome’s approximately three billion DNA “base pairs,” which famously wind around each other in the shape of a twisted ladder. Dispersed in the genome are roughly 30,000 genes. These play a role in determining our physical characteristics, like eye and hair color, as well as our susceptibility to various health risks.<br />Even before the mapping of the genome was completed in 2003, biotech companies, universities and government labs were staking claims to parts of it by patenting certain genes, including those linked to particular diseases. By holding such a patent, a biotech company, say, could prevent a competitor from developing a cheaper diagnostic test or even from studying a particular gene."
