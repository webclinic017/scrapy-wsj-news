    "body": "Archbishop Desmond Mpilo Tutu visited Christ Church in Greenwich, Conn., in June 2010 and treated parishioners to a master class in the art of African storytelling. An hour felt like minutes as he held scores of listeners in his hand.<br />Tutu, who died Sunday at 90, said it was “actually quite wonderful watching yourself growing old.” Little things one used to do without a thought, like standing up, become challenging. “Now,” he said, “I have to have a discussion with my body: ‘What do you think if we both get up now?’ And quite frequently you have a revolt.”"
