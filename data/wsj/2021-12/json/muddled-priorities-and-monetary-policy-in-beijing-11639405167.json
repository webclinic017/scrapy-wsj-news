    "body": "Every year China’s top leadership gets together and hashes out economic priorities for the coming 12 months at the Central Economic Work Conference. The communiqué from this year’s conference, which wrapped up on Friday, was unusually explicit: the terms “stable,” “steady” or “stabilize” were mentioned roughly twice as many times as last year.<br />That isn’t surprising in the context of a deepening economic slowdown, and ahead of the crucial 20th Communist Party Congress next fall, when party head Xi Jinping is expected to be named to an unprecedented third term, and other top officials will also have their fates decided. It also follows a clear shift toward more stimulative monetary policy and less restrictive property policies over the past several weeks."
