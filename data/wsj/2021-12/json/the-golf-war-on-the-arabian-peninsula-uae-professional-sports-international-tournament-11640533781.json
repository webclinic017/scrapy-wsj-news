    "body": "The so-called Gulf Rift between Qatar and other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council ended early this year. But the monarchies that belong to the council compete as much as they collaborate. For the two most populous members, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, this competition is playing out in golf.<br />The U.A.E. has long been the Middle East’s leading golf destination, but Saudi Arabia is coming on strong. Although few Arabs play, the Emirates have 21 courses, including eight of the region’s top 10, according to Golf Digest. This year’s European tour—rebranded the “DP World Tour” and sponsored by Dubai Ports World—will host four men’s professional events in the U.A.E."
