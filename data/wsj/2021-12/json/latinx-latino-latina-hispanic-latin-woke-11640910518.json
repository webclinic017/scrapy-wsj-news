    "body": "Charlotte Allen’s op-ed “‘Latinx’ Isn’t Popular With Latinos” (Dec. 20) is right on the mark. In Spanish, anything pertaining to Latin culture or background is described as either “latino” or “latina,” uncapitalized. The gender distinction is a basic characteristic of romance languages, used not only to distinguish male or female, but also objects or concepts that by convention are assigned a gender: “musica latina” (Latin music) or “sabor latino” (Latin flavor).<br />In English, such a distinction does not exist. But as Ms. Allen suggests, there is already a perfectly appropriate English word, a direct translation from both “latino” and “latina” that totally describes the concept: “Latin.” I always found the capitalized use of the Spanish words unnecessary in English. Now, with this new fad of “Latinx,” we have arrived at an entirely new dimension, with a made-up word to satisfy some obscure political correctness."
