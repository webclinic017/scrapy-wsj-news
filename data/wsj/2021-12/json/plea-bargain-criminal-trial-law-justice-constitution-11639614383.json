    "body": "Clark Neily and Somil Trivedi’s op-ed against plea bargaining (“The Unconstitutional Convictions You Don’t Know About,” Dec. 13) suggests the writers are defense-minded people, perhaps unfamiliar with the daily grind of the criminal-justice system.<br />As a state’s attorney during the 1970s, I saw a plea-bargain rate of around 95%. Later, as a judge from 2006 to 2013, I saw, once again, a plea-bargain rate of around 95%. This is fairly consistent across the nation, for obvious reasons. First, lawyers on both sides can, in most cases, calculate to a high degree of accuracy the probability of conviction. Likewise, they can calculate the likely sentence. It’s therefore reasonable to settle the matter with a plea bargain that reflects these two realities."
