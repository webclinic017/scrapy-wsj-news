    "body": "Infection rates for the Omicron variant are climbing so quickly in many countries that some policy makers and public-health advisers are now setting case numbers aside to focus instead on hospitalization rates and expanded vaccination campaigns to mitigate rather than contain the latest wave of Covid-19.<br />France reported a record high of nearly 180,000 daily infections on Tuesday, but hospitalization rates remained far below earlier outbreaks, reaching 3,400 people in intensive-care units compared with highs of more than 7,000 in the spring. Some 77% of the population is now fully vaccinated, helping to soften the number of people seeking emergency care and the number of deaths. A similar pattern is playing out in England. It reported around 117,000 new infections on Tuesday, but the latest hospitalization data showed there were just over 9,500 people in the hospital, far below the 34,000-plus figures seen in January."
