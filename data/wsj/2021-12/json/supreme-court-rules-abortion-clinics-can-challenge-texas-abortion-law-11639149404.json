    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court ruled 8-1 Friday that abortion clinics can move forward with a challenge to Texas’ ban on most abortions, a decision that puts the state law in jeopardy even though the justices allowed it to remain in effect for now.<br />In a splintered opinion, the court said the head of the state medical board and other licensing authorities could be sued before the law was enforced to test its constitutionality, despite Texas’ efforts to insulate the law from federal court review by assigning enforcement power to private litigants."
