    "body": "Those who pine for the pre-“Disneyfied” Times Square of old—and there are some—will be brought up short by Joe Berlinger’s three-part Netflix series “Crime Scene: The Times Square Killer.” Mr. Berlinger doesn’t exactly wallow in the near-mythic swamp of peep shows, live sex and streetwalkers that made the West 42nd Street area in particular so notorious in the late ’70s and ’80s. But re-creating the sense of peril one felt—while trying to buy an Orange Julius, say, or get to a commuter bus circa 1979—is an essential element in what is in turn a serial-murder story, a police procedural and a cultural critique.<br />No one says it quite out loud, but underlying all else in this season 2 kickoff of Mr. Berlinger’s “Crime Scene” is the paradox of legislating morality: The more you criminalize, the more crime goes up. It was the great lesson of Prohibition. It’s also the unavoidable conclusion of a story that begins—in this telling at least—in flames."
