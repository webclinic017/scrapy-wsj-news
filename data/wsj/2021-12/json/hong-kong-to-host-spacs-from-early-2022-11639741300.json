    "body": "Hong Kong’s stock exchange will allow special-purpose acquisition companies to list from early 2022, after tweaking its proposed framework for handling listings of blank-check companies.<br />The exchange published its SPAC rules on Friday, following a public consultation that began in September, and said the listing regime would take effect on Jan. 1. SPACs are shell companies that raise money from investors and go public on stock exchanges before finding businesses with which to combine."
