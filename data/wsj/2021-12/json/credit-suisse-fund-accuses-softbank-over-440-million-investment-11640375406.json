    "body": "A  Credit Suisse Group AG  fund accused  SoftBank Group Corp.  in U.S. court filings of orchestrating transactions that rendered worthless a $440 million investment the fund had made to finance a SoftBank-backed company.<br />The filing, made Thursday in a U.S. District Court in California, asks a federal judge to permit the Credit Suisse fund to serve a subpoena on a U.S. arm of SoftBank. The filing, which says that the fund is preparing to sue SoftBank in the United Kingdom, deepens the dispute over the demise of Greensill Capital, a supply-chain finance company that tumbled into insolvency earlier this year."
