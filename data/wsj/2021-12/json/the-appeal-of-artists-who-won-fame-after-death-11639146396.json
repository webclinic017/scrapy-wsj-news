    "body": "With her men’s coats and floppy hats, her hair and cheeks shiny with Vaseline, Vivian Maier was a conspicuous figure on Chicago’s North Shore before she died in 2009 at age 83. Locals gave her an array of nicknames—Bird Lady, Army Boots, Wicked Witch—never realizing that the old woman who haunted the same park bench nearly every day would one day be deemed an artistic genius.<br />To the great shock of everyone who once knew her, including the many families who employed her as a nanny, Maier left behind an archive of over 140,000 photographs, many of which transformed the ordinary detritus of life into something extraordinary. Since the first major exhibition of her work a decade ago, selections of Maier’s oeuvre have traveled the world and are now on view in shows at the Chicago History Museum and the Musée du Luxembourg in Paris. Her sensitive, serendipitous snapshots, mostly of strangers in the cities where she lived—Chicago, Los Angeles, New York—have earned her a place in the pantheon of street photographers, alongside Diane Arbus, Robert Frank and Garry Winogrand."
