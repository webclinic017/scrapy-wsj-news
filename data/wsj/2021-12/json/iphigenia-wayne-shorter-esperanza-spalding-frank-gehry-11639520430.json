    "body": "Washington<br />Opera is about voices and foundational myths, so what better place to give a voice to the voiceless and retell myths from alternative points of view? “... (Iphigenia),” an intriguing new opera by the jazz luminary Wayne Shorter and vocalist Esperanza Spalding, which was performed at the Kennedy Center’s Eisenhower Theater this weekend, is the latest work to tackle those revisions. Like The Industry’s “Sweet Land” (2020), a multi-collaborator project that explored colonialism, and last month’s Met premiere, Matthew Aucoin and Sarah Ruhl’s “Eurydice,” which told the Orpheus legend from Eurydice’s point of view, “Iphigenia” rewrites a familiar story."
