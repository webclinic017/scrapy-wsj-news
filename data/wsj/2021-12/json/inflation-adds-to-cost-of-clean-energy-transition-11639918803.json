    "body": "Energy companies have to spend more to build solar and wind farms for the first time in years because of cost inflation and supply-chain problems, adding a financial speed bump to the switch from fossil fuels.<br />Clean-energy projects are exposed to inflation in old-school commodity markets by their dependence on materials such as silicon and copper. The wholesale price of solar panels has risen 19% in Europe this year, according to Martin Schachinger, managing director of pvXchange Trading GmbH, taking them to levels from late 2018. Prices remain about a third below where they stood five years ago."
