    "body": "The Biden administration on Thursday relaxed restrictions around an abortion pill that had prevented women from getting the medication without first making in-person visits to pick up the prescriptions at medical offices.<br />The Food and Drug Administration decision to allow patients to get the drug mifepristone, sold under the brand name Mifeprex and sometimes known as RU-486, without a visit to a hospital or doctor will help pave the way for the drug to be available for ordering online and delivery by mail, according to groups that support abortion access."
