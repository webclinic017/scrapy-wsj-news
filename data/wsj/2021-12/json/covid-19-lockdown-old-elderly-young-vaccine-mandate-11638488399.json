    "body": "As one of those “older voters” Holman W. Jenkins, Jr. refers to in “Is This a ‘Normal’ Covid Winter?” (Business World, Nov. 27), I take issue with his depiction of us as “terrified” of the virus and “unstinting in our willingness to impose costs on young people for steps that lack any real benefit.” As if it weren’t enough that, in our golden years we were forced into lives of seclusion, locked in nursing and retirement homes with meals delivered to our doors, and told we must settle for visits with kids and grandkids through closed windows for our own good, now Mr. Jenkins implies that we were behind these measures.<br />Most older folks are more philosophical about life and death than younger people. We are alarmed at the loss of freedoms and what that will mean to future generations; appalled at the costs that will be passed along to our children and grandchildren; and deeply disappointed in the politicization of a tragic event. But we are not so self-centered and tenacious of life that we would sacrifice the future of our kids and grandkids for a few more months or years in this vale of tears."
