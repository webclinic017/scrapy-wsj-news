    "body": "ON A RECENT afternoon in Northern California, aroma infused Hanson of Sonoma’s distillery as two guys armed with peelers and knives worked on cases of organic produce. The family-owned outfit was producing its cucumber vodka the old-fashioned way, by macerating the cucumber along with mint in tanks of the spirit. A refreshing, sweet-savory drink, the cucumber vodka, like all Hanson vodkas, is certified organic. What’s not to love?<br />It’s a question worth asking because, for years, vodka hasn’t gotten much love from mixologists. The generation that brought the classic cocktail revival has had little use for a spirit not found in pre-Prohibition recipes. They’ve condemned industrial vodka’s wan character and the chemicals that give it flavors like bubble gum and peanut-butter-and-jelly. An Internet search of a decade’s-worth of bartender opinions on vodka yielded venom, such as: “The people who put together crap like this do no respect to me or the drinking public.”"
