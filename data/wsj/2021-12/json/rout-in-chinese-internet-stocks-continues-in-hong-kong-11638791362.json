    "body": "Chinese internet stocks fell in Hong Kong on Monday following a selloff in comparable American depositary receipts late last week, as the fear of more U.S. delistings led many investors to re-evaluate the risks of an already battered technology sector.<br />The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks the 30 largest technology companies listed in the city, slid 3.3% to its lowest level, after  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. ,  JD.com Inc.  and other internet stocks logged sizable declines. The benchmark, which launched in July 2020, has lost close to a third of its value this year, and is down 45% from a peak in February."
