    "body": "What does a supply-chain expert do when he can’t find an oven?<br />Days before Christmas last year, Phil Levy was baking a sourdough loaf for his wife when their electric oven went kaput. A  General Electric  model from the early 1990s, it could no longer hold a temperature, so it was time to buy a new one. Mr. Levy was dismayed to find that he couldn’t get a replacement anywhere in the San Francisco area. “The retailers had little in stock,” he tells me in a Zoom call from his home in Emerald Hills. “I had to join a queue and hope for the best. All wait times were notional.”"
