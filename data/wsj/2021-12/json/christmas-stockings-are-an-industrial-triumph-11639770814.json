    "body": "Most of the stockings hanging from the Colket family’s suburban Philadelphia mantle this Christmas are what you would expect in 21st-century America. They are decorated with seasonal images in festive red, green and white. To make room for presents, they have unusually wide calves and broad, stubby feet. Rare is the person they’d fit and, given their thick seams, rarer still the shoes. Christmas stockings are symbolic gift containers, not hosiery.<br />But one of the Colkets’ stockings is different. It’s long and skinny, with a diamond checkered pattern knitted in cream and brown and darned with scattered bits of bright red yarn. “It was a men’s stocking my grandfather wore when golfing and wearing his plus fours,” explains Andrew Colket, who got the stocking from his father as a child and last year passed it down for his son’s first Christmas."
