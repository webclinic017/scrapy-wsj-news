    "body": "Montana lawmakers took the unusual step this month of asking the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene in a conflict between the judiciary and Legislature. At issue are due process and the political accountability of the judiciary.<br />State lawmakers learned this year that Montana judges had opined on proposed legislation in response to a survey of their views from Court Administrator Beth McLaughlin. Lawmakers worried that this compromised the impartiality of judges who may hear cases challenging the legality of new legislation. But when lawmakers asked to see the correspondence, Ms. McLaughlin said the emails no longer existed. Lawmakers tried to retrieve them from the Department of Administration, which houses state email archives."
