    "body": "WASHINGTON—Wall Street’s regulator is putting forward tighter rules on how and when corporate insiders can sell their companies’ stocks, just as executives are cashing in at historic levels.<br />The Securities and Exchange Commission proposed new restrictions on executive stock trading and greater disclosure requirements around company share buybacks at a meeting Wednesday. If most of the SEC’s five commissioners support these proposals, along with two others, the agency will put the changes out for public comment before voting to complete them, potentially next year."
