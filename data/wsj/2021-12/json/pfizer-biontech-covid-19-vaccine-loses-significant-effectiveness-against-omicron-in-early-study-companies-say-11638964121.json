    "body": "Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  said that a third dose of their Covid-19 vaccine neutralized the Omicron variant in lab tests but that the two-dose regimen was significantly less effective at blocking the virus.<br />A third dose increased antibodies 25-fold compared with two doses in the Omicron variant, the companies said. Still, two-doses may prove effective in preventing severe illness from Covid-19, they said, because immune cells are still able to recognize 80% of parts of the spike protein that the vaccine targets."
