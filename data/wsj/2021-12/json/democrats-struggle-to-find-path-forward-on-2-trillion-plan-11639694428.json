    "body": "WASHINGTON—Democrats attempted to chart a path forward on President Biden’s economic agenda as a series of parliamentary challenges and the concerns of Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) stalled progress on a bill the party had hoped to complete this year.<br />Democrats met Thursday afternoon to discuss the roughly $2 trillion education, healthcare and climate package, which senators are no longer expected to take up for a vote this year, according to lawmakers and aides. Lawmakers indicated that the path forward remained unclear as the Senate also sorted through a push on voting-rights legislation and confirming a series of nominees."
