    "body": "While much of the world was focused on the recent climate summit in Scotland, China had its eye on a very different environmental issue. For the fifth year in a row, China, with Russian assistance, used an international forum to prevent the establishment of new marine protected areas along the coast of Antarctica. Beijing is increasingly interested in the southern continent, and for all the wrong reasons.<br />Since 1961, Antarctica has been governed by the Antarctic Treaty, to which more than 50 countries are now party, including China. The treaty preserves Antarctica for scientific pursuits and prohibits all military activity on the continent. The 1991 Madrid Protocol banned extractive mining and seeks to preserve the unique ecosystem of the world’s last true wilderness."
