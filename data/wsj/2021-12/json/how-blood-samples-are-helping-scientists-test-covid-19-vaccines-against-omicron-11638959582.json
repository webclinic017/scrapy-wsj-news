    "body": "Human blood samples and the substance that makes fireflies glow are among the tools that scientists are using for early clues about whether Covid-19 vaccines retain their effectiveness against the new Omicron virus variant.<br />Vaccine makers including  Pfizer Inc.  and  Moderna Inc.,  plus U.S. government and academic scientists, are rushing to run lab tests expected to yield answers. Most labs expect results in a few weeks, though a South African research institute said Tuesday early findings from lab tests showed the vaccine from Pfizer and  BioNTech SE  generated one-fortieth of the infection-fighting antibodies against the Omicron variant, compared with its performance against the original version of the virus."
