    "body": "Regarding Hal Brands’s “Containment Can Work Against China, Too” (Review, Dec. 4): The clear benefit of containment of the Soviet Union was a path to global stability, economic growth, trade and civil liberties. There were missteps, but the policy won the Cold War without nuclear destruction.<br />China is today far more economically powerful than the Soviets were during the Cold War, and China’s military strength grows rapidly. To confront and contain China also requires facing an internal weakness that didn’t hamper the U.S. nearly so much then as it does now: political polarization. Our divides deny us clarity on how to move forward and limit our ability to take and sustain bold and decisive containment measures. All political elements in the U.S. must work together for national—and global—security. The architects of policy must demonstrate strategic and practical flexibility, not ideological brain freeze."
