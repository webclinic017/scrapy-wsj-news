    "body": "Peter Anthony, the head of a Chicago-area auto supplier, has spent much of this year feeling left on the sidelines in an industry delivering solid profits to car makers and dealers.<br />Raw-material prices and labor costs have soared for his firm, UGN Inc., which makes insulation products for vehicles.
