    "body": "Kroger Co.  is eliminating some Covid-19 benefits for unvaccinated employees, a move to encourage inoculations as the Biden administrationâ€™s vaccine mandate faces legal challenges.<br />The Cincinnati-based grocery chain told employees last week that it will no longer provide two weeks of paid emergency leave for unvaccinated employees who contract Covid-19, unless local jurisdictions require otherwise. Kroger will also add a $50 monthly surcharge to company health plans for unvaccinated managers and other nonunion employees, according to a memo viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Both policies are effective Jan. 1, the memo said."
