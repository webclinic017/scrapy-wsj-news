    "body": "A Spanish judge ruled that  Banco Santander SA  must pay Andrea Orcel more than $75 million for reneging on a promise to name him chief executive, in the latest twist in a fight between two of Europe’s most powerful bankers.<br />The dispute began in 2019 after Banco Santander Executive Chairman Ana Botín withdrew an offer to hire Mr. Orcel as Santander’s CEO. She said the bank couldn’t justify his €50 million-plus price tag, equivalent to $57 million at the time, which included compensation for shares he would leave behind at his then employer, UBS Group AG."
