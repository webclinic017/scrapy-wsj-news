    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”Banks are under renewed regulatory pressure to overhaul their overdraft-fee practices, which generate billions of dollars of revenue from consumers who are often cash-strapped.<br />The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees national banks, are pressing financial institutions to scale back what officials describe as an overreliance on overdraft fees, through a combination of public warnings and potential new regulation. Rules under consideration include making it easier for consumers to move money and their account histories to banks with lower fees."
