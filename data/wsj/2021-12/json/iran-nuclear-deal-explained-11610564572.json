    "body": "Nuclear talks between Iran, the U.S. and other major powers resumed on Nov. 29 in Vienna for the first time in five months, with Western concerns growing about Iran’s nuclear work and expectations for a breakthrough set low after Iran’s hard-line new government repeatedly delayed the diplomacy.<br />Iran wants to focus the talks on relief from sanctions imposed by the Trump administration after the U.S. withdrew from the deal in 2018. U.S. officials will focus on what pledges Iran will make to return to compliance with its commitments in the deal."
