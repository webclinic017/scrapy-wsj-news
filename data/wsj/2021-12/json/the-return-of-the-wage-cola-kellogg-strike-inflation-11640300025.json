    "body": "Would you rather get a raise today, or a safeguard against inflation tomorrow? Taking the raise would have been the choice for most workers until recently, but inflation is back and cost-of-living wage adjustments have come back with it.<br />The latest sign that Americans think inflation will be more than transitory is the labor agreement struck at Kellogg Co. Production workers for the cereal giant spent almost three months on strike before accepting a deal Tuesday night. Anthony Shelton, head of the union that represents the 1,400 employees, hailed the deal as a victory. The workers, he said, “stood their ground and sacrificed so much in order to achieve a fair contract.”"
