    "body": "A lawyer for Ghislaine Maxwell tried to cast doubt on an accuser’s testimony at the British socialite’s sex-trafficking trial on Wednesday, challenging the woman’s memory and showing inconsistencies with earlier statements she made to federal investigators.<br />A day earlier, the accuser, who testified under the pseudonym Jane, told jurors in a federal court in Manhattan how Ms. Maxwell helped disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse her when she was an underage teen in the 1990s. Ms. Maxwell would touch the young girl’s breasts and show her how to massage Epstein, the accuser said. In some incidents, the accuser said, she, Ms. Maxwell, Epstein and others would take off their clothes and have an orgy at his homes in Florida and New York."
