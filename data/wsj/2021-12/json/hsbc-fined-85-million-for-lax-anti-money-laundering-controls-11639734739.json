    "body": "HSBC  Holdings PLC was fined for inadequate anti-money-laundering controls that the London-based bank used to monitor hundreds of millions of dollars of transactions.<br />The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority fined HSBC £63.9 million, the equivalent of $85 million, for weak oversight at the bank between 2010 and 2018. HSBC didn’t dispute the regulator’s findings, which meant it got a 30% discount on the fine, the FCA said in a statement."
