    "body": "“Dead Man’s Switch,” about cryptocurrency and the mysterious Gerald Cotten, is a cautionary tale, especially for those thinking about estate planning: If you’re writing your will, leave someone your passwords.<br />In 2019, when Cotten died—or didn’t, which is part of the story—he left approximately $250 million locked in a cryptocurrency “vault” to which only he had the key. He died in India 12 days after modifying his will, his wife didn’t announce the death for 36 days, few saw the body and it was a closed-casket funeral. Add to this—as several crypto-covering journalists do, feigning befuddlement—the lack of a  contingency plan for the event of Cotten’s curious demise."
