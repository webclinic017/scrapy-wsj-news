    "body": "Anne Boleyn, the second of the six wives of Henry VIII and the first to lose her head, has been regarded in many ways by many people: as a seductress, a usurper, an enemy of Catholicism, a champion of Protestantism and, inarguably, the mother of Elizabeth I. It has taken several hundred years for her to be able to provide a stand-in for Meghan Markle. But how else does one read the miniseries “Anne Boleyn”?<br />The English entertainment press isn’t exactly renowned for its delicacy, but when “Anne Boleyn” made its U.K. debut in June, several reviewers ignored any Markle allegories while taking pre-emptive umbrage at the idea that anyone would object to the casting of Jodie Turner-Smith, who is Black, as the infamous Anne. Colorblind casting, for all its obvious merits, is based on the notion that a convincing performance is more critical than historical accuracy (or mere tradition), that a performer’s race is less important than his or her dramatic gifts. But in the case of “Anne Boleyn,” Ms. Turner-Smith, playing opposite the ginger-bearded Prince Harry-lookalike Mark Stanley as Henry, is part of a production that seems to be using race as a provocation, especially since Anne exhibits many of the qualities that Markle-haters maliciously ascribe to the current Duchess of Sussex."
