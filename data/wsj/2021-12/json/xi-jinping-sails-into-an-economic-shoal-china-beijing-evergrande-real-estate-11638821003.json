    "body": "Maybe China has to follow the usual economic rules after all. After many years pursuing an economic strategy dependent on a real-estate boom, Beijing is discovering it’s no easier to unwind those excesses in a state-dominated economy than it would be anywhere else.<br />This great real-estate unwind enters a new phase this week as Evergrande Group, the country’s most indebted property developer, appears set to tip into insolvency at last. The company struggled for months to fend off the wolves and disclosed Friday it owes $260 million on a credit guarantee it may not be able to pay. It was on the verge of defaulting on an $82.5 million bond interest payment as we went to press Monday."
