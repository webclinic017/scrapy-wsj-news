    "body": "In “It’s Biden’s Turn to Face Putin’s Ukraine Test” (Politics & Ideas, Dec. 29), William Galston writes that Russia could defeat Ukraine quickly, but that Vladimir Putin probably doesn’t want to invade. Mr. Putin’s misgivings make sense, as he knows that many of Moscow’s neighbors have defeated Russia in war. They include Germany (1917), Turkey (1856), Japan (1905) and newly created Poland (1918-21).<br />The armies of Napoleon and Hitler ravaged Russia. About 1 in 7 Soviets died in World War II, which began for Stalin when he invaded Poland. Even tiny Finland humiliated the Soviets early in the Winter War (1939-40). Later, Russia became bogged down for years in guerrilla wars in Chechnya and Afghanistan. It is memory of military misfortune that makes an invasion of Ukraine unpalatable to the Russian people."
