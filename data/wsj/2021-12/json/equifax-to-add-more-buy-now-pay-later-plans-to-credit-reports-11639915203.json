    "body": "A popular kind of “buy now, pay later” plan is coming to credit reports.<br />Early next year,  Equifax Inc.  will begin recording installment plans that allow shoppers to make four biweekly payments instead of covering the full cost at checkout. The move is meant to give lenders a fuller picture of people’s financial commitments, including how much they owe on these plans."
