    "body": "WASHINGTON—Wall Street regulators are set Wednesday to propose requirements for some money-market mutual funds to diminish investors’ tendency to flee the instruments during financial crises.<br />Such rules would aim to prevent episodes like the ones that occurred during the past two recessions, in 2007-09 and 2020. The Federal Reserve backstopped the funds after they were hit with a surge of redemption requests that caused credit markets to seize up."
