    "body": "For the recurring series, That’s Debatable, we take on a contentious issue of the day and present two spirited arguments—one in favor and the other emphatically opposed.<br />It’s a freezing winter morning in Vermont’s Green Mountains, and I wake up in a comfortable bed, in an old farmhouse with an exposed post-and-beam frame that’s been wrapped to keep the heat in. The sun bounces off the snow outside; inside, it is toasty and dry (unlike most local vacation rentals; I recall a few musty 1970s chalets). My husband and I bought a fixer-upper on a beautiful property on Stratton Mountain in 2014 and spent a year renovating. We chose to own for the same reason real-estate agent Cheyanne Pugliese, of Stratton’s Wohler Realty Group, says most of her clients do—to have a space for friends or family to gather with maximum relaxation and minimum logistics."
