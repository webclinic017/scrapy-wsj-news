    "body": "The unraveling of state power in eastern Oklahoma is fascinating to watch—if you don’t happen to live there. The Supreme Court last year, in a case called McGirt, basically revived a set of historical Native American reservations, which now cover about two million people and the city of Tulsa. McGirt dealt only with “federal criminal law,” and its results in that sphere have been bizarre.<br />But the latest news is that a federal court has now applied McGirt to Oklahoma’s civil power—specifically, oversight of surface mining and reclamation. Judge Stephen Friot isn’t happy about his own ruling. But he says his order against the state is “legally unavoidable” and “a prime example of the havoc flowing from the McGirt decision.” The chaos, he adds, casts doubt on “core functions of state government,” putting Oklahoma “in a uniquely disadvantaged position as compared to the other forty-nine states.”"
