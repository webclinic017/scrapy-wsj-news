    "body": "Whenever I hear that someone has found a new theory of consciousness, I start to lose my own. The puzzle of how it is that squidgy, physical brains can give rise to primitive sensations, rich emotions and complex thoughts has stubbornly resisted solution; it’s not even clear how it could be solved. So when the latest would-be Einstein announces yet another theory, my eyes start to glaze over in anticipation of drivel and disappointment. Neuroscientist Anil Seth’s “Being You” is the exception that proves the rule. If you only read one book about consciousness, it must be his.<br />Most theories of consciousness are doomed to fail because they try to solve the wrong puzzle. What the philosopher David Chalmers has called the “hard problem” is how consciousness could possibly be part of an entirely physical universe. How can the stuff of stones and bones also be the stuff of thought? The other, “easy” problem is how brain activity relates to mental activity—what the “neural correlates” of consciousness are. This problem is easy only in the sense that it presents no deep conceptual difficulties, just hard empirical lab work."
