    "body": "Regarding Walter Russell Mead’s column on Ukraine (“Crisis in Ukraine Is a Winner for Putin,” Global View, Dec. 14): The real issue is that America is now considered a very fickle ally. This is not a new problem, although President Biden’s tenure has exacerbated the situation.<br />Lacking trust, countries seek allies on which they can depend. It is in this context that one should view India’s relationship with Russia. U.S. allies have noticed Mr. Biden’s abandonment of Afghanistan and President Trump’s abandonment of the Kurds, only the most recent examples of America’s fickleness."
