    "body": "D1 Capital Partners has lost 12% in its public investments for the month of December through Monday as fears about the fast-spreading Omicron variant have fueled big stock swings in recent sessions.<br />D1 founder Daniel Sundheim wrote in a Dec. 20 letter to investors that D1 remained confident in its portfolio and was using the volatility to add to many of its stakes in companies that had recently caused losses or that it most believed in. He cited as examples travel companies that should benefit given consumers’ high savings levels and pent-up desire to travel; private companies D1 has been invested in that have gone public this year and sold off significantly, many by more than 40%; and fast-growing Internet companies."
