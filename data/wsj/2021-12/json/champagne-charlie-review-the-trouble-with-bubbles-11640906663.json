    "body": "There is a photograph, dated 1911, of the explorer Robert Falcon Scott and his team. En route to the South Pole, the men are seated around a table, looking rather the worse for wear after a celebratory midwinter meal of seal soup, roast beef, plum pudding, minced pies and an “unstinted” supply of Champagne Charles Heidsieck. Had the Champagne label’s founder still been alive, he would have been thrilled to see that his brand had made it to Antarctica.<br />In “Champagne Charlie,” Don and Petie Kladstrup present a fascinating portrait of an audacious French wine merchant during his travels around mid-19th-century America. In 1852 Charles-Camille Heidsieck decided to expand his business into the U.S. He ignored warnings that the country was dangerous. Americans were unsophisticated, he was told; they drank whiskey or beer. Outside the upper classes, wine and Champagne were practically unknown."
