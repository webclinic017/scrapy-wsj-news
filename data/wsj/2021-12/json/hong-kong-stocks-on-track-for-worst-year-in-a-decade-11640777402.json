    "body": "Stocks in Hong Kong have taken a battering in 2021, with China’s regulatory crackdowns helping to put the city’s flagship equity index on course for its biggest loss in a decade.<br />Hong Kong is among the worst-performing major markets in the world this year, thanks partly to official pressure on sectors such as e-commerce, videogames, property, gambling and after-school tutoring. Some other market stalwarts, such as big insurers, Chinese banks and Hong Kong-focused real-estate firms, have also retreated this year."
