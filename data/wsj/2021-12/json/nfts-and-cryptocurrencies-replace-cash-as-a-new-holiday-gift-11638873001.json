    "body": "Cash in little wrapped boxes or tucked inside Hallmark cards is one of the most reliable and beloved gifts. But this holiday season, cash gifts are taking a new form as cryptocurrencies and nonfungible tokens, or NFTs.<br />Giving digital money requires planning, though, as you canâ€™t simply buy one of these assets and send someone a link. Instead, they need someone to have a digital wallet already created, through a provider such as Rainbow, MetaMask or  Coinbase .  The wallet then holds the assets, effectively acting as a bank account."
