    "body": "Rooftop solar companies aren’t exactly starting out the new year with the sun shining on their faces.<br />Shares of residential solar companies  Sunrun  and  Sunnova  have fallen 19% and 15%, respectively, since the California Public Utilities Commission put subsidies for rooftop solar—known as net metering—on the chopping block in December. The commission plans to vote on Jan. 27 after taking public comments. Florida is also considering legislation that would cut such subsidies."
