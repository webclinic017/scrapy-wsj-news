    "body": "<br />Afew weeks before the November release of Adele’s album “30,” Variety reported that the British singer’s label had pressed an astonishing 500,000 vinyl copies of the record. That number is notable not just because of the degree to which it dwarfs recent top sellers in the format—Harry Styles’s “Fine Line,” the bestselling vinyl LP of 2020, moved about 232,000 units—but also because of the well-publicized production problems at pressing plants. Independent artists with nowhere near Adele’s industry muscle have described delays of a year or more in getting physical copies of their albums made. Demand for vinyl LPs far outstrips supply, which is one of several markers that suggest the album as a music format is still very much alive—and will continue to endure into the future."
