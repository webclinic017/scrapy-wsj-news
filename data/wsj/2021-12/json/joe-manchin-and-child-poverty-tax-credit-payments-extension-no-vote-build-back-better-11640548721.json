    "body": "Democrats are in recrimination mode after the implosion of their multi-trillion-dollar spending bill, and one dishonest narrative is that West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin is callous about child poverty. For months Mr. Manchin and these columns raised substantive concerns about monthly cash payments for families that Democrats have never bothered to address.<br />“Maybe Senator Manchin can explain to the millions of children who have been lifted out of poverty, in part due to the Child Tax Credit, why he wants to end a program that is helping achieve this milestone—we cannot,” the White House said. To paraphrase a line from the left’s favorite TV show about politics, “The West Wing”: This is not exactly a page out of Dale Carnegie."
