    "body": "Friday’s jobs report for November was stronger than Republicans and many in the media are saying. While the U.S. added fewer jobs than expected, the labor force swelled with new workers. What do you know? More Americans are looking for work now that the pandemic enhanced unemployment benefits have lapsed.<br />The Labor Department’s establishment survey showed the U.S. added 210,000 jobs, which is significantly fewer than the 534,000 on ADP’s private payroll report. But the unemployment rate on the government household survey fell 0.4 percentage points to 4.2%, which is 0.2 percentage points below where it was in March 2020 before lockdowns started."
