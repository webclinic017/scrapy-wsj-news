    "body": "Graham Allison and Eric Schmidt are right to note the growth in China’s science and technology sectors and call for greater support for U.S. researchers (“China Will Soon Lead the U.S. in Tech,” op-ed, Dec. 8). One must be cautious, however, in comparing scientific and innovative capacity in China and the U.S.<br />Industrial indicators, like total computer or solar-panel production, are important for geopolitics, but they are unreliable, indirect metrics at best for tracking innovation. Comparing numbers of scientific papers or patents is most useful when each place has similar standards. Comparing numbers of STEM graduates is useful when graduates are trained similarly, and when similar proportions engage in similarly advanced research after graduation. The U.S. and China are enormously far from these conditions for comparison."
