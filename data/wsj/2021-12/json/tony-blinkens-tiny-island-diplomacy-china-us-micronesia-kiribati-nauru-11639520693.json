    "body": "Even in the age of cyber attacks and hypersonic weapons, American strategists are discovering that old-fashioned physical geography matters in U.S.-China competition. One consequence is that sparsely populated island nations in the Pacific Ocean are getting heightened attention from the U.S. and its allies. The latest example is a joint investment by the U.S., Japan and Australia in an undersea cable connecting the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Kiribati and Nauru.<br />The State Department’s Saturday press release headline, “Joint Statement On Improving East Micronesia Telecommunications Activity,” may not suggest a geopolitical watershed. The countries receiving the investment have a combined population not much greater than that of Boise, Idaho, and a GDP many times lower. But they encompass 641 islands among them (mostly belonging to the FSM) in the same crucial oceanic neighborhood as U.S. bases in Guam, Hawaii and Australia."
