    "body": "H&R Block Inc.  is suing  Block Inc.,  the financial-technology company formerly known as Square Inc., for trademark infringement.<br />The tax-prep company believes Block’s recent name change will confuse customers and harm its brand. It wants Block to stop using the name and a logo it sees as “nearly identical” to its own, according to a complaint filed in federal court Thursday. (H&R Block’s logo is a green square; Block’s Cash App sports a green square with rounded corners and a white dollar sign)."
