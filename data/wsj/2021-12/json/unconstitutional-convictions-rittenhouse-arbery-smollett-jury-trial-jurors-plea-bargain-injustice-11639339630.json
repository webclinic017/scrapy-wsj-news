    "body": "Four recent trials have left Americans divided and skeptical over whether our criminal-justice system actually produces just outcomes. The conviction of three men for the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse, the conviction of Jussie Smollett for falsely reporting a hate crime, and the trial of Elizabeth Holmes for allegedly lying to investors have played out in much different ways, with legitimately controversial outcomes in the first three cases. But these prosecutions share one favorable aspect: All were decided by juries, a development that regrettably has become highly unusual in our court system.<br />Americans may disagree on the the charges or verdicts in these cases, as well as their significance for issues such as gun control, racial justice, and the right to protest peacefully. The authors of this piece, though friends with similar values and commitments to criminal justice, don’t entirely agree about the results. But we agree that it was better for all Americans that these cases were litigated in public and that citizen jurors made the final decision. It’s what befits our constitutional democratic republic."
