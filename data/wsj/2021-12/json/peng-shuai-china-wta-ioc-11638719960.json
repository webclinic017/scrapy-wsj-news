    "body": "Over the weeks that the Women’s Tennis Association has spent trying to reach the Chinese player Peng Shuai, it phoned her, emailed her, and reached out to a slew of local contacts, the organization said. The only responses it received were a pair of emails that the organization didn’t believe were written freely by Peng. The WTA’s suspicions only grew when those emails were published by Chinese state media.<br />During the same period, the International Olympic Committee has said it managed to contact Peng at least twice, holding video calls and issuing statements that she was doing well. It even made arrangements for Peng and IOC president Thomas Bach to meet for dinner in Beijing next month, ahead of the 2022 Winter Games."
