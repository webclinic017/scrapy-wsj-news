    "body": "In “The Housing Gang Is Getting Back Together for Another Bust” (op-ed, Nov. 26), Peter Wallison uses Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s recent loan-limit increases to repeat his assertion that Fannie and Freddie “brought down the U.S. housing market,” were “the true cause of the 2008 financial crisis” and will do it again. As a mortgage-insurance executive, I observed other key players driving the market to its unprecedented collapse.<br />Mr. Wallison errs in assigning Fannie and Freddie the sole blame for this disaster—though they were highly culpable. Their senior executives chased huge stock-price-driven bonuses, while abandoning their statutory obligation to sustain mortgage-loan-quality standards."
