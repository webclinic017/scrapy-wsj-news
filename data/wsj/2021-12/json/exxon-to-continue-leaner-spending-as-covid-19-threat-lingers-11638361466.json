    "body": "Exxon Mobil Corp.  said Wednesday it will maintain a conservative budget for the next five years as the outlook for oil and gas demand remains murky while coronavirus-led economic risks persist and some countries attempt to wean themselves off fossil fuels.<br />The Texas oil giant, which slashed its spending in 2020 as the world contended with waves of Covid-19, said it is sticking to decreased spending levels for years to come. Exxon will spend between $20 billion to $25 billion a year on capital investments through 2027, a 17% to 33% decrease from its pre-pandemic plans."
