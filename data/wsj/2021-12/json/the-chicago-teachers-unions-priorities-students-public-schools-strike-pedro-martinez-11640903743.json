    "body": "Chicago’s public schools will reopen Monday after the Christmas and New Year’s break. That’s the welcome word from Pedro Martinez, the Chicago Public Schools CEO. Alas, the Chicago Teachers Union may decide otherwise.<br />This month the CTU asked its members if they’d support a district-wide return to remote learning. The survey also asked what actions they’d participate in to force the Chicago schools to improve health safety measures. Corey DeAngelis, a Cato Institute adjunct scholar who is also national director of research for the American Federation for Children, reported on  Twitter  that 91% of the union members who responded said they’d participate in a “remote work action”—that is, a strike—if the schools don’t pause in-classroom learning."
