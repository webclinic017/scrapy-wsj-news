    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden was determined to make his first year in the White House one of rebuilding from the coronavirus pandemic and achieving major progress on an array of legislative priorities. But he enters the holiday season facing a series of obstacles that have damaged his political standing and left many Democrats frustrated and anxious about looming midterm elections.<br />The aggressive Omicron variant of Covid-19, following the Delta variant last summer, has driven up infections across the nation ahead of the Christmas holiday, even among those who have been vaccinated and received booster shots. Many Americans are struggling to find available tests, and the 500 million at-home tests the Biden administration has pledged to distribute won’t become available until weeks after Omicron began its rapid spread across the country. The resurgence of the pandemic represents a dramatic reversal from the president’s hopes at the start of last summer that the U.S. would achieve independence from the virus."
