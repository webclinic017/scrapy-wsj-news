    "body": "As part of the criminal-fraud trial of former Theranos Inc. Chief Executive Elizabeth Holmes, her lawyers submitted as exhibits handwritten notes she says she wrote about her daily schedule, plus instructions about how to conduct herself as head of the blood-testing startup she founded.<br />Ms. Holmes said from the witness stand last month that the notes were written between 2005 and 2009. She told jurors that they show how she would “get ready to go into the office with some of the key tenets” for how she would be or what she would focus on."
