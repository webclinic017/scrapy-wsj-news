    "body": "Now that Sen. Joe Manchin has effectively killed the Build Back Better Act, there are renewed complaints on the left about the U.S. Senate. The problem with the Senate, we are told, is that it is undemocratic. As of the 2020 census, Mr. Manchin had 1.8 million constituents while California Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Alex Padilla had 39.5 million. Yet Mr. Manchin’s vote counts the same as Ms. Feinstein’s and Mr. Padilla’s. That means a West Virginia resident has 22 times the influence in the Senate as a Californian. For Wyoming, the disparity is 68 times.<br />The proposed solution to this alleged affront to democracy is proportional representation in the Senate, like in the House. Assuming that each state would have at least one senator, proportional representation, strictly implemented, would give California 68 senators, and the Senate would consist of 575 members. A Senate of such unwieldy size might be made smaller by compromising on proportionality and allowing for one senator for every, say, one million or fewer residents. But even then the Senate would number roughly 330 members, and Wyoming residents would still have nearly double the influence of Californians."
