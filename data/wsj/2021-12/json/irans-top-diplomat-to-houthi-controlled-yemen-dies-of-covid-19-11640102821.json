    "body": "Iran’s top diplomat to Houthi-controlled Yemen has died of Covid-19 after a hastily arranged flight out of the country over the weekend, Iranian officials said.<br />Hassan Irloo, a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was smuggled into Yemen and named Iran’s ambassador in November 2020 to parts of the country controlled by the Houthis. His installment was condemned in Washington and Riyadh and seen as a sign of an emboldened Iran, as the Houthis made gains in Yemen’s civil war."
