    "body": "Like most British families, the royal family has its time-honored Christmas traditions: The holidays are usually spent at Queen Elizabeth’s country estate, Sandringham. There, before and after a hearty Christmas dinner, it is said dinner guests are invited to step on to a set of scales to assess their weight gain, a scene re-created in the 2021 movie “Spencer,” which imagines events at a royal Christmas at Sandringham in the early 1990s.<br />Unlike most British families, the royals, with 19,768 acres of grounds at Sandringham to explore, won’t have to worry about getting a break from their relatives during holidays. And Sandringham is only the tip of the royal property-portfolio iceberg, which includes castles, palaces, country houses, townhouses, city apartments, cottages and farmhouses."
