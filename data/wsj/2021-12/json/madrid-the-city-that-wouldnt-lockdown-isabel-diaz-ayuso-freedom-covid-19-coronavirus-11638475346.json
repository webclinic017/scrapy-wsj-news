    "body": "Madrid<br />Isabel Díaz Ayuso became something of a culinary sensation earlier this year. At least one restaurant named a pizza after the Spanish politician and leader of the Madrid regional government. Ms. Díaz Ayuso’s face also appeared on the label of an artisanal beer. Then there are Ayuso-style papas, which come with extra eggs; huevos is a Spanish slang term that means, roughly speaking, “guts.”"
