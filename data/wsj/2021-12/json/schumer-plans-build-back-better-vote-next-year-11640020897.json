    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said Democrats would plow forward early next year with a vote on the party’s roughly $2 trillion education, healthcare and climate package as Sen. Joe Manchin again said he wouldn’t be pressured into supporting the bill.<br />Mr. Manchin, whose backing Democrats need in the 50-50 Senate, said on Sunday that he was opposed to the bill, effectively killing it in its current form. The West Virginia Democrat said Monday that lawmakers should start from square one to rebuild a potential package and criticized the White House for its handling of talks."
