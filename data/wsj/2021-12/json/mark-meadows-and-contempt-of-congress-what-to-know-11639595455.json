    "body": "The House of Representatives voted late Tuesday to hold Mark Meadows, former President Donald Trumpâ€™s last chief of staff, in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena requiring his testimony on his activities and communications surrounding the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Here is some context for that development.<br />Mr. Meadows, 62 years old, served as a Republican representative in the House for North Carolina from 2013 to 2020. As the head of the conservative Freedom Caucus from 2017 to 2019, he became an important Hill ally to Mr. Trump, who chose him in March 2020 to be his fourth and last White House chief of staff. In that role he was considered a key witness for the House select committee investigating the buildup to and unwinding of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. A day before the full House held him in contempt for defying the subpoena, members of the committee read aloud some of the texts, handed over earlier by Mr. Meadows, that he had sent and received during the violent clashes between rioters and police at the Capitol."
