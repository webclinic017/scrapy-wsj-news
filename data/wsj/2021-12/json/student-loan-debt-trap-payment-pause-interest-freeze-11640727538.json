    "body": "“The Forever Student Loan Emergency” (Review & Outlook, Dec. 23) shows there’s more than one way to skin a taxpayer. Recurring White House fiats for suspension of student loan payments, without accrual of interest, is a nifty alternative to not-yet-passable legislation that permanently cancels most or all of the $1.6 trillion in debt. The slow drip out of Treasury—and ultimately taxpayer pockets—is more palatable than wiping $1 trillion off the books in one fell swoop with legislation that forgives as much as $50,000 in debt per student.<br />Recurring suspensions of student loan payments are, in concept, similar to the entitlement-program phaseout chicanery baked into Democrats’ stalled Build Back Better bill. The agenda is to make the programs permanent by whetting the appetites of new benefit recipients. They would then demand permanence and vote for Democrats to make it happen."
