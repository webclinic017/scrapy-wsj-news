    "body": "Every era has its favorite alcohol. Gin was America’s drink of choice in the early 20th century. At midcentury the country went crazy for vodka. This is the golden age of bourbon whiskey. More than 28 million cases of American whiskey—that is, bourbon and rye—were sold in the U.S. in 2020, yielding $4.3 billion in revenue for distillers.<br />Bourbon’s growing popularity, undimmed by the pandemic, has been a boon to Kentucky, which from its earliest days has been associated with the production of “America’s native spirit.” In 1811, according to some estimates, there were more than 2,000 distilleries in the Bluegrass State, which less than 20 years after admission had a population of more than 400,000. Most were farmers with no more than a stream and a hollowed-out log for a still—or so the story goes."
