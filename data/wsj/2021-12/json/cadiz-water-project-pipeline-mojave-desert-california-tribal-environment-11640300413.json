    "body": "The decision to permit the Cadiz pipeline (“Biden’s California Water Embargo,” Review & Outlook, Dec. 17) was slapdash and did not review the environmental consequences to the desert. That is why we sued the federal government.<br />Despite being proposed over two decades ago, the Cadiz project has not been built because it is nonsensical. It is premised on pumping and exporting water from California’s Mojave Desert—yes, a desert. The water would come from an aquifer that supports Mojave Trails National Monument and national parks such as Joshua Tree. Without water, life in the desert—from bighorn sheep to Joshua trees—would cease to exist. This potential for environmental damage is one of many reasons the project has not advanced."
