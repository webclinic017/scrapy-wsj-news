    "body": "The flamboyant young Civil War hero Elmer Ellsworth went from household name to household god in a matter of months by paying for his irrepressible bravado with his life. First, even before the war began, the spruce, handsome Ellsworth had become a 19th-century-style American idol for public displays of martial showmanship that fit, and fueled, the militant spirit that overtook the country in the run-up to actual hostilities. Then, barely 24 years old, Ellsworth became the war’s first prominent Union casualty, whose death ignited mass mourning rivaled only by the public response to Lincoln’s assassination four years later.<br />Yet, as Meg Groeling acknowledges in her straightforward, deeply researched biography, the first in 60 years, Ellsworth is now largely forgotten by the general public. The author is onto something when she asserts that, in his day, the thrilling public saber-rattling that Ellsworth engaged in “readied the North for the eventuality of the war itself.” A veteran teacher and writer specializing in military history, Ms. Groeling has mined Ellsworth’s letters, his mother’s diaries and a host of original newspaper accounts to forge a vivid inquiry into his onetime star appeal."
