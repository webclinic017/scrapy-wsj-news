    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden and top Democrats rushed to counter fresh Republican criticism that the party’s education, healthcare and climate-change bill is more expensive than it seems and will exacerbate inflation, concerns also shared by Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), a make-or break vote for the plan.<br />Democrats will need the support of all 50 of their members in the Senate to meet their goal of passing the $2 trillion Build Back Better bill before Christmas, but Mr. Manchin hasn’t signed onto the legislation, repeatedly raising concerns about its price tag and inflation. Mr. Biden said on Friday he wasn’t sure if Mr. Manchin would support the bill."
