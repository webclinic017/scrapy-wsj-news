    "body": "If you’re a TV news personality with an eight-figure salary, it was irrelevant whether you believed Jussie Smollett’s story was true. If you exercised any private mindfulness at all, you certainly didn’t let on. Your job was to maintain the audience appeal that allows you to keep drawing a big TV salary, which meant exhibiting your own antiracist bona fides and not hinting even slightly that there was anything fishy about Mr. Smollett’s story of racial victimization.<br />Ditto Joe Biden. When he tweeted “We are with you, Jussie,” he was only serving the interests of Joe Biden."
