    "body": "Several vaccine makers are racing to develop revamped Covid-19 shots against Omicron in case the highly mutated variant renders the existing shots less effective. But it isn’t yet clear that the immune response can be fine-tuned to the new strain by boosting with a tweaked vaccine.<br />A big hurdle for developing variant vaccines is what immunologists call “original antigenic sin,” a phenomenon documented in flu and other infectious diseases, where the body returns to the immune response mounted against its first encounter with a pathogen—or vaccine—when faced with a slightly different variant."
