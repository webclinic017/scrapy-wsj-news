    "body": "SAN JOSE, Calif.—Closing arguments begin Thursday in Elizabeth Holmes’s criminal-fraud trial, marking the final opportunity for prosecutors and defense lawyers to sway jurors to their side of the case.<br />Ms. Holmes, the founder of now-defunct blood-testing startup Theranos Inc., is fighting 11 charges of conspiracy and fraud claiming that she lied to investors and patients about the company’s technology. The 2018 indictment alleges that Ms. Holmes inflated revenue projections, lied about Theranos’s relationship with the military and falsely touted the ability of Theranos devices to test for some 200 health conditions using just a few drops of blood from a finger prick."
