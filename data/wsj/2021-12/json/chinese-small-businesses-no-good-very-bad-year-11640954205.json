    "body": "U.S. small-business owners are dealing with high inflation and scarce workers. China’s small businesspeople are facing a different, but no less worrying set of challenges. By some indicators, 2021 is shaping up to have been the worst year for China’s small entrepreneurs in a long, long time.<br />China’s economy as a whole is struggling, but the pain is concentrated at the bottom—small firms, which account for an outsize percentage of employment, are paddling especially hard. In a sense, that is unsurprising: during downturns small companies, which lack leverage with suppliers and usually have shakier access to finance, often tend to do worse. But by some measures there has been a longer-term downward drift in the fortunes of China’s small companies across business cycles, which is more worrying and suggests a structural deterioration in the environment for entrepreneurs."
