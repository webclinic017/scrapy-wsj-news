    "body": "Matt Doheny, a co-owner of ABC Sports & Fitness in Latham, N.Y., made a decision earlier this month that lost him gym members: a ban on those who aren’t vaccinated against Covid-19.<br />He said denying people exercise goes against his beliefs. But it was a choice he was forced to make after New York state recently instituted new rules that said all businesses in the state had to either have Covid-19-vaccinated patrons or have them wear masks indoors."
