    "body": "So far, the impact of the Omicron variant on the airline industry has been more bark than bite. Unfortunately, a loud bark may be enough to keep the lucrative business traveler at bay.<br />Global airline seat capacity is up almost 4% this week, the latest figures from travel-data firm OAG show. While this is still 26% below pre-pandemic levels, it suggests that carriers’ short-term plans haven’t been disrupted by news of a more vaccine resistant Covid-19 strain. Across Africa, where the scare started about three weeks ago, seat capacity last week was down 3.5% relative to pre-Omicron levels, but it is now almost 5% above where it was. Cuts in North America and Eastern Europe were similarly short lived."
