    "body": "OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP spent years building a restructuring plan to settle thousands of lawsuits and deliver funding to combat the opioid crisis. That plan is in limbo after a federal judge ruled that a deal the company struck with its owners isn’t allowed under the law.<br />After U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon’s surprise ruling last week overturning a roughly $4.5 billion settlement between the OxyContin maker and members of the Sackler family who own the company, Purdue, once on the verge of settling an onslaught of lawsuits over its flagship opioid painkiller, will remain in bankruptcy court as it attempts to salvage a settlement that took years and hundreds of millions of dollars to craft."
