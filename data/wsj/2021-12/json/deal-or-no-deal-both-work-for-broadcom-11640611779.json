    "body": "It took a while, but the market finally seems to have come back around on  Broadcom .<br />The chip maker—the fifth largest by annual revenue—has missed out on much of the rally that has propelled the market values of many of its peers over the past few years. Broadcom lagged the  gains by nearly 13 percentage points in 2020 and 36 points the year before, and was running behind for most of this year up to the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter report earlier this month. The stock has since jumped 14%, giving Broadcom a gain of 57% this year compared with the peer index’s rise of 41%."
