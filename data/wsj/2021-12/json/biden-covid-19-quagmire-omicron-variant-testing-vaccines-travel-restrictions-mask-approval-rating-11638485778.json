    "body": "Candidate Joe Biden’s fib was that he could “beat” a global virus. President Biden’s mistake was to swallow his own whopper. Welcome to the Biden virus quagmire.<br />The White House on Thursday released its latest list of Covid rules in anticipation of a rise in winter cases and the arrival of the Omicron variant. The administration imposed new testing rules for international travelers, extended its transportation mask mandate, and announced it would launch hundreds of vaccination clinics and a campaign for boosters, distribute 25 million free tests, and allow reimbursement for home testing."
