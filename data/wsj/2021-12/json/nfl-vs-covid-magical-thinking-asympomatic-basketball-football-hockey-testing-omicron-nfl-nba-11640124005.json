    "body": "The U.S. continues to fight a phantom version of Covid-19—the Covid of superstition, not science. Example: The Los Angeles Times last week insisted on a “1% to 2% death rate that’s prevailed across much of the pandemic.” An Associated Press columnist claimed the “virus still has a death rate of 1.6% in the U.S.—roughly 16 times greater than the flu.”<br />If so, in a pandemic the CDC says has infected nearly half of Americans, then 2.5 million have died, which obviously they haven’t."
