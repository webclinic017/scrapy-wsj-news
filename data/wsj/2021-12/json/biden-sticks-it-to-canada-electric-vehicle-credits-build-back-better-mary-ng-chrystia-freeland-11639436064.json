    "body": "Canadians are known for their congeniality, at least by world diplomat standards. So it’s worth noting that our neighbors to the north are becoming increasingly frustrated with the way President Biden and Democrats are treating them.<br />The latest evidence comes in a stiff letter by two Canadian ministers to U.S. Senators objecting to the electric-vehicle subsidies in the Build Back Better legislation. Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland and trade minister Mary Ng advertise their stalwart climate credentials. But they say they “are deeply concerned” that the EV credits in BBB violate the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal."
