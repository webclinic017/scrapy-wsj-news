    "body": "I shudder for the graduates and parents who have saddled themselves with six-figure debt to the government that accrues above-market interest, is difficult to repay or renegotiate and is essentially nondischargeable in bankruptcy (“Why Congress Won’t Tackle Student Debt,” Page One, Dec. 9).<br />During my 20 years on the bankruptcy bench, I presided over many student-loan cases of people who had borrowed tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars that they couldn’t pay. There’s a reason no rational commercial lender would have made these loans: There’s no way these borrowers will earn enough to repay them. Sadly, there was little I could do for these unfortunate people."
