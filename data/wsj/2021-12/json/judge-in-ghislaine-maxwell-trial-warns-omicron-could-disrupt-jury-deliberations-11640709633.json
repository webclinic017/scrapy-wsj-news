    "body": "The jury deciding whether to convict British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell of sex-trafficking charges might need to deliberate each day this week and over the weekend if a verdict isn’t reached, a federal judge said Tuesday, fearing a surge in Covid-19 cases in New York City could disrupt the trial.<br />Jurors were previously scheduled to be off Thursday and Friday for the New Year’s Eve holiday. However, U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan, who is presiding over the case, said in court that “an astronomical spike” in the number of Covid-19 cases in New York had changed her thinking."
