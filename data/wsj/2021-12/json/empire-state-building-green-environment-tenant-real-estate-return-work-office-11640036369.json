    "body": "Regarding “The Future of the Office: Shorting the Empire State Building” (Exchange, Dec. 11): The Empire State Building and  Empire State Realty Trust  (ESRT) continue to attract high-quality tenants. ESRT’s largely prewar buildings are attractive to tenants for whom “flight to quality” means leadership in indoor environmental quality, healthy buildings, energy efficiency and amenities.<br />All-glass skyscrapers with asking prices of $100 per square foot and up are unaffordable to most New York businesses; they can’t lease and return to their offices at that price. ESRT’s prepandemic shift to MERV 13 filters, active bipolar ionization and increased ventilation offers what tenants want to return to the office with confidence."
