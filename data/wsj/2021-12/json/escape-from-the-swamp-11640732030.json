    "body": "This column recently noted the rising phenomenon of “protest tourism” in which people come to Washington to petition their government for a redress of grievances—and also enjoy an increasing variety of intriguing dining options. Now it seems that while activists may love to visit, fewer people want to live there. It is a striking change after a long period of robust D.C. population growth coinciding with massive expansion of the federal government.<br />President Joe Biden has been trying hard to make the federal government much bigger, but the fat of the land is suddenly not enough to entice people to stay. Could it be that D.C. residents have already grown tired of protest tourists? Possibly, but Washington is just one part of a larger trend. Looking at nationwide data, a clear picture emerges of people fleeing heavily governed jurisdictions for those with lighter bureaucratic burdens."
