    "body": "The White House has handled Sen. Joe Manchin with all the dexterity of a skating giraffe, misjudging the West Virginian for much of a year. But the prize for political malpractice may yet go to Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, with his new vow to place Joe Biden’s agenda on the Senate floor without majority support.<br />Democrats are still reeling from Mr. Manchin’s Sunday rejection of their multitrillion-dollar reconciliation plan, though the real wonder is the surprise. It isn’t only that Mr. Manchin has clearly and consistently stated his objections since the summer. Democrats also ramped up a bullying campaign that was destined to push him to the breaking point."
