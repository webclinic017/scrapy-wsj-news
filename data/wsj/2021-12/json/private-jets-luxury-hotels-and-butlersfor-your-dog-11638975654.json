    "body": "ELLIE SUFI adopted a dog in the early months of the pandemic. Ms. Sufi, 27, who had been living alone in a studio in downtown Chicago, said that Enzo, her French bulldog, got her through the loneliness of 2020. In September, she wanted to spoil him a bit so she booked a staycation for the two of them at the Ambassador Chicago, where a new package aims to pamper not only human guests but also furry, four-legged ones.<br />After a year of bonding at home with their animals, many pet owners are deciding to take their critters, especially their dogs, on the road. Several travel companies are paying attention to the trend, rolling out luxury amenities that take “pet-friendly” to new levels. Increasingly, the options for canines and other companions are five-star and priced to match."
