    "body": "Chinese policy makers are suddenly sending much stronger signals about supporting growth. The last big data release of 2021, published Wednesday, shows why.<br />November economic figures show consumers struggling, industry trending sideways and the property sector still in deep trouble—although with tentative signs of a bottom in sales and some heavy industrial activity. China’s economy is still in serious trouble and more policy support, both fiscal and monetary, will be needed to avert an even steeper downturn next year. Growth numbers heading into the spring will at least be cast in a somewhat more flattering light compared with a weak year-earlier period."
