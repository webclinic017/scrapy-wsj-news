    "body": "Under the guise of regulating greenhouse-gas emissions, the Environmental Protection Agency recently announced new, more stringent fuel-efficiency standards for passenger cars and light-duty trucks. The new standards affect vehicles starting with the 2023 model year, and 2026 vehicles will be required to achieve a fleetwide average of 55 miles per gallon, an increase of more than 35% from the current 40 mpg standard for 2021. The EPA intends to impose even more stringent standards for 2027 models and beyond.<br />Auto makers say the new standards can’t be met without more government subsidies for electric vehicles and charging infrastructure. The EPA projects that an auto maker can meet the 2026 standards if electric vehicles make up about 17% of its sales."
