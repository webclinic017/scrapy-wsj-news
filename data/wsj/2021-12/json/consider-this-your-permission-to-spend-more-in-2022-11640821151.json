    "body": "Here’s a prescription for money happiness in 2022: Accept the fact that you’ll likely spend more money than you did in 2021.<br />With inflation driving up the cost of food, rent and more, pressures are mounting on our wallets, so expecting your spending to stay in line with the past year is both unrealistic and a recipe for feeling guilt and self-recrimination. The key, financial planners and researchers say, is thinking ahead about where that extra spending will happen and quieting the voice in your head comparing your expenses from one year to the next."
