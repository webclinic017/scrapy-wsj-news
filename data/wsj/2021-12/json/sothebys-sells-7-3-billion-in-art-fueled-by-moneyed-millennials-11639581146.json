    "body": "One of the world’s chief auction houses has put the pandemic behind it, thanks mainly to millennials who splurged on everything from designer watches to digital artworks.<br />After suffering double-digit sales losses two years ago, Sotheby’s said Wednesday it sold $7.3 billion in art in 2021, a new high bar for the 277-year-old company. That figure breaks down to $6 billion in auction sales in 2021, up 71% from the year before, and $1.3 billion in privately brokered art sales, up nearly a third from the year before."
