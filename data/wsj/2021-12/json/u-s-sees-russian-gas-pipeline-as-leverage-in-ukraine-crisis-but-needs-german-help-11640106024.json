    "body": "WASHINGTON—A Russian pipeline carrying natural gas to Germany is emerging as a potential point of leverage for the U.S. to deter Russia from invading Ukraine. It is also a sore spot between Berlin and Washington.<br />The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is completed but not yet certified for operation, is a key component of German energy plans, a potential source of Russian revenue and, U.S. officials said, a topic of discussions between Washington and Berlin over how to stop Russia’s military pressure on Ukraine."
