    "body": "It’s past time that Americans heard more about what’s inside President Biden’s Build Back Better plan than about the sticker price. For starters, the budget numbers cover 10 years, a decade in which the Congressional Budget Office projects $288 trillion worth of economic output. So a BBB plan of $1.75 trillion or so would amount to roughly 0.6% of gross domestic product—slightly more than the 0.5% Americans spent last year on tobacco.<br />For reasons both technical and economic, no one can make accurate budget projections 10 years ahead. Try forecasting what GDP, tax revenue and spending will be over a decade. But another huge source of forecasting error is political. Try forecasting the decisions of Congress over a decade."
