    "body": "Kevin Warsh overstates the Fed’s responsibility for inflation (“The Fed Is the Main Inflation Culprit,” op-ed, Dec. 13). The Fed’s bond buying and its zero-interest-rate policy may have contributed, but they are not the main reason inflation has accelerated. The Fed purchased a large amount of securities between late 2008 and 2014 and kept the funds rate at zero from late 2008 to December 2015, and inflation remained below the Fed’s 2% target.<br />Mr. Warsh ignores the role of the Cares Act. The act gave individuals and businesses trillions. A significant amount of this money went to people who didn’t need it—those with twice the median income. The money giveaway was the equivalent of a helicopter money drop. Most economists believe that a very large helicopter money drop would produce inflation. It is likely the Cares Act is the main inflation culprit."
