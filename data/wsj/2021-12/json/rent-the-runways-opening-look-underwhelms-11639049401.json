    "body": "Rent the Runway  could have really used a Hadid sister to bring its figures to life.<br />The fashion-rental company released its first earnings report Wednesday since going public in late October. For the period ended Oct. 31, revenue of $59 million and loss of $5.6 million on the basis of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were both modestly better than analysts’ forecasts, while guidance for both metrics for the current quarter came in roughly in line."
