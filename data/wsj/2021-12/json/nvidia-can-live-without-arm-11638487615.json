    "body": "Welcome to Big Tech,  Nvidia .<br />The chip maker’s proposed acquisition of Arm Holdings was never a sure thing. The prospect of a single firm taking control of the vast library of intellectual property that underpins much of the wireless and computing ecosystem was always sure to draw opposition from rivals. An American chip maker taking control of one of Europe’s major tech success stories also was a dicey idea politically; U.K. regulators had been giving the deal a close look. But Nvidia didn’t even benefit from home court advantage: The Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against the deal on Thursday, arguing that the combination could “unfairly undermine Nvidia’s rivals.”"
