    "body": "The end of the year is an excellent time to re-evaluate your investment portfolio—especially this year. If you started 2020 with the often recommended ratio of three quarters of your assets in common stocks and one quarter in safe bonds, that’s not the ratio you actually have now. Stocks enjoyed returns of about 25% this year, while indexed bond portfolios declined. Your stock allocation will likely be more than four times what you have in bonds.<br />But while traditional advice is right that you should rebalance your portfolio back to a 3-to-1 ratio of stocks to bonds, the current state of the economy and market makes it tricky. With interest rates so low, most bonds don’t offer attractive returns. Even if inflation falls back down to the 2% Federal Reserve target, a 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yielding 1.5% will still have a negative rate of return after inflation. High-quality bonds from foreign countries have negative yields. And if inflation remains elevated or increases, bond prices are likely to fall as the Fed is forced to raise interest rates."
