    "body": "SYDNEY—Australia signed a contract worth about $717 million to buy self-propelled howitzers from South Korea, broadening its military cooperation as it seeks to counter China’s influence in the Indo-Pacific region.<br />The contract, while relatively small, marks the latest step in Australia’s efforts to overhaul its military to create a larger, more powerful force that also includes acquiring nuclear-powered submarines using U.S. technology and building its own guided missiles. Last year, the government said it would spend roughly $186 billion over 10 years on high-tech defense programs including long-range missiles, offensive cyber capabilities and radar surveillance."
