    "body": "Brazil has pulled a bait-and-switch that will diminish the country’s already-damaged standing with international investors.<br />The National Congress this month rushed to pass legislation to allow the government to avoid paying billions of dollars in precatórios—court-ordered government payments to individuals and companies, many of which were encouraged to do business in Brazil by government pledges of prompt payment. Precatórios are a government expense that operate like government-issued bonds when they go unpaid. At that stage, they often are resold on the secondary market as sovereign debt."
