    "body": "Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite who is accused of conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse underage girls, has been on trial since late last month.<br />Ms. Maxwell, 59 years old, has pleaded not guilty. Her lawyers have argued she is a scapegoat for Epstein, who died in his jail cell in August 2019, about a month after his indictment on sex-trafficking charges. The New York City medical examiner ruled his death a suicide."
