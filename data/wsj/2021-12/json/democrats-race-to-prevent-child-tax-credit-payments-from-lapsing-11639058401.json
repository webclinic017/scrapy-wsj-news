    "body": "WASHINGTON—Democrats are racing to keep monthly child tax credit deposits flowing to households, using the payments’ potential lapse to build momentum for finishing their roughly $2 trillion education, healthcare and climate bill before December ends.<br />Unless Congress acts, the monthly payments from the Internal Revenue Service will stop after next week’s deposits, ending a program that has propped up millions of households’ finances since it started in July. Beyond that, many lawmakers have put the credit at the center of their campaigns for next year’s midterm elections and are eager to promote it as soon as they can."
