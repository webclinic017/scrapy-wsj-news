    "body": "As Turkey’s economy heads into a tailspin because of the collapse of its currency, the lira, investors and economists wonder why President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has continued the eccentric economic policy that caused this crisis. He has made clear that his motivation is primarily religious.<br />Mr. Erdogan has dominated Turkish politics for nearly 20 years in a variety of roles—head of the Justice and Development Party, prime minister and president. Two notable features marked the first half of his rule: constant worry that the fervently secular military leadership would stage a coup, and extraordinary economic growth."
