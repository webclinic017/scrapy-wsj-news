    "body": "Does a progressive activist who wants to weaken copyright and speech protections belong on the Federal Communications Commission? President Biden thinks so, and bizarrely so do the leaders of conservative Newsmax Media and One America News Network (OAN).<br />Mr. Biden’s FCC nominee Gigi Sohn was grilled during her Senate Commerce Committee confirmation hearing last week about her fiercely partisan statements that we highlighted in an editorial last month. She’s lambasted  Fox  News as “state-sponsored propaganda” and suggested that  Sinclair Broadcast Group ’s  license should be yanked. (We have a weekend TV show on Fox News, and our owner,  News Corp . , shares common ownership with Fox Corp.)"
