    "body": "The world uses English as a lingua franca because it makes sense for millions of people (“The Downside of English’s Dominance,” Review, Nov. 27). My grandfather in India mandated the use of English in his house so his family could make progress. Many years later, my father scolded me for not learning a language before a military deployment to Europe. “Which one?” I responded. I was stationed in Italy with responsibilities in the Balkans and travel to Greece and Germany. On later overseas trips, I always found a way to communicate. In South Korea, price negotiation was done by typing numbers in a hand-held calculator.<br />My son spent many hours learning Swedish to work in a laboratory in Stockholm, only to learn that his co-workers all use English. They are from all over and are enabled by a common language independently selected by millions of people around the world."
