    "body": "Seventeen years after its construction began, the most powerful space telescope ever built is stowed, folded neatly, inside the nose cone of a rocket poised to launch Saturday from a pad in Kourou, French Guiana.<br />Scientists around the world expect that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s James Webb Space Telescope, beleaguered by a 10-year delay and cost overruns, will herald a new era of discovery in space. One hundred times as powerful as the Hubble Space Telescope, Webb will help astronomers peer at some of the oldest galaxies and stars in the universe, search for signs of habitability in the atmospheres of planets outside our solar system and study mysterious forces like dark energy using its infrared sensors."
