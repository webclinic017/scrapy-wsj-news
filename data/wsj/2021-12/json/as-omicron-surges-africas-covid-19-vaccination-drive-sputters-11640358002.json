In the Democratic Republic of Congo, fewer than 260,000 vaccines have been administered and more than three million shots are due to expire in January.<br />In Uganda, thousands of residents are being turned away at vaccination centers in rural areas. Though there are millions of doses stored in the capital, Kampala, outlying vaccination sites lack the refrigeration facilities needed to store the  Pfizer Inc.  and  Moderna Inc.  shots, squeezing supply."
