    "body": "BRUSSELS—Europe has overtaken China in creating billion-dollar tech startups, according to a new analysis that points to Europe’s rising status in the field and the effect of Beijing’s crackdown on capitalist entrepreneurialism.<br />Over the past year, China has reined in its most successful and freewheeling tech giants, including  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. ,  Tencent Holdings Ltd.  and  Didi Global Inc.,  casting a chill across the whole sector. Europe, meanwhile, has attracted further investment in its expanding tech industry, particularly from U.S. funds."
