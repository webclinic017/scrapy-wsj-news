    "body": "Chinese artificial-intelligence giant SenseTime Group Inc. filed revised documents for a Hong Kong initial public offering and said it still plans to list before the end of the year, after the U.S. government moved to restrict American investors from buying its stock.<br />Early Monday in Hong Kong, the company said it would relaunch its IPO later the same day. It still aims to raise the equivalent of up to $767 million, with a maximum valuation of $17 billion—unchanged from its original offering plan. The company’s shares will start trading on Dec. 30."
