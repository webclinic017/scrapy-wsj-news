    "body": "YOU’LL ALWAYS find something shimmering from one of Terence Ho’s ears. The 21-year-old London undergraduate student, who’s about to start a job at accounting firm KPMG, wears sterling-silver ear cuffs by London jeweler Alan Crocetti to parties and lectures alike. He slides them onto his lower or upper cartilage, where they hang like mini gemstone-encrusted chandeliers.<br />His university mates are similarly enthused. A slew of them festoon their lobes, conches (the middle of the ear) and helixes (outer-ear cartilage) with pirate-like hoops, studs and charms. “People don’t see these as…a signal toward a certain sexuality,” said Mr. Ho, whose straight and gay male friends have embraced statement earrings. They’re “just something cool to wear.”"
