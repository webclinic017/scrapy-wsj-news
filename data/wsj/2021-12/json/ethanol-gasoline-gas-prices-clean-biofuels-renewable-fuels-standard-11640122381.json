    "body": "As an avid reader of the Journal, I feel compelled to respond to the editorial board following last week’s release of renewable volume requirements by the Environmental Protection Agency (“Biden Raises the Ethanol Gas Tax,” Review & Outlook, Dec. 16).<br />Gasoline needs an additive to help it burn more cleanly and ethanol is the cheapest option. Gasoline used to contain something called MTBE for that purpose, but it may have been causing cancer. The Renewable Fuel Standard law was actually proposed by petroleum producers, who came to me to get them out of that pickle. The credits that some refiners chose to purchase rather than blending biofuels were also their idea to make compliance easier, and the EPA has consistently found that they do not impose significant costs on refiners, as the editorial claims."
