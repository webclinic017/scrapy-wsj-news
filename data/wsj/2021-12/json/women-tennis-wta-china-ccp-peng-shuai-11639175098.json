    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Advantage, Women’s Tennis Association” (Dec. 2): I remember as a young boy hearing Flip Wilson’s comic line, “the devil made me do it,” to explain his missteps. Even as kids, we knew that the devil excuse was lame and inexcusable. Yet I’m reminded of the line whenever I read about the NBA’s or BlackRock’s refusals to challenge China’s abuses of human rights. These entities must know that they are dealing with a devilish regime, but they remain silent and engaged for the sake of revenues.<br />Thanks to the WTA for not bowing to this same revenue leverage. It is to be admired, and supported, by other corporate interests, which I hope will now step up to fund WTA tournaments worldwide in the months and years ahead."
