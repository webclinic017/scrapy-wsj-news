    "body": "The Democrats’ Build Back Better bill might reward political allies, but ordinary Americans would be hurt the most. That’s particularly true for seniors on fixed incomes in the case of “The Stealth Home-Heating Tax” (Review & Outlook, Dec. 10). The Democrats should hear what Claudette Duff, president and CEO of Integrity Senior Services, said to us last month about this home-heating tax: “I am concerned that vulnerable seniors are not being considered. While I believe we must battle climate change, I am also painfully aware that most seniors have little financial wiggle room. . . . Any possibility of an added cost to [seniors] must be seriously considered.”<br />Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.)"
