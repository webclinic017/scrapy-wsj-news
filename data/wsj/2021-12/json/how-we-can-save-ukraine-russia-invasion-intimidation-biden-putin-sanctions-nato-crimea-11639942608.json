    "body": "“What’s mine is mine, and what’s yours is negotiable.” John F. Kennedy’s famous description of Nikita Khrushchev’s attitude toward Berlin applies to Vladimir Putin and Ukraine today. But this time Washington has misjudged the threat. We need to recalibrate our strategy.<br />The U.S. would be lucky if Mr. Putin honestly wants to negotiate. He’s moved more than 120,000 troops into position for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Putin comically refers to the military buildup as a “training exercise,” but there’s no mistaking the purpose of a force that size. And if such an invasion is successful, Ukraine could be only his first stop. Our nearby allies, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia—and the thousands of American troops stationed there—could be next. That’s why I recently went to Ukraine to ensure the U.S. is prepared. But I found that Ukrainian and American plans aren’t properly aligned to deter Russian aggression."
