    "body": "WASHINGTON—An annual defense-policy bill that typically passes Congress with broad bipartisan support has been slowed in the Senate by a handful of controversial policy issues regarding Russia and China, as well as the pressures of the year-end Senate calendar.<br />The National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, includes pay raises for troops and money for military construction, ships and aircraft. This year’s $777.9 billion package would boost military spending by about 5% over last year’s budget."
