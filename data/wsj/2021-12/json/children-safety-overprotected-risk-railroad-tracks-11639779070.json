    "body": "“Flirted with danger” is a grave understatement of the risks Bob Brody and his friends took by placing items on the tracks, using railroad tracks for shortcuts, playing chicken with the train and more (“Don’t Play Chicken With a Train,” op-ed, Dec. 14). In 2020 alone, according to Federal Railroad Administration statistics, 525 people were killed and 557 injured in trespassing incidents across the U.S. We shouldn’t romanticize deadly and illegal activities like track trespassing that may inadvertently encourage people to put themselves in harm’s way.<br />Rachel Maleh"
