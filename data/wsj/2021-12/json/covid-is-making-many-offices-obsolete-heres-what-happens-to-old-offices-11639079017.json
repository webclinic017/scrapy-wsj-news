    "body": "Allstate Corp.’s  suburban campus outside Chicago, with its interconnected buildings, manicured grounds and acres of parking, represented a new vision for the U.S. office when it opened in 1967. That vision is now dead.<br />The insurer reached a deal last month to sell most of the campus.
