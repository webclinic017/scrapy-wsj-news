    "body": "China Evergrande Group  said it has come up with a new repayment plan for disgruntled individual investors who previously purchased its wealth-management products, as the beleaguered property giant takes further steps to work through a mountain of financial liabilities and overdue payments.<br />The conglomerate, which earlier this month sought government help to manage its debt crisis, on Friday said one of its units has proposed to pay almost all holders of its wealth-management products 8,000 yuan—equivalent to $1,255—a month from December to February. The unit, which is known as Evergrande Wealth, said it would come up with another payment plan in March."
