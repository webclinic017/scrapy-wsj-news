    "body": "A federal appeals court on Wednesday ruled that four Dallas police officers can be held liable in the 2016 death of Tony Timpa, a mentally ill Dallas man who died after police knelt on his back and shoulders for more than 14 minutes in an encounter captured on body-camera footage.<br />A three-judge panel of the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed last year’s ruling by a federal judge who dismissed a civil suit brought by Mr. Timpa’s family. Prosecutors earlier decided not to pursue any criminal charges."
