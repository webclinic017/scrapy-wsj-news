    "body": "Regarding “Stupid Inflation Tricks” (Review & Outlook, Nov. 29): By far the greatest factor in the cost of raising a turkey (or a pig or nearly any other meat animal) to market size is the price of the grain the animal eats. Because of rising world demand and so-so global production levels, the prices of corn and soybeans have jumped over 50% in the last two years. Meat prices reflect that cost increase.<br />For Sen. Elizabeth Warren to blame poultry executives for the higher cost of your Thanksgiving dinner, with no evidence other than the price, is reckless, defamatory and either ignorant or disingenuous. Or, as I suspect, all of the above."
