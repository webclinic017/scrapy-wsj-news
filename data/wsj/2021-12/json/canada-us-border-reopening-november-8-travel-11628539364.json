    "body": "For more than 16 months, the U.S. and Canada turned away tourists at entry points across the 5,500-mile land border in an effort to contain further spread of Covid-19. On Aug. 9, Canada began allowing fully vaccinated Americans to enter the country again, and on Sept. 7, Canada expanded that reopening to include fully vaccinated visitors from other countries.<br />The U.S. started on Nov. 8 to allow fully vaccinated foreign nationals to cross the land borders from Canada and Mexico for nonessential purposes. The U.S. and Canada are keeping their shared border open while the two countries impose new rules to address worries over the Covid-19 Omicron variant."
