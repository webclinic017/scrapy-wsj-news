    "body": "I was thrilled when I joined the board of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research seven years ago. But last week I resigned. I’m no longer confident the institute can ethically push the boundaries of science for the good of humanity while working with institutions beholden to the regime in China.<br />My stepfather, the late Patrick McGovern, founded the institute in 2000 to foster knowledge of the human brain and cure diseases. He was a global pioneer, who expanded the institute’s partnerships with institutions in China during a more optimistic time in that country."
