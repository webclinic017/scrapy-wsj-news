    "body": "BAGHDAD—Iraq’s top court Monday rejected a challenge to the results of the country’s parliamentary election, in a defeat for a powerful pro-Iran faction that paves the way for the formation of a new government.<br />Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, an independent-minded nationalist, won the largest share of seats in the October poll. The Fatah Alliance, aligned with Iran-backed militias, lost significant ground in the vote and alleged voter fraud despite the election being validated by international observers and Iraq’s electoral commission."
