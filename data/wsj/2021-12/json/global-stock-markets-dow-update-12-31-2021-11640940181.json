    "body": "U.S. stock futures were muted on the last trading day of the year, indicating a quiet finish in a year of repeated records on Wall Street on low interest rates and the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines.<br />Futures for the S&P 500 edged down less than 0.1% Friday. The broad-market index finished slightly lower Thursday but is on course to finish the year about 27% higher, which would be its largest annual percentage gain since 2019. Contracts for the tech-focused Nasdaq-100 and futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average each ticked almost 0.1% lower Friday."
