    "body": "Explaining the supply-chain crisis is like a blind man describing an elephant. It depends on where you grope. Drawing conclusions from a single point of contact can be misleading.<br />“An Insider Explains The Supply-Chain Crisis” by Tunku Varadarajan (Weekend Interview, Dec. 18) makes the reasonable point that shifts in consumer behavior contribute to the crisis. But demand for new ovens or toilet paper isn’t changing only because of the crisis. While timing and mix of demand will vary, the pandemic-related delays are caused by how disruptions affect the internal workings of the supply chain. The tanker stuck in the Suez Canal had a more consequential effect than the 4% shift of demand to services. Companies’ response to the crisis determine its duration and severity."
