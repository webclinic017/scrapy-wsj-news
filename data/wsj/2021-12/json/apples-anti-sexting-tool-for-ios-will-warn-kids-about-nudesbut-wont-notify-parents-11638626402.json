    "body": "Apple ’s  next iPhone update is set to include something child-safety advocates and parents have been asking for—a feature that warns U.S. users under 18 before they send or open text messages with nude photos.<br />But the company dropped a component of the tool that would notify parents when their children under 13 view or send nudes. That decision has won praise from some advocates, who say it protects the privacy of kids’ communications, and has rankled others who say it could leave kids vulnerable to predators and bullies."
