    "body": "Some of the more memorable new shows of 2021 weren’t really new—the footage Peter Jackson used in “The Beatles: Get Back,” for instance, was more than 50 years old. But the second season of “Never Have I Ever” and the third season of “Sex Education” were also among the best things on television this past year. They provided evidence that series could actually improve with age. They raised viewer hopes for 2022. Maybe Stanley Tucci will even go back to Italy?<br />At the risk of repeating 2020’s end-of-year refrain, there is too much on television right now for anyone to watch it all, or even keep track of. Years ago, a friend said, “You can have a very healthy movie life and never see anything that’s nominated for an Oscar,” which was absolutely true then—and something similar is true now about TV: We each live our own TV lives, lives that occasionally intersect but more often occupy their own quirky niches. I, for one, decided early on that life was too short for “Succession,” with its irredeemable characters who never went anywhere or did anything. Many others disagree. They think it’s a wonderful show. They’re also entitled to their opinions. And their personalized menus."
