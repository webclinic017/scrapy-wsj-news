    "body": "Graham Allison and Eric Schmidt argue forcefully for a national effort to preserve America’s technological leadership against a rising China (“China Will Soon Lead the U.S. in Tech,” op-ed, Dec. 8). But we need stronger medicine than they prescribe to “organize a national response analogous to the mobilization . . . that won World War II.”<br />Messrs. Allison and Schmidt cite the Innovation and Competition Act, which would spend $50 billion a year over five years on science and technology. The federal development budget fell to 0.3% of GDP last year from 0.8% in 1984. More than $100 billion a year of additional funding would be needed to restore the 1984 level."
