    "body": "President Biden last week celebrated a small decline in gasoline prices. Meantime, his Environmental Protection Agency proposed changes to the renewable fuel standard—aka the ethanol mandate—that will raise them.<br />The 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act requires gasoline sold in the U.S. to contain increasing volumes of renewable fuel. EPA assigns refiners and importers annual quotas they must blend into gasoline or diesel. Those that don’t meet their quotas must buy credits from others to comply."
