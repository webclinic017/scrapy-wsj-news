    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Federal Bureau of Investigation might have to eliminate a program that aims to track how often law-enforcement officers across the U.S. use force against citizens because too few agencies have submitted their statistics, according to a newly released government watchdog report.<br />Spurred by a series of high-profile police killings of Black people and minorities, the FBI in 2016 said it would build a first-ever national database to better collect information about deadly police encounters and other cases in which law-enforcement officers use force."
