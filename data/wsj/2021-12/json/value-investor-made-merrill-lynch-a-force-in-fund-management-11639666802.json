    "body": "As a student at City College of New York in the early 1950s, Arthur Zeikel had little ambition and no sense of what he might do with his life. Then an inspiring professor introduced him to economics and markets.<br />Mr. Zeikel discovered he was smarter than he thought and went on to earn an M.B.A. degree atÂ New York University and establish a reputation as a bright young Wall Street fund manager. Merrill Lynch hired him in 1976 and put him in charge of its tiny asset-management arm."
