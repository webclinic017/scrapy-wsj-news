    "body": "Financial stress at  China Evergrande Group  and a few of its peers won’t cause longer-term damage to the Hong Kong market, and broader problems with debt at Chinese property developers should be dealt with according to market principles, China’s top central banker said.<br />Hong Kong-listed Evergrande, which is one of China’s largest developers and has close to $20 billion in U.S. dollar bonds outstanding, didn’t make overdue payments on some bonds before a final deadline Monday, potentially setting the stage for Asia’s largest default. Fitch Ratings downgraded Evergrande and two key subsidiaries to a “restricted default” rating on Thursday, citing the missed coupon payments."
