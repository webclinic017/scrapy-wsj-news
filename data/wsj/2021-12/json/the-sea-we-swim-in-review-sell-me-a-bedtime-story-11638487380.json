    "body": "Amodern company should have values, a mission statement and a philosophy, but most of all it should be in the business of storytelling. So, at least, runs 21st-century wisdom. But what if your business has just leaked millions of gallons of oil into the sea? You’ll need a long-term “storytelling strategy,” according to “The Sea We Swim In: How Stories Work in a Data-Driven World” by Frank Rose, a veteran tech and media reporter who teaches a Columbia University seminar on the subject for executives.Arguably, however, in this case you don’t have a storytelling problem; you have an exploding-oil-rig problem.<br />The Deepwater Horizon example illustrates a tension between two ideas of “storytelling”: as a disingenuous Band-Aid, versus something more profound and sincere. Most of the time Mr. Rose adroitly distinguishes between the two, with flashes of sardonic humor. “Your product—your beer, your aftershave, your toothpaste—is not on a hero’s journey,” he writes, referring to the narrative model on which Star Wars was based."
