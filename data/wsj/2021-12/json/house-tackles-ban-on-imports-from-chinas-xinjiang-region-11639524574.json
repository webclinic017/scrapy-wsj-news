    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House plans to vote later Tuesday to ban imports from China’s Xinjiang region over concerns over the use of forced labor, after a bipartisan agreement was reached with the Senate on the language of the legislation.<br />The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act bans imports from Xinjiang over concerns over the use of forced labor. The compromise bill is expected to pass the Senate this week. Human-rights activists and some scholars say Chinese authorities have locked up a million or more Uyghurs and other minorities in internment camps as part of a ethnic-assimilation campaign."
