    "body": "Lockdowns and other harsh government measures don’t stop Covid, so why is the White House still trying to defend them? “Stronger COVID measures produce STRONGER ECONOMIC outcomes,” White House chief of staff Ron Klain tweeted Wednesday. “That’s why jobs, growth and economic activity are UP this year, significantly over last year.”<br />Egad.

But lockdown states continue to suffer high unemployment while Republican-led states that maintained many fewer restrictions have almost fully recovered."
