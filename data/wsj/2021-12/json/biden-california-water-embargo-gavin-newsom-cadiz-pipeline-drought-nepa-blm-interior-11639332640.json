    "body": "President Biden claims to love infrastructure. But note how his Administration is working to obstruct a desperately needed water project in California’s parched interior.<br />The Bureau of Land Management recently asked a federal court to vacate a permit the Trump Administration granted last year to Cadiz Inc. to repurpose a 220-mile mothballed oil and gas pipeline to transport water through California’s Inland Empire and Central Valley. Greens sued in March to block the Trump reassignment of the pipeline right-of-way to Cadiz, claiming it could be used to transport water from Cadiz’s water storage project in the Mojave Desert. Green radicals have been trying for 20 years to block the project but have lost in court."
