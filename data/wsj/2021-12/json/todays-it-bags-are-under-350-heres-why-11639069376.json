    "body": "IF ANY POP CULTURE phenomenon cemented the concept of the “It” Bag, it was the original, Y2K-era “Sex and the City.” There, in co-starring roles, were Dior’s Saddle Bag, Fendi’s Baguette, Gucci’s Belt Bag and Judith Leiber’s crystal clutch. And, of course, the Hermès Birkin, whose cameo introduced the masses to the concept of a bag that demanded not only a four-figure minimum outlay but a waiting period, much to the ire of Samantha (Kim Cattrall).<br />Luxury It Bags still exist—see the Dior Caro, the Givenchy Cut Out or the Bottega Veneta Point, the last of which can set you back nearly $5,000—but they’re now rivaled by a new wave of options from brands that value quality, design and affordability in equal measure. “A high price tag isn’t necessarily a determining factor of what is considered luxury anymore,” said New York fashion and culture writer and influencer Yaminah Mayo, citing as an example Telfar’s perpetually sold-out vegan leather Shopping Bag, all sizes of which cost less than $300. “Millennials and Gen Z are [reimagining] the framework of what makes something luxurious,” said Ms. Mayo, 29, calling out Luar and Edas as her favorite It Bag brands. Those “generations [don’t see] exclusivity as the absolute signifier for luxury.”"
