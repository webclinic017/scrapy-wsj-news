    "body": "Australia passed new rules that will make it easier to sanction accused human-rights abusers, becoming the latest U.S. ally to pass a law styled after the U.S. Magnitsky Act.<br />The U.S. Congress first passed the Magnitsky Act in 2012, naming it after Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer who died in a Moscow detention center in 2009 after accusing Russian government officials of corruption. Since then, Canada, the European Union and the U.K. have updated their sanctions rules to better target human-rights violators."
