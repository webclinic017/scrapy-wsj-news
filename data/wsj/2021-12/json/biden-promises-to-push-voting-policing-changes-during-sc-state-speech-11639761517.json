    "body": "President Biden said Friday during a commencement address at South Carolina State University that he would continue to work on getting legislation to overhaul policing and voting rules through Congress after both efforts stalled this year.<br />Democrats have made a renewed push this week for voting legislation. Bills passed by the House earlier this year haven’t advanced in the 50-50 Senate, where 60 votes are needed to move most legislation and Republicans are opposed, saying election laws should be left to states."
