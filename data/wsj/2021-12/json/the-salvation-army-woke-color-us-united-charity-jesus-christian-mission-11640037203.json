    "body": "A few months ago, my wife and I hosted Kenny Xu and one of his colleagues from Color Us United at our national headquarters for lunch. We shared some history, outlined the Salvation Army’s beliefs and described its commitment to service. Above all, we made clear that the Salvation Army has never been about politics. We are not on the left, and we are not on the right. We have always remained focused on one thing: to preach the gospel and serve people in the name of Christ. And that will never change.<br />Yet in “Wokeness Infiltrates the Salvation Army” (Houses of Worship, Dec. 17), Mr. Xu alleges that “an internal coalition of woke ideologues” endangers the army’s reputation. To substantiate this odd claim, he cites a few sentences from an internal discussion guide on racism that has subsequently been withdrawn. He never mentions that the guide was for voluntary use among our church members, and he dismisses the army’s efforts to promote internal discussion of diversity."
