    "body": "The financial-services company Nu Holdings hopes to raise as much as $2.6 billion in an initial public offering this week, with shares valued at between $8 and $9. That’s down from the more than $3 billion the Brazilian firm—incorporated in the Cayman Islands—had set its sights on earlier this year.<br />Still, Nubank, as the company is also known, boasts more than 48 million customers. As  Reuters reported last week, even after its amended filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company’s valuation could hit $41.5 billion, well above “Brazil’s largest traditional lender Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4.SA) which has a market capitalization of $37.5 billion.”"
