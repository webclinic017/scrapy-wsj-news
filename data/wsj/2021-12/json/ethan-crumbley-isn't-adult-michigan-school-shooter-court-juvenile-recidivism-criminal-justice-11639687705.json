    "body": "It’s difficult to summon sympathy for Ethan Crumbley, the high-school sophomore accused of shooting four of his classmates in Michigan. But everyone has an interest in equal justice under the law—a principle violated by a judge’s acquiescence to a prosecutor’s motion that he be charged as an adult. Mr. Crumbley joins tens of thousands of children shunted annually into a criminal-justice system for people over 18. Murdering four people is a horrific act. But it doesn’t transform a 15-year-old into an adult.<br />Americans have gotten tougher and meaner to our kids. Still, we continue to recognize that they’re kids. After 1899, when the first court for juveniles was established in Chicago, a separate legal system for children accused of crimes spread throughout all 50 states. Kids are believed to have less understanding of actions and their consequences; it therefore stands to reason that they should be judged less harshly. Because they are considered more responsive to efforts at reform, punishment is supposed to be set aside in favor of redemption. Research on the “teen brain” that shows that the prefrontal cortex—the part of the brain that governs impulse control, planning and consequences—isn’t fully developed until age 25 provides scientific support for treating younger defendants more leniently than adults."
