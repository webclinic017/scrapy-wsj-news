    "body": "AS A KID growing up in Detroit in the 1970s, Anna Sui knew she wanted to be a fashion designer. She was especially drawn to the colorful designs of Biba, a British brand influential in the ’60s and ’70s. At the London Biba boutique, her mom bought her a teal T-shirt with billowy sleeves along with matching eye shadow. “That was it for me. I’d never seen anything like Biba,” recalled Ms. Sui. “The makeup counter [at the London store] was art deco, decorated with plumes of black ostrich feathers. You were used to seeing blue eye shadow, but these were smoke and maroon and teal and plum, and the clothes were all the same colors with matching boots and matching hats.”<br />Having founded her eponymous label in 1981, Ms. Sui is one of the few independent designers still thriving in New York City, with an e-commerce fashion and beauty operation and bricks-and-mortar stores world-wide. As a gift for the holidays, in partnership with liquor brand St-Germain, she made a floral beaded bottle tote (pictured at her right in the portrait above). In her own experience, however, “I don’t think I would say the best [Christmas gifts] are material,” Ms. Sui said. “It’s more being with my family. I’m really close to them.”"
