    "body": "OCALA, Fla.—At a warehouse here in north central Florida, county elections supervisor Wesley Wilcox led some two dozen local business and community leaders around a cavernous room full of cordoned-off voting machines, stacks of paper to be turned into ballots, and rolls of “I Voted” stickers.<br />Mr. Wilcox encouraged the group to ask questions about everything from the security of mail ballots to the use of voting machines.
