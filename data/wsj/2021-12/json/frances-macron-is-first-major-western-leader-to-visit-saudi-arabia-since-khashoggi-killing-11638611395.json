    "body": "DUBAI—French President Emmanuel Macron traveled to Saudi Arabia on Saturday to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, making him the first major Western leader to go to the kingdom since the 2018 killing of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.<br />Mr. Macron’s visit, scheduled for four hours at a palace in the Red Sea coastal city of Jeddah, is a milestone for Prince Mohammed, who has struggled to repair the damage to his international standing since government agents killed and dismembered Mr. Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. A U.S. intelligence report determined that Prince Mohammed had ordered the operation, which Riyadh denied. The prince hasn’t returned to the U.S. or Europe since then and has been largely shunned by Western leaders."
