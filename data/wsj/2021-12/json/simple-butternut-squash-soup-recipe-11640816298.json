    "body": "SOUP SEASON is officially upon us. This one, chef Anne Quatrano’s second Slow Food Fast recipe, combines butternut squash with a little maple syrup and heavy cream, plus warming ginger and nutmeg. The garnish is a brown-butter streusel made with toasted oats and pumpkin seeds. “I love the crunchy texture against the velvety soup,” Ms. Quatrano said.<br />The recipe originated over a decade ago at Bacchanalia, the oldest of Ms. Quatrano’s Atlanta restaurants. “I’d say the throughline of all our places is our commitment to ingredients,” the chef said. “When we opened Bacchanalia in 1993 we started a farm, growing our own vegetables on 60 acres that had been in my family for decades.” They’re still at it, and at this time of year, the farm produces plenty of squash."
