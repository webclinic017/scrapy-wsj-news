    "body": "The staging of  Louis Vuitton ’s  spring 2022 men’s collection Tuesday on a barge off the Miami coastline was never going to be a muted affair. With over 1,000 RSVPs, a sunset call time and an Instagram-worthy skyline backdrop, it was envisioned as a marquee event of Art Basel, the art fair and dayslong party taking place in Florida this week.<br />But when Virgil Abloh, Louis Vuitton’s men’s artistic director since 2018, died Sunday following a private battle with cardiac angiosarcoma, the show was injected with a profound poignancy. As the 41-year-old Mr. Abloh’s penultimate show for the French luxury house, it became a communal celebration of a designer whose creative output encompassed everything from coveted logo hoodies under his own Off-White label to IKEA rugs to rap album covers."
