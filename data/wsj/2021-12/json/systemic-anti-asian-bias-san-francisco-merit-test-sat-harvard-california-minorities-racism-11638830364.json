    "body": "At the heart of critical race theory, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund says, is the idea that American racism is more than just “individual bias and prejudice.” It is “systemic,” because it is “embedded in laws, policies and institutions that uphold and reproduce racial inequities.”<br />Funny, but that sounds an awful lot like what Asian-Americans are experiencing these days, especially in education. They work hard to get into good schools—only to run up against an increasingly systemic orthodoxy on equity, which holds that Asian-Americans are taking more than their fair share. It helps explain why at Harvard Asian-Americans have both the highest average SAT scores and the lowest admissions rate of any racial group."
