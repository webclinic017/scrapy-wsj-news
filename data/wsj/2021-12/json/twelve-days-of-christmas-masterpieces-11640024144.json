    "body": "In almost every medium and in many eras and places, creative individuals have taken up the story of the Nativity and the infant Jesus as well as the holiday and the spirit it evokes. From the archives of our weekly Masterpiece column we have selected a dozen essays—one for each of the 12 days of Christmas—beginning with a 15th-century painting of the Annunciation and ending with a 20th-century movie whose story takes place on the Feast of the Epiphany.<br />“Nothing in the Bible story is more astounding than the pivotal instant when, quite suddenly, the Virgin Mary receives an unexpected visitor,” writes Richard Cork. That event, the Annunciation, has been popular among artists, who traditionally set the scene in Mary’s home. “But when Jan van Eyck took up the challenge, he broke through to a radical alternative,” says Mr. Cork. “Van Eyck was renowned as a pioneer of naturalism in the new medium of oil paint. And in a tall, narrow painting made about 1435, executed with mesmerizing precision and a wealth of meanings,” he relocated it from the Virgin’s home to the interior of a Gothic church. “By breaking away from the domestic context favored in so many other treatments of the subject, Van Eyck creates an image packed with coded messages about the triumph of the new faith over the old scriptures.”"
