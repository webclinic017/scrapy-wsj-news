    "body": "When the Roman writer Juvenal penned the adage “bread and circuses,” he warned emperors that they must conjure such distractions to pacify peasants into accepting lousy rulers. This should have President Biden worried—the price of bread in the U.S. has jumped 15% since the start of 2020, while a ticket to a modern-day circus, an NBA game, has climbed 37% since last season.<br />There’s real wisdom in the Roman cliché. Bread is a staple and its cost often reflects worldwide commodity prices. If it isn’t affordable, citizens throw fits and rocks. In 2007 hundreds of thousands from Mexico to Bangladesh to Italy rose in protest when prices of loaves, tortillas and pasta soared. But there’s another point of wisdom in the price of a circus. In our modern era, the cost of a night out doesn’t only say something about entertainment, but also the service sector—something to which the Federal Reserve and White House have not paid enough attention."
