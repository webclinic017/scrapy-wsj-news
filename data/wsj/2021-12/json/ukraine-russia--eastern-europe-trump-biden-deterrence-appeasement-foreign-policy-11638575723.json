    "body": "I commend the editorial board for its support of Ukrainian territorial sovereignty (“Deterring Putin in Ukraine,” Dec. 2). Russian President Vladimir Putin is probing to see how far he can revise Eastern European security arrangements before the U.S. and our European allies push back.<br />Reacting to the often erratic foreign policy of President Trump, many Americans saw in Joe Biden a seasoned figure from whom they could expect a serious, principled and internationalist foreign policy. Indeed, a prominent theme of his campaign was the rebuke of Mr. Trump’s Russia policy. This makes the foreign-policy errors that President Biden’s administration has committed over the past six months all the more dispiriting. Sadly, for many Democrats, it seems that Russian policy and aggression against my beloved Kyiv was important only when it pertained to domestic political arguments against Mr. Trump."
