    "body": "Macy’s Inc.  and  Kohl’s Corp.  have recently come under pressure from different investors to split off their e-commerce businesses. The activist push follows a decision by the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue in early 2021 to do just that.<br />The separation has allowed Saks to raise money to fuel its growth as e-commerce has surged during the Covid-19 pandemic. The valuations of other online retailers such as  Farfetch Ltd.  have exceeded those of more-traditional chains."
