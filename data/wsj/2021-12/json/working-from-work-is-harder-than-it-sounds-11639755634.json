    "body": "When Cara Dimitropolis started working from home nearly two years ago, she was constantly distracted by her chatty husband and the dog. These days, working from home is a welcome respite from the place she seems to have a hard time getting anything done: the office.<br />“Most people now want to sit and just chitchat with me for an hour,” said Ms. Dimitropolis, 30, who works in marketing for a real-estate company in East Longmeadow, Mass. “I’ll try and come in early and I won’t ever actually be alone. Somebody will come in and think I’m in here early just to talk and shoot the breeze for an extra hour.”"
