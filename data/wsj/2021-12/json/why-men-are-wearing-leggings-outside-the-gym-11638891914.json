    "body": "STICK AROUND in the fashion world long enough and you’ll see punchlines become true trends. The latest example? Men’s leggings. Once mocked as the leave-nothing-to-the-imagination sibling of skinny jeans, men’s leggings (or for the lexicologically efficient, meggings) have lately seen a boost in popularity. During Gucci’s November runway show, held on a closed-off strip of Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, several male models strutted in calf-clenching leggings. In recent years, stars like the Red Hot Chili Peppers singer Anthony Kiedis and Mickey Rourke have been spotted on stage and on coffee runs, respectively, in stretchy synthetic-blend tights. And emerging companies like Matador Meggings, based in New York and Miami, and Kapow Meggings, an Australian label, offer leggings designed with men’s bodies in mind.<br />Skintight men’s pants are nothing new. Scrutinize any renaissance painting and you’ll find stately subjects in garments that cling to their thighs. Macho matadors have long worn contoured tights, often with ornate embellishments along the sides. And myriad athletic pursuits—ballet, acrobatics, rhythmic gymnastics—call for leotards."
