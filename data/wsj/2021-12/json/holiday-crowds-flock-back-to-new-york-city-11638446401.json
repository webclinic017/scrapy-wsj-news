    "body": "The heart of New York City is once again bustling with holiday crowds a year after a spike in Covid-19 infections kept visitors away.<br />Foot traffic and sales over the Black Friday weekend met or exceeded pre-pandemic benchmarks set in 2019, retailers said. Many drivers of tourism that were canceled or reduced last year are operating at full strength. Broadway theaters, which reopened in June, were more than 80% full during Thanksgiving week. The Christmas Spectacular at Radio City Music Hall is running four shows a day, and a crowd gathered Wednesday evening as the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center was illuminated."
