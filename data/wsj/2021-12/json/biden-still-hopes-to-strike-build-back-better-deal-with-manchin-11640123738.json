    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden expressed optimism Tuesday that he could find a pathway to an agreement with Sen. Joe Manchin after the West Virginia Democrat rejected Democrats’ roughly $2 trillion education, healthcare and climate proposal.<br />“Some people think maybe I’m not Irish because I don’t hold a grudge,” Mr. Biden told reporters at the White House after laying out additional steps to combat the Covid-19 Omicron variant. “Look, I want to get things done. I think there’s a possibility of getting ‘Build Back Better’ done.”"
