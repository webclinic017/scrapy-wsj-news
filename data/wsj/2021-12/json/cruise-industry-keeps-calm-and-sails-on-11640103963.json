    "body": "If you wondered who would possibly board a cruise ship again after Covid-19 hit,  Carnival  Corp.  had some news for you Monday: 1.2 million guests have been aboard its ships since it resumed cruise operations in September of last year. And its forecast shows it intends to welcome millions more in the not-too-distant future.<br />The cruise giant issued a business update on Monday for the quarter ended Nov. 30. It held a number of positive data points for investors hopeful that the industry can continue to endure rough waters. Onboard revenue per passenger day was up 4% in the period relative to 2019 levels. That helped temper the companyâ€™s cash burn, which the company said came in better than expected. Carnival also said it is approaching 90% occupancy levels in the month of December with cumulative advanced bookings for the second half of 2022 and first half of 2023 at the higher end of historical ranges, and at higher prices compared with 2019 sailings."
