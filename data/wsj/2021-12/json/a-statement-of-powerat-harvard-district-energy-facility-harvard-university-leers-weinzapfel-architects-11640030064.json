    "body": "Cambridge, Mass.<br />Was Harvard happy about building a new gas-burning power plant? Would a vegan commune be happy about building an abattoir? But rather than playing down Harvard’s new District Energy Facility, its architects—Leers Weinzapfel Associates—have made it flashy, even exuberant. It does not apologize for burning fossil fuel but flaunts it with a sleek silvery pavilion wrapped in tapered fins. It is the architectural equivalent of an old political adage: If you can’t hide a weakness, hang a red flag on it."
