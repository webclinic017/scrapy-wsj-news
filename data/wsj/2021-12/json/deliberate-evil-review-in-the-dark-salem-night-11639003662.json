    "body": "The trials most often associated with Salem, Mass., took place in colonial America and resulted in the hangings of 19 women and men convicted of witchcraft. Almost 150 years later, Salem was again gripped by prosecutions and executions, but while the 17th-century witch trials remain infamous today, the events of 1830, which consumed the region at the time, have been largely forgotten.<br />In a slim, engaging volume, Edward J. Renehan Jr. chronicles the dark proceedings and argues that the explanation for their current obscurity is itself an interesting story. “Deliberate Evil: Nathaniel Hawthorne, Daniel Webster, and the 1830 Murder of a Salem Slave Trader” describes the brutal killing of 82-year-old Joseph White, its influence on writers including Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe, and the subsequent efforts of the families involved to erase the episode from historical memory."
