    "body": "More than a year after former Zappos.com Inc. Chief Executive Tony Hsieh died from injuries sustained in a mysterious fire, his family and friends are feuding over the entrepreneur’s estate including financial claims based on deals scribbled on sticky notes.<br />Mr. Hsieh, known for promoting happiness in the workplace and a fun-loving approach to making profits, died without a will at the age of 46. In the last year of his life, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, he struggled with alcohol and drug use and mental-health issues, people close to him have said. He surrounded himself with an entourage of people in his Park City, Utah, mansion, where the walls were covered with thousands of sticky notes detailing everything from life mantras to financial deals."
