    "body": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is threatening to withhold payments to healthcare facilities unless they require the Covid-19 vaccine for their workers. This action is misguided. I am vaccinated and support the goal of increasing vaccination rates. But the CMS policy has the potential to backfire and jeopardize patient access, safety and the quality of care for millions of Americans.<br />Medicare and Medicaid serve more than 140 million Americans and pump over $1 trillion into the U.S. economy. No healthcare entity can ignore CMS requirements without devastating financial implications. The CMS mandate will undoubtedly create patient safety and quality concerns, violating the purpose of the agency’s regulatory authority. It already is giving rise to legal challenges: On Monday a federal judge blocked enforcement of the mandate in 10 states that had sued over the requirement."
