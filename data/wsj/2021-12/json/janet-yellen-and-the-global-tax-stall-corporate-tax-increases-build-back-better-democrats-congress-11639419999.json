    "body": "Amid the debate surrounding the Biden Administration’s spending plans, it’s easy to forget that the Build Back Better bill comes with hundreds of billions of dollars in tax increases. Democrats promise that, at least on corporate taxes, other countries will raise theirs, too. So lawmakers should know what Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen isn’t telling them: Those global tax plans may yet stall out.<br />This will surprise anyone who took at face value a flurry of press releases in June and October hailing a major global tax deal. At issue are complex negotiations at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris to settle new rules for taxing large companies. Ms. Yellen broke a long bipartisan consensus in Washington by agreeing to these proposals, which include a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% and a new method for taxing the world’s 100 or so largest companies."
