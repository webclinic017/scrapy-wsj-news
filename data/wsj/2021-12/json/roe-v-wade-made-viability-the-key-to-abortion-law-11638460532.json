    "body": "On Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a case centering on a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks except “in medical emergencies or for severe fetal abnormality.” The case raises a crucial question: Can states ban abortion before the point, at roughly 23 weeks, when the fetus is “viable”—that is, able to survive outside the pregnant woman’s body? If the court answers yes, it could overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion until viability.<br />The Court first heard oral arguments in Roe 50 years ago, in December 1971. Brought by an anonymous plaintiff, the lawsuit contended that the Texas laws forbidding her from having an abortion were unconstitutional. A majority of the justices were inclined to agree. But Harry Blackmun, the justice assigned to write the majority opinion, was unsure where in the Constitution to ground the legal right to abortion and how late in the course of a pregnancy to grant it."
