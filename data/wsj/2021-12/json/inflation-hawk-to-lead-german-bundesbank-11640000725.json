    "body": "FRANKFURT—A longtime Bundesbank official with a record as an inflation hawk has been appointed as Germany’s new central-bank governor, just as the European Central Bank moves away from its ultra-easy-money policies amid a surge in eurozone inflation.<br />Joachim Nagel will replace Jens Weidmann, the hawkish German central-bank chief who made his name by attacking easy-money policies under former ECB President Mario Draghi. His tenure will start on Jan. 1. Mr. Weidmann announced his departure from the Bundesbank in October, five years before his term was due to end."
