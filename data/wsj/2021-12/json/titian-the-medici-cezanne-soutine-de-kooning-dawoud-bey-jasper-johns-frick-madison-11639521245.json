    "body": "<br />Among the most impressive in a season of impressive shows is “Titian: Women, Myth & Power” at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston, on view through Jan. 2, 2022. It reunites the six scenes of the loves, whims and vengeance of the gods—derived from Ovid’s “Metamorphoses,” enacted by voluptuous nudes—that Titian painted for Philip II of Spain between 1551 and 1562. Most exciting is the last of the series, the Gardner’s glorious, newly cleaned “Rape of Europa” (1559-62), the terrified heroine precariously sprawled on the back of Zeus, who is disguised as a white bull. Its radiant color, bravura gestures and delicate depiction are hallmarks of Titian’s vigorous late style. It has been 400 years since the now widely dispersed masterworks were last together. We won’t soon see them that way again."
