    "body": "Forget transitory. Inflation is now persistent, and very high. The Labor Department reported Friday that consumer prices in November rose 6.8% in the last 12 months, the most since 1982. This should be all the warning Democratic doubters need to shelve President Biden’s Build Back Better Act that could fuel more inflation.<br />Mr. Biden on Friday attributed the 39-year inflation high to car and energy prices, but this doesn’t wash. The price increases are broad-based, as they’ve been in recent months. Meat prices are up 16% over 12 months, furniture 11.8% and clothing 5%. Even the “core” index, which doesn’t include volatile food and energy prices, increased 4.9%."
