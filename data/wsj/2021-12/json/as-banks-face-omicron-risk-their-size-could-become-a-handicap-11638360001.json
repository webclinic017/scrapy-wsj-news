    "body": "Bank stocks have proven resilient during the pandemic. But as uncertainty over the Omicron Covid-19 variant coincides with a changing regulatory picture, that resilience is being tested anew.<br />Big lenders were among the hardest-hit stocks in the market’s intense reaction to the Omicron variant last week, with S&P 500 banks dropping nearly 4% on Friday, much more than the overall index.
