    "body": "Illinois lost one House seat in this year’s reapportionment, and Democrats blame snowbirds migrating south. But a new analysis by the University of Illinois Extension finds that those fleeing for better tax and economic climes include swarms of young people.<br />The Land of Lincoln is one of only three states, including West Virginia and Mississippi, to have lost population since 2010. But its population over age 55 has grown as Baby Boomers have aged. Over the last decade, Illinois’s median age has increased to 38.8 from 36.6, which puts it among the fastest aging states. Florida’s median age ticked up two years to 42.7."
