    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration has reached an agreement with Mexico to restart a controversial Trump-era immigration policy known as Remain in Mexico, officials said Thursday. It expects to begin sending migrants back to the country beginning on Monday while their asylum claims are considered.<br />The policy, formally called the Migrant Protection Protocols, was introduced by former President Donald Trump in 2019 at the height of a surge in Central American families coming to the U.S. border. After the policy was introduced, border crossings fell precipitously. But migrants sent back to Mexico faced a range of dangers, including assault, kidnapping and murder, according to reports from human-rights groups and internal reports produced by the Department of Homeland Security."
