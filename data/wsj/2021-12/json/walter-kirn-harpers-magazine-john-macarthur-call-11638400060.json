    "body": "John R. MacArthur’s account of why my contract was not renewed at Harper’s (Letters, Dec. 1) is news to me. I have only the very brief phone call from the managing editor, Ellen Rosenbush—in which Mr. MacArthur did not participate—to go on. As I said to the Journal’s interviewer (“The Weekend Interview With Walter Kirn” by Tunku Varadarajan, Nov. 27), no conversation was permitted in the call. Its tone was decidedly chilly and none of the issues with my performance that Mr. MacArthur brings up were mentioned. Also, in point of fact, I wrote only one column, not two, as he states, after the column that drew readers’ ire, as evidenced by several negative letters the magazine chose to publish.<br />Walter Kirn"
