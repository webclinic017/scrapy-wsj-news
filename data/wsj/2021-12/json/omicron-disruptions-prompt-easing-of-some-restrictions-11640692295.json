    "body": "Governments and policy advisers are showing signs of taking a lighter touch toward the fast-spreading Omicron variant, reducing quarantine times and in some instances foregoing social-distancing restrictions as they try to keep their economies moving.<br />The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday reduced the recommended isolation period for people infected with Covid-19 to five days from 10. The new guidance reflects growing evidence that people with the virus are most infectious one to two days before the onset of symptoms and two to three days afterward, the agency said, as well as concern over the disruption staff outages are causing in the travel and healthcare sectors."
