    "body": "DOES A WINE CLUB membership ensure access to carefully curated selections—or does it mean signing up to receive bottles that are mediocre or worse? The answer can be Yes on both counts.<br />There has been a great proliferation of wine clubs in recent years. Some were founded in response to the pandemic shutdown, when restaurant wine directors traded tableside selling for enticing buyers via subscription. They joined a field already crowded with clubs from retailers and importers, as well as companies with no wine connection at all. I recently spent time, money and quite a few hours tasting my way through the current crop; since most wine clubs offer the option of joining for a single month, I was able to try a range of offerings. (The Wall Street Journal’s business operations run a wine club, WSJwine, but it’s not connected to the news department or to me, and I did not sample it for this column.)"
