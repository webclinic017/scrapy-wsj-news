    "body": "Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin LLC is set to launch six people to the edge of space for a few minutes on Saturday, a trip that would round out the busiest year for human flights in more than three decades.<br />The company’s latest tourism flight has four paying customers on board: space-industry executive Dylan Taylor; Evan Dick, an investor; and investor Lane Bess and his child. Two guests who didn’t pay for their seats will be along for the ride as well: “Good Morning America” co-host Michael Strahan and Laura Shepard Churchley, the eldest daughter of Alan Shepard, who in 1961 became the first American to reach space."
