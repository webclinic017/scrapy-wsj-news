    "body": "Regarding your editorial on Columbia University’s labor dispute with its doctoral students (“United Auto Workers of the Ivy League,” Dec. 18): Earlier this month, we offered a package of compensation and benefits to Ph.D. students that is one of the most generous available at any U.S. university. It would provide $100 million in additional support to union members over the next five years, reflecting our determination to reach an agreement as soon as feasible.<br />Student loans do not play a role in Ph.D. packages. Columbia Ph.D. students pay no tuition and typically live in affordable, university-owned housing. In addition to stipends and compensation, we pay 100% of health-insurance premiums, including for dependents, and contribute to child care. All told, benefits, stipends and other compensation can reach $100,000 a year."
