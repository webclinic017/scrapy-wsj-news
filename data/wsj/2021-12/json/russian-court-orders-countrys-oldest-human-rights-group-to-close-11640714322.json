    "body": "A Russian judge dissolved one of the country’s oldest and most prestigious organizations dedicated to human rights on Tuesday, a move that government critics say furthers President Vladimir Putin’s assault on dissent.<br />The group, International Memorial, which was founded under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to research and shed light on the far-reaching abuses committed by the Soviet system against its citizens, has increasingly come under fire from Russian authorities who labeled it a foreign agent in 2016 for taking funding from abroad."
