    "body": "Here I am at Los Angeles International Airport, standing in line to board a flight to New York. Almost everyone in the area is glued to a cellphone, texting, emailing, posting and engaging in the other magical but mostly mindless activities. I’m not criticizing them, because I’m doing the same thing.<br />When I was a kid, my family had two rotary phones. Dialing was agonizingly slow—you stuck your finger into a round slot and moved it toward the stopper, then watched it slowly return to where it had started. They weren’t really portable because they were attached to outlets in the wall. Our rotaries were eventually replaced by the miraculous touch tone, equipped with a simple push-button dial and a longer receiver cord, which, depending on its length, allowed you to talk and walk short distances without destroying drywall."
