    "body": "Christmas came early this year for economic progressives with the publication Tuesday of a fat report on global inequality. It’s the product of a Parisian think tank founded by economist Thomas Piketty, and despite praise from the usual suspects it’s a turkey.<br />The big conclusion is that 2020 was a great time to be a billionaire. The World Inequality Lab’s “World Inequality Report”—you know where this is going—finds that the pandemic year saw the steepest increase on record in global billionaires’ share of global wealth. The top 0.01%, a club with some 520,000 members worldwide, saw their share of global wealth increase to 11% from about 10%. The world’s remaining billionaires saw their share grow to 3.5% of all wealth from about 2% before the pandemic."
