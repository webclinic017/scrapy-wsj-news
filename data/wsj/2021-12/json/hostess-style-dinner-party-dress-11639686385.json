    "body": "IN SEASON TWO of “Mad Men,” Betty Draper, played with rigid, mannequin-like perfection by January Jones, throws a global-cuisine-themed dinner party for associates of her husband, Don. The mood is as stiff as Betty’s early-1960s get-up: a polka-dot frock with a full skirt, modest hemline and taut bodice. Her hostess dress was a product of the times, but consider how much more comfortable she (and probably her guests) might have been had she worn a more forgiving silhouette.<br />Two years into a pandemic, vaccines have helped us slowly rebuild our social calendars. And with the holiday season upon us, there is a renewed desire to dress up. But because Covid endures, much of our socializing is done at home. “People are entertaining more and having [more] intimate gatherings,” said Sherri McMullen of her customers at McMullen Boutique in Oakland, Calif. Thus the hostess dress is seeing a revival, though its modern incarnation bears little resemblance to the prim frock Mrs. Draper wore to serve her guests gazpacho. Today, it’s about not just elegance but practicality. Telsha Anderson, owner of New York store T.a., says her customers are definitely hosting and attending more parties (where everyone is vaccinated). For those events, “they’re looking for functional, playful pieces,” she said."
