    "body": "The Omicron variant’s impact on global oil markets won’t be as seismic as initially feared, because governments and businesses are now better adapted to dealing with the coronavirus, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said Monday.<br />In its closely watched monthly report, OPEC left unchanged its global oil demand and supply forecasts for 2021 and 2022. However, the cartel said that some of the recovery in consumption that it had expected to take place in the final months of this year would shift into early 2022, due to the emergence of the highly-transmissible Omicron variant."
