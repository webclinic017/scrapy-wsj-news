    "body": "With the magnificent “A Christmas Carol,” “Oliver Twist” and other works, Charles Dickens exposed the plight of poor children as well as orphans. His many readers might think that Christmas was particularly dreary in 19th- and even 20th-century orphanages. My experience in an orphanage near Statesville, N.C., where I lived from age 10 to 18 in the 1950s, wasn’t at all like that.<br />Christmas at my orphanage began the week before Thanksgiving. All 225 girls and boys, ranging in age from 2 to 18, gathered in our cottages to write to Santa Claus. There were rules for those letters.  We could list three (and only three) suggestions for a gift that Santa would leave under our cottage tree on Christmas. Each gift could cost no more than $10 (or about $105 today), which we considered generous."
