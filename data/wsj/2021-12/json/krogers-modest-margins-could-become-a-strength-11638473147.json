    "body": "In the low-margin world of supermarkets, even small improvements in profitability aren’t so marginal.<br />Kroger  on Thursday reported better-than-expected results, with same-store sales increasing 3.1% from a year earlier in its fiscal third quarter ended Nov. 6, as consumers continued cooking from home. That was much better than the 0.9% increase Wall Street had been expecting. Shoppers also kept buying more premium products and fresh produce, with the fresh department seeing higher growth compared with the total store."
