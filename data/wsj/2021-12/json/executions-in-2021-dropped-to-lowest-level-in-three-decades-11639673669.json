    "body": "Executions in the U.S. dropped to their lowest level in more than three decades in 2021, as the death penalty continued its yearslong decline in both liberal and conservative swaths of the country.<br />Five states and the federal government have carried out 11 executions so far this year, down from 17 in 2020, according to a report released Thursday by the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit that studies the death penalty and is critical of how it is administered. Eighteen new people were sentenced to death, matching last yearâ€™s distinction as the fewest number of death sentences since 1972."
