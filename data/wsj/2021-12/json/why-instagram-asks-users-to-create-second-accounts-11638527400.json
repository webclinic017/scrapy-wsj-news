    "body": "Instagram has quietly rolled out a pop-up over the past year that encourages users to “try a new account.” The notice says it will help people “keep up with a smaller group of friends” and explore their interests more easily.<br />The pop-up confronts single-account users when they long-press the profile icon at the bottom of their feed, or tap their profile username. From there, with a few taps, they can make a second account without logging out of the existing one."
