    "body": "California officials have released a new set of congressional district maps that will result in more districts that analysts expect to be competitive, a contrast to most states that are reducing the number in which both major parties have a chance at victory.<br />The stateâ€™s independent redistricting commission approved the lines for 52 U.S. House of Representatives districts in a unanimous vote late Monday. Nine of them are competitive or have the potential to be competitive, according to political analysts, up from eight during the 2020 election cycle."
