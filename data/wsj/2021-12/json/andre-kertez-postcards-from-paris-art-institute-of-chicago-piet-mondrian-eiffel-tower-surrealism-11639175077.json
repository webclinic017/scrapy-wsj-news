    "body": "Chicago<br />‘André Kertész: Postcards From Paris” at the Art Institute of Chicago may be, inch-for-inch, the most exquisite photography show in America at the moment. An intensive perusal of the years 1925-28, right after the photographer moved to Paris from his native Hungary, it revisits a stupendously fertile period for the artist, one that gave birth to some of his most celebrated and diverse images, including the shadow-strewn “Chairs at the Medici Fountain, Jardin du Luxembourg”; the madcap “Satiric Dancer”; the serenely exacting “Chez Mondrian”; and the proto-minimalist “Fork.”"
