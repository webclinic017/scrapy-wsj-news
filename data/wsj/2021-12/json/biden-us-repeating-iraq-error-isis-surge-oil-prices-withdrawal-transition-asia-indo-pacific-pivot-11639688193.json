    "body": "The humiliating debacle in Afghanistan has many calling for a final U.S. withdrawal from the Middle East. Some are doves who fear another military intervention in the region. Others are hawks who want to shift U.S. attention to China. Both camps misunderstand the Middle East’s regional dynamics and its role in global affairs—the same mistake President Obama made 10 years ago during his “pivot to Asia.”<br />As the last U.S. soldier left Iraq on Dec. 18, 2011, the situation seemed stable. The Obama administration pitched withdrawal as the first step away from America’s long entanglement in the Middle East and toward greater engagement in Asia-Pacific. The idea was that diplomatic initiatives, regional trade deals and repositioned military assets would secure U.S. leadership in the fastest-growing and most dynamic region in the world."
