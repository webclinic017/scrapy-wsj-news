    "body": "Barack Obama embraced the art of the possible. Donald Trump wrote a book on the art of the deal. Joe Biden? Master of the art of the overreach.<br />Democrats are poised to shuffle out of town for the year, with not one of Mr. Biden’s remaining priorities in the bag. The party belatedly managed some routine business, avoiding a government shutdown and raising the debt limit. But the rest of that “transformative” Biden agenda is stalling. The president’s promises of major election-rule changes, a $15 minimum wage, new gun restrictions, a path to citizenship for 11 million illegal aliens—all are far from having the necessary Senate votes. His multitrillion-dollar reconciliation bill, the Build Back Better Act, remains mired in deep Democratic disagreements, likely punted to next year."
