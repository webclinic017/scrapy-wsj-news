    "body": "The U.S. economy grew at a “modest to moderate” pace this fall, with supply-chain issues and labor shortages holding back growth despite strong demand, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday.<br />The Fed report, a periodic collection of business anecdotes from around the country known as the Beige Book, found that consumer spending throughout the country was strong but held back by low inventories. Strong demand allowed firms to raise prices with “little pushback” from consumers, and increases were widespread throughout the economy."
