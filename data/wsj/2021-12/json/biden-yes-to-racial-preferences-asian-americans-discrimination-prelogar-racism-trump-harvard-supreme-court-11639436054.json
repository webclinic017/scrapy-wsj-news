    "body": "A week into his presidency, Joe Biden issued a memorandum declaring  “the Federal Government has a responsibility to prevent racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against everyone in America, including Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.”<br />Almost a year later, President Biden has now done an about-face. According to a brief by his solicitor general, Elizabeth Prelogar, the same federal government that Mr. Biden says should be fighting racism against Asian-Americans is OK with using race to discriminate against Asian-American college applicants. Even more significant, Ms. Prelogar’s brief urges the Supreme Court not to hear a lawsuit against Harvard University that seeks to have the use of race in college admissions declared unconstitutional."
