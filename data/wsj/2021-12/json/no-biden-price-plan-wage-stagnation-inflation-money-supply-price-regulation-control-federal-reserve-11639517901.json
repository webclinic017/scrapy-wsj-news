    "body": "Asked about his plan for a dangerous opponent, boxer Mike Tyson once said: “Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.” President Biden has proposed various plans to deal with inflation.<br />Prices rise when goods become scarce or the money supply expands rapidly.

After spending months dismissing inflation as transitory, the administration is now taking it seriously."
