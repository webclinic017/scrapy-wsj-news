    "body": "Those of us who came of age in Chicago loved the city for all reasons. From Daniel Burnham to the Daleys, Robert McCormick and all the industrial magnates who line the front of the Merchandise Mart, Chicago had much to admire. The architecture, the teams, the markets, the melting-pot culture. From the excesses of politics to the steady hand of industry, it was always the city that worked.<br />But now we may have reached a point at which radical individualism at the expense of community, and a victim mentality (read: critical race theory) fueled by public unions, have undermined the city’s ability to sustain itself. The failure of the Great Society of the ’60s may yet find its poster child in Chicago."
