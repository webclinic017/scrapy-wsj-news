    "body": "The Supreme Court heard oral argument last week in a technical case that could have major implications for American government. American Hospital Association v. Becerra involves Medicare drug reimbursement schedules to hospitals. It presents the Court with an opportunity to revisit its landmark 1984 decision in  Chevron  v. Natural Resources Defense Council, a major milestone in the rise of the administrative state. Chevron ushered in a perilous era of judicial deference to agency interpretations of laws deemed “ambiguous,” often by judges who think that no text is clear.<br />Chevron, like AHA, involved a technical challenge to an agency action. President Reagan’s Environmental Protection Agency had decided that the term “stationary source” in the Clean Air Act referred to an entire plant rather than to its individual smokestacks. That rule, which had reversed an earlier determination by the Carter administration, accommodated industry’s desire to modify individual components within the plant without triggering expensive and time-consuming permitting requirements for “new or modified” facilities under the act."
