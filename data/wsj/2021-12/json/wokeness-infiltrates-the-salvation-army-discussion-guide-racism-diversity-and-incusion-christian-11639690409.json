    "body": "Although the Salvation Army was founded in London in 1865, it’s in America that its Red Kettles have become a Christmas staple. The Salvationists have earned broad respect in American society after more than a century of charitable giving, but an internal coalition of woke ideologues now endangers the organization’s reputation.<br />This year the Salvation Army’s International Social Justice Commission published a discussion guide called “Let’s Talk About Racism.” The document, its authors say, was “designed to stimulate gracious discussion among Salvationists who choose to participate.” But its radical woke overtones against American Christians seem to make such gracious discussion impossible."
