    "body": "Now it can be said: Covid-19 isn’t going away. CNN’s Brian Stelter lectured his audience Sunday on “what living with Covid really means.” He cited “a highly transmissible variant” that has caused “many, many, many cases . . . here in New York City,” and said: “It seems that in some media circles this was the week that getting Covid became an inevitability.”<br />All the right people are coming down with what BuzzFeed’s Julia Reinstein dubbed the “media variant.” Suddenly getting Covid is cool. “You have about 12 hours left to get covid if you want to stay on trend,” tweeted Business Insider’s Jake Swearingen. “I don’t think this means shutting back down,” tweeted podcaster Lydia Polgreen. “I think it has to mean accepting that getting COVID is just a thing that’s going to happen to all of us, so behave accordingly (and get vaccinated).” Even President Biden is easing off, with his speech Tuesday stressing the importance of keeping schools and businesses open."
