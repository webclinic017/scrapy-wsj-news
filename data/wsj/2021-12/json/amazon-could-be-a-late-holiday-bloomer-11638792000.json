    "body": "Amazon . com hasn’t had the merriest of holiday seasons yet. But the e-commerce giant is in a better position than ever to help shoppers who didn’t get on the ball early.<br />Online shoppers spent about $33.9 billion during so-called Cyber Week—the period from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday—according to tracking from  Adobe .  That is down 1.4% from the same period last year. There isn’t a pattern of shoppers choosing bricks over clicks; the National Retail Federation reported that traffic to retail stores was down 3.4% from 2020 for the same period. Rather, more shoppers seem to have gotten out early. Adobe’s data showed total online spending up nearly 12% to $109.8 billion for the period of Nov. 1 to Nov. 29 compared with the same period last year."
