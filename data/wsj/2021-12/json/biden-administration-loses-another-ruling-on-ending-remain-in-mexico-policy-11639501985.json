    "body": "The Biden administration has suffered another legal setback in its bid to end a Trump-era immigration policy requiring U.S. asylum seekers at the southern border to remain in Mexico while their claims are considered.<br />The Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a ruling Monday night, said the Department of Homeland Security didn’t engage in reasoned decision-making when it ended the Trump policy in violation of a law that governs federal-agency actions. DHS didn’t take several elements into account, including the program’s potential benefits, the court said, adding that the agency’s approach was contrary to federal immigration law."
