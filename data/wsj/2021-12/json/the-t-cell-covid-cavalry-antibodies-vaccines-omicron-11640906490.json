    "body": "We hope this isn’t forbidden to report by the public-health pessimists, but there’s some good news about the vaccine defense against the Omicron variant. A pair of separate studies—from the Netherlands and South Africa—have found that T cells mobilized by vaccination reduce the severity of the disease.<br />The vaccines generate antibodies against Covid, but those defenses have been found to be less effective over time. T cells, a type of white blood cell, are a second line of defense that have held up better. The Dutch study found that while antibody responses fade against Omicron, the T cell response remains robust."
