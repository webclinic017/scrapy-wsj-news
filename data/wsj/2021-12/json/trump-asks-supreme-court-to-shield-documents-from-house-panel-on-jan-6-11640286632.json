    "body": "After two setbacks in the lower courts, former President Donald Trump on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to block the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 assault by Trump supporters on the U.S. Capitol from accessing presidential records from his time in office.<br />Attorneys representing Mr. Trump also asked the court for an emergency order stopping the Biden administration from turning over the records, which could happen in the coming days if the Supreme Court declines to act. Mr. Trump’s legal team said the issue of access to a former president’s confidential records raised serious concerns about separation of powers and executive privilege and urged the court to take up the matter."
