    "body": "The smartest thing Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot did with her lawsuit against the Fraternal Order of Police over its opposition to her Covid vaccine mandate was to drop it.<br />The mayor said last week she is dropping the suit because she’s now satisfied with the number of police getting vaccinated. As it happens, her decision also came after a judge stopped the city from firing members of the police union who don’t meet her Dec. 31 vaccination deadline. The judge said she must wait until the union’s arguments against her order go to arbitration."
