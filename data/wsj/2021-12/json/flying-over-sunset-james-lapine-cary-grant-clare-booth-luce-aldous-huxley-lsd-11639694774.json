    "body": "New York<br />As a boy, I didn’t know what to make of LSD. It was illegal, of course, and Sgt. Joe Friday assured me on “Dragnet” that taking it was the first step down a short road to psychotic hippiedom. Yet the radio was simultaneously full of trippy hit singles like the Byrds’ “Eight Miles High” and the Beatles’ “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds” that seductively begged to differ. Being the cautious type, I ended up steering clear of the stuff, but I wonder what I’d have done had I known that in 1958, a full decade before possession of LSD was criminalized in the U.S., Cary Grant took it every week under a psychiatrist’s care and thereafter swore by it, claiming that his hundred-odd trips effected a “beneficial cleansing” of his soul."
