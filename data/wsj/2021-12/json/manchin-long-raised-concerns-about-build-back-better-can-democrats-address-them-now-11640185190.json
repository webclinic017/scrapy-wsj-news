    "body": "WASHINGTON—For many Democrats, Sen. Joe Manchin’s decision to oppose a roughly $2 trillion healthcare, education and climate package this week was a betrayal that suddenly sank the party’s economic agenda.<br />For the West Virginia Democrat himself, the announcement was the latest in a consistent stream of criticism of President Biden’s signature agenda item. As a critical vote for Democrats in the 50-50 Senate, Mr. Manchin has repeatedly questioned how the spending could affect rising inflation and debt levels—concerns that he said other Democrats didn’t take seriously enough in the talks."
