    "body": "The U.S. government has made some bad assumptions about cyberspace over the past decade. The Obama administration, fearing escalation by U.S. adversaries, handcuffed U.S. military cyber operations by requiring executive approval for even small-scale cyberattacks. That reluctance to act meant that when Iran attacked the U.S. financial system or when North Korea attacked Sony Pictures, the administration had few options for retaliation. This restraint was most damaging on the eve of the 2016 election, when the Obama administration reportedly chose not to attack Russian networks despite knowing about disinformation operations from Russian cyber operatives. Some experts have suggested this was because of fears that Russia might escalate in response.<br />The Trump administration veered in the other direction, promising to “defend forward” and “persistently engage” without saying what actions the administration viewed as off-limits for itself and its adversaries. While public reports suggested that the administration conducted some limited offensive cyberattacks, certain senior officials suggested the U.S. wanted to do far more, and the  New York Times  reported that the U.S. even targeted the Russian power grid."
