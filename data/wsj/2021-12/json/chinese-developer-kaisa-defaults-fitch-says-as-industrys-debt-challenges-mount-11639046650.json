    "body": "Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. , which in 2015 became one of the first Chinese developers to default abroad, has defaulted again after not repaying a $400 million bond that came due this week, Fitch Ratings said.<br />Failures to repay investors are piling up in China’s property sector, as real-estate companies buckle under the strain of falling home sales, government curbs on borrowing, and a bond-market selloff that has all but shut the market for new deals."
