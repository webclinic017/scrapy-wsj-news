    "body": "More companies have been locking in long-term supplies of renewable energy in recent years as a way to cut greenhouse-gas emissions.

The company sources low-carbon power from utilities, nearby solar-and-wind farms and its own renewable-energy installations as it plans to get half its energy from renewables by 2025."
