    "body": "In “Justices Take Up Religious Liberty—Again” (Houses of Worship, Dec. 3), Michael Helfand and Nathan Diament correctly challenge the distinction between “status” and “use” that Maine is invoking to exclude schools that provide both secular and religious instruction from its private-school-tuition-assistance program. But the authors overlook one significant reason that the claim of the religious parents that Maine should pay for their children’s education is stronger than the claim by a Missouri church in Trinity Lutheran v. Comer (2017) for state support of the improvement of a rubber playground surface: Maine law requires parents to educate children between the ages of 6 and 17. The Supreme Court argument begins in this case, Carson v. Makin, on Wednesday.<br />Is it constitutional for a state to compel conduct but to treat differently those who comply fully with a statutory mandate while adding their religious observance? Jewish day schools that fully satisfy the education standards prescribed by local law while also providing religious instruction are penalized for their religious observance by the denial of tuition assistance."
