    "body": "Thirty years ago, on Dec. 25, 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. Mikhail Gorbachev stepped down as president, yielding to Boris Yeltsin, who raised the flag of the Russian federation over the Kremlin. Many Americans, then and now, concluded that U.S. policies had helped to destroy the “evil empire,” which was secondarily weakened by economic and military burdens as well as by national revolt in the republics.<br />And yet, three decades on, these widely believed explanations for the collapse of the Soviet Union are less persuasive. The cost of Soviet military commitments, for example, wasn’t insupportable in 1990: The U.S.S.R. withdrew from Afghanistan and Eastern Europe with its army in good order and still the largest in the world. Soviet military expenditures stood at 15% of GDP and were remarkably cost-effective compared with those of the West. Oil prices plummeted near the time of the collapse, but that shock wasn’t decisive, as Soviet oil and gas pipelines to Western Europe remained a crucial long-term asset. Soviet foreign debt stood at $65 billion in 1991, a big jump from a few years earlier, but Moscow had to pay only $3.9 billion in arrears."
