    "body": "Regarding Jelena McWilliams’s “A Hostile Takeover of the FDIC” (op-ed, Dec. 16): Elections have consequences. Politics is the process by which conflicting interests are resolved and the consequences of those elections can be implemented in an orderly and consistent manner. To provide a fair, transparent and predictable framework for the conduct of politics, we have established a scheme of laws, regulations and policies. This is particularly important for the regulation of banking, an industry critical to our economy, as it facilitates commerce through a payments system, allocation of capital and a reliable store-of-value mechanism. This system is founded on trust; trust by individuals, acting as corporations, investors or consumers, in the integrity of that system.<br />To achieve this, we have evolved a comprehensive body of law regulating the conduct of banking, and to ensure that banks operate within the constraints of this system, we have established a regime of bank regulators. Regulators expect banks and bankers to follow laws and sound banking practices. Conversely, bankers and the public expect regulators to abide by the regulations and policies that govern their behavior. It cuts both ways."
