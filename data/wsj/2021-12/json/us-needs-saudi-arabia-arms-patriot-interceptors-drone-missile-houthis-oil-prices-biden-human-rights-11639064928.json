    "body": "Saudi Arabia is begging the U.S. for Patriot interceptors to defend itself against drone and missile attacks from the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen. The Biden administration’s reluctance to provide them is wrong for three reasons. First, it endangers the Saudi people, who look to the U.S. for protection. Second, it endangers an ally and benefits Iran. Third, it is politically self-destructive for President Biden: It risks higher oil prices if missiles from Yemen hit Saudi oil fields.<br />Why would Mr. Biden deny an essential defensive capability to a long term ally? One Saudi theory is that he and his progressive allies are intent on punishing Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for his alleged role in the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Another is that Mr. Biden is so desperate to pass his Build Back Better legislation that he dare not risk a single vote by Democrats offended by Riyadh’s human-rights record. Either puts progressive virtue signaling ahead of statesmanship."
