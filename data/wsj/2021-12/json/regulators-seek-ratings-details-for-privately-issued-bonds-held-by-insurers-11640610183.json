    "body": "Insurers have been buying up privately issued bonds to earn higher yields in a low-interest rate world. Now, state regulators are demanding more information about these investments, which back many Americans’ life-insurance policies.<br />Starting in January, insurers will need to file details about the credit ratings for the privately issued bonds that they purchase. Regulators are concerned that the ratings potentially understate the risks of the securities."
