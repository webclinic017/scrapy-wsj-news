    "body": "A group of 12 American and Canadian hostages made a daring overnight escape last week in Haiti after being held in captivity for two months, walking for miles with children in tow over rough terrain full of brambles and thorn bushes, navigating by the stars and the view of a nearby mountain, a U.S.-based missionary group said on Monday.<br />The group’s description of events differs from versions given last week by Haitian police officials, who said the missionaries had been released and found by local residents. A spokesman for Haiti’s national police declined to comment on Monday."
