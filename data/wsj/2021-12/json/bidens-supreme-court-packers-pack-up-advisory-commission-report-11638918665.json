    "body": "President Biden’s Supreme Court advisory commission of 34 academics, lawyers and retired judges, which finished its work Tuesday, achieved its short-term political purpose. It gave Mr. Biden cover to avoid taking a position—at least during the 2020 presidential campaign and his first year in office—on whether or not to destroy the independence of the American judiciary by adding seats to the Court as the Democratic left is demanding.<br />But now that the commissioners (29 liberals and five conservatives) have voted unanimously to submit their inconclusive 294-page study to the White House, the President won’t be able to duck the question much longer. Demands for court-packing will intensify if Democrats are disappointed by the Justices’ rulings this spring. The good news is that the document, perhaps inadvertently, illustrates the bankruptcy of the court packers’ case."
