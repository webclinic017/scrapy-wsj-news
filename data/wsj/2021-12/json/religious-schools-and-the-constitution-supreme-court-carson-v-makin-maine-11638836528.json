    "body": "Maine has one of the country’s oldest educational choice systems, a tuition program for students who live in areas that don’t run schools of their own. Instead these families get to pick a school, and public funds go toward enrollment. Religious schools are excluded, however, and on Wednesday the Supreme Court will hear from parents who have closely read the First Amendment.<br />If Carson v. Makin sounds familiar, that’s because last year the Justices ruled on a similar dispute in Espinoza v. Montana Dept. of Revenue. The parents won that one, as the Court put up another strong ruling on religious freedom. “A State need not subsidize private education,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for a 5-4 majority. “But once a State decides to do so, it cannot disqualify some private schools solely because they are religious.”"
