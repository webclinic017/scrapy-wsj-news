    "body": "BRUSSELS—European Union leaders are set to warn Russia on Thursday that it would pay a high cost for carrying out a fresh military intervention in Ukraine, but they will likely sidestep a call from Ukraine’s president to detail the actions they would take to deter the Kremlin.<br />EU leaders gathered in Brussels discussed the situation on Ukraine’s border on Thursday afternoon after NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg earlier urged Russia to reverse a buildup of troops, artillery, tanks and drones close to Ukraine that “undermines security in Europe.”"
