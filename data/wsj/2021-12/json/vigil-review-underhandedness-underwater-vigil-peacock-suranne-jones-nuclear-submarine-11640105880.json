    "body": "There’s a boatload of plotlines in “Vigil,” one of the better thriller series of the year and one in which a tangled web of intrigues is made as believable as the fathomless ability of humans to complicate a situation—at least long enough to last a satisfying six episodes. There are subplots aplenty. And submarines.<br />There’s also a fishing trawler, whose highly dramatic demise may have some thinking of “Jaws”: Despite its desperate effort to escape whatever’s snagged on its net cable, the boat is dragged inexorably backward, its cable smoking, its engines straining, until the stern is pulled into the Scottish brine and the boat is on its way to the seabed. Likewise, we presume, the men on board. “We have to go up and help,” pleads Burke (Martin Compston), a crewman aboard the Royal Navy submarine Vigil, which we have been led to suspect has snared the trawler and dragged it under. Burke is rebuffed—the Vigil, part of the U.K.’s Trident nuclear deterrent, has bigger fish to fry, as well as problems that its officers don’t want to surface."
