    "body": "The pandemic has led to many abuses by government, and thank heavens for the courts. On Monday a Massachusetts judge overturned Boston’s rental eviction moratorium and rebuked the city’s public health commission for its gross “overreach of power.”<br />After the Supreme Court overturned the federal eviction moratorium in August, Boston’s acting mayor, Kim Janey, ordered a new local ban. Under Massachusetts law, landlords who prevail in court must hire a licensed constable to carry out the eviction. The Boston Public Health Commission’s order thwarted the enforcement of court-ordered evictions by barring landlords and constables from following through on the legal process."
