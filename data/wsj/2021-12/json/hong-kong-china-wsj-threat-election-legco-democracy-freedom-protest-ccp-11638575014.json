    "body": "I regret that your editorial “Hong Kong Says Vote—or Else” (Nov. 30) contains baseless assumptions. The Legislative Council election, originally due to be held in Hong Kong on Sept. 6, 2020, was postponed for one year owing to the public-health risk posed by Covid-19, not because of the result of the district council election. With the pandemic effectively contained, the election has now been scheduled to take place on Dec. 19, as promised.<br />To suggest that “Hong Kongers risk harsh penalties if they protest in public” is not only incorrect but also scaremongering. Hong Kong’s Basic Law and National Security Law stipulate that rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech, the press, publication, association, assembly and demonstration, shall be protected. But any manipulation to sabotage an election will not be tolerated. It is perfectly in line with international practice for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government to take enforcement action against lawbreakers who attempt to sabotage elections."
