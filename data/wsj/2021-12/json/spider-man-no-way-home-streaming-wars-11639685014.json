    "body": "The streaming war requires some big guns–even for those who’ve chosen to sit it out.<br />The new Spider-Man movie swinging into theaters this week is nearly as big as they come. Theater chains Cinemark and  AMC Entertainment  both reported that advance ticket sales for “Spider-Man: No Way Home” have been second only to 2019’s “Avengers: Endgame”—now the second highest-grossing movie of all time. Current projections have the new movie ultimately grossing about $450 million in domestic box office, according to Alicia Reese of Wedbush. That would have been considered a very strong performance even before the global pandemic that hobbled the movie-theater market."
