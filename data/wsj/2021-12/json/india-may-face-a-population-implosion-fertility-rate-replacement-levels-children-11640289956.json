    "body": "India has long been a byword for overpopulation, but this is about to change. According to a new national survey, India’s total fertility rate, the average number of children a woman will bear during her lifetime, has fallen to 2—below the replacement level of 2.1 for the first time.<br />This does not mean that India’s population of 1.4 billion has begun to decline—yet. The country’s youthful demographics (the median age is 28) mean India will continue to grow until the middle of the century, when the population is expected to peak at 1.6 billion."
