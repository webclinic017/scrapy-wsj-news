    "body": "Henry Ford and Thomas Alva Edison were the twin wizards of the first decades of the 20th century in America. They were paragons of industrial ingenuity and wealth—Ford was the richest man in the country, Edison the paramount inventor—even more renowned than their latter-day counterparts, Elon Musk and the late Steve Jobs. Ford and Edison—accompanied by Harvey Firestone, the tire mogul, and a retinue of servants—would take “camping trips” by car each summer to promote auto sales (and themselves) that were covered by reporters as big news. And in the early 1920s, they collaborated for a time in one of the oddest episodes in the saga of American enterprise.<br />The story of this pair’s vain effort to build a utopian garden city powered by a mammoth hydroelectric dam at Muscle Shoals, Ala., is all but forgotten. Now it’s been disinterred by Thomas Hager, in “Electric City: The Lost History of Ford and Edison’s American Utopia,” a well-researched, crisply written account tinged with irony."
