    "body": "BERLIN— Volkswagen AG  CEO Herbert Diess is likely to survive his latest clash with labor representatives over the pace of the company’s transformation to an electric-vehicle maker after weeks of negotiations produced a compromise that would strip the outspoken executive of some of his duties, people familiar with the talks said Monday.<br />Mr. Diess has been under fire for weeks since warning the company’s board of directors in the fall that unless VW greatly accelerated its shift to electric vehicles it could lose up to 30,000 jobs at its main operations in Wolfsburg, Germany, around half of the workforce at the plant."
