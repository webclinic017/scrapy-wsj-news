    "body": "The yuan has soared to multiyear highs against the dollar and other major currencies, reflecting strong demand for China’s exports and its financial assets, and prompting some pushback from the country’s central bank.<br />The surge is unusual because it comes while the dollar is also gaining ground. That contrasts with a previous rally in 2018, which partly reflected broader weakness in the U.S. currency."
