    "body": "David Rivkin Jr. and Lee Casey are right that another debt-ceiling cliffhanger should be avoided, and that a constitutionally dubious suspension of the debt limit is not the answer (“This Debt-Ceiling Fight Threatens Democracy as Well as Solvency,” op-ed, Dec. 7). A smarter way for Senate Republicans to address the issue is to pass an entirely different sort of debt-limit bill, one that pays for obligations already enacted but limits the future share of that debt that could be financed by the Federal Reserve.<br />The Federal Reserve Banks’ stockpile of publicly held Treasury IOUs exploded from $476.3 billion in the third quarter of 2008 to $5.91 trillion in this year’s third quarter—that is, from 7.5% to 25.3% of GDP. In the same period, the federal debt grew from 67.3% of GDP to 122.6% of GDP. It seems doubtful that it would have been so easy for Congress to have let the debt grow twice as fast as the economy had it not been able to count on such an accommodating central bank."
