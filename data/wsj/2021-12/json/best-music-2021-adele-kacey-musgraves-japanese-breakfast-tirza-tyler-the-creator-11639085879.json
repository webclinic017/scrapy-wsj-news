    "body": "<br />In 2020, people were using music to cope—an uptick in streaming numbers for new age and ambient artists suggested listeners turned to soothing sounds to comfort them through the worry and isolation that accompanied Covid-19 lockdowns. In 2021, by contrast many of the best albums dealt with how to move on from hardship while exploring questions about relationships, personal identity and the lines between public and private selves. It was a time for serious and solemn music, with inwardly focused songs that used the language of psychology. None of these LPs are about the pandemic per se, but all are reflective and tinged with loss while celebrating survival."
