    "body": "KNOWN AS A Southern chef and the owner of four Atlanta restaurants—not to mention a veteran of San Francisco’s Zuni Café—Anne Quatrano has, over the years, also found culinary inspiration in New England, on Nantucket. ”Most of my industry friends, I met on the island. I visit a few times a year. I have to see the water,” she said.<br />At Ms. Quatrano’s restaurants, she carefully sources the ingredients; almost everything comes from local producers.
