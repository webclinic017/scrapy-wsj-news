    "body": "Afghanistan’s former President Ashraf Ghani said in his first broadcast interview since fleeing Kabul that he escaped abroad because his security detail had told him that it couldn’t defend him. He added that he also sought to prevent the Afghan capital from becoming a battleground between rival Taliban factions.<br />American officials, from President Biden down, as well as other leaders of the fallen Afghan republic, have pointed to Mr. Ghani’s flight on Aug. 15 as the reason the Afghan state suddenly collapsed and diplomatic efforts for a peaceful transition imploded."
