    "body": "WASHINGTON—Congress is poised to create a new corporate minimum tax, and pension advocates, renewable-energy backers and manufacturers are pushing for changes before the plan is finalized.<br />The tax is aimed at companies, such as Amazon.com Inc., that report large profits to shareholders but—legally—pay relatively little in taxes. It would impose a minimum 15% federal tax rate on many companies with at least $1 billion in profits, based on the income reported to investors."
