    "body": "As inflation reaches its highest point in nearly 40 years, Americans are spending more to feed their families, fill their gasoline tanks and buy the products they need. So why are antitrust-reform advocates determined to raise prices even higher? While news coverage is preoccupied with “Big Tech,” a group of antitrust activists are pushing to bring back old ideas that will exacerbate inflation in healthcare, groceries, consumer products and beyond.<br />Antitrust laws protect competition. Competition benefits society—and consumers—by spurring innovation, improving quality and lowering prices. Companies and industries rise and fall, but the competitive process ensures that American consumers benefit. That is why antitrust focuses on whether a merger or other business conduct harms consumers. Yet some argue for jettisoning “consumer welfare”—the lodestar of U.S. antitrust laws—to promote other interests like protecting less efficient competitors and organized labor and reducing income inequality."
