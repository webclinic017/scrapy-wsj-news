    "body": "Dozens of  Starbucks Corp.  workers in the Buffalo, N.Y., area are set to conclude voting Wednesday on whether to organize, potentially adding another union to a city that has been a longtime labor stronghold.<br />Since workers at three area Starbucks cafes petitioned in August to unionize, workers and labor organizers have been handing out yard signs and pins. Meanwhile, executives at the coffee giant have pushed back, hosting meetings with employees and sending texts to vote “no” on a union. The campaign has put a national spotlight on the city of roughly 278,000, with prominent lawmakers such as Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez commending the workers’ efforts."
