    "body": "Nestlé S.A.  has agreed to reduce its stake in L’Oréal SA in a $10 billion deal that allows the world’s biggest packaged-foods maker to capitalize on a rally in the French beauty giant’s share price.<br />The maker of Nescafé coffee and Purina petfood said it would sell 22.26 million L’Oréal shares back to the French company, paring its stake to about 20% from 23%. Nestlé will use the proceeds to help fund its own 20 billion Swiss francs, approximately $21.6 billion, share-buyback program."
