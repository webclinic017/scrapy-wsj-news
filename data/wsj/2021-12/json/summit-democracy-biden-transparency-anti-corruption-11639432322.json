    "body": "Critics of the Summit for Democracy (“At the Democracy Summit, Biden Bungles Again” by Sadanand Dhume, East Is East, Dec. 10) focus on who was invited, like at a wedding, where a snub may trigger a family feud. Pakistan was in, Hungary was out. Why? Don’t know, won’t defend. I will suggest that what happened at the summit is more important.<br />With authoritarianism on the rise, a global gathering focused on democracy was timely and necessary. Fighting global corruption was appropriately on the agenda. The administration announced, during a weeklong rollout of initiatives, proposals to stem the abuse of our financial system by corrupt actors. A draft rule to address money laundering through anonymous corporations puts us a step closer to implementing the bipartisan Corporate Transparency Act. Drug cartels, rogue nations and terrorist networks use these opaque entities to steal, launder and benefit from illicit proceeds."
