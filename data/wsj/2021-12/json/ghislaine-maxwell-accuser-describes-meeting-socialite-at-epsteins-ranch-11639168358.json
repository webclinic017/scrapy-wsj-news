    "body": "A fourth accuser took the stand at Ghislaine Maxwell’s sex-trafficking trial Friday, testifying that when she was 16 years old, the British socialite touched her breasts during a massage at Jeffrey Epstein’s New Mexico ranch.<br />Annie Farmer said in federal court in New York that in the spring of 1996 she went on a weekend trip to the ranch with Ms. Maxwell and Epstein after he had expressed an interest in her education and in helping her get into college. But the trip left her feeling isolated and confused, she said. During the getaway, Epstein caressed her arm while they watched a movie and tried to cuddle in bed with her one morning, she said."
