    "body": "Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett will meet Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan on Monday in the first official trip to the United Arab Emirates by an Israeli leader since the countries established diplomatic ties.<br />The meeting is set to take place during negotiations between world powers and Iran to constrain Tehran’s expanding nuclear program. Israel and the U.A.E. aren’t part of the negotiations, but Mr. Bennett’s government has raised alarms about the direction of the talks and Sheikh Mohammed has sought to counter Iranian influence throughout the region."
