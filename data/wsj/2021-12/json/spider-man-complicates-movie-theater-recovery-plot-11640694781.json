    "body": "It is too bad  Sony  can’t make a new Spider-Man movie every weekend.<br />The webslinger’s latest outing—“Spider-Man: No Way Home”—has now grossed more than $467 million domestically and topped $1 billion world-wide at the box office since its Dec. 17 release. That makes it the biggest hit of the pandemic period by far, with the movie selling more than twice as many tickets as the next runner-up,  Disney ’s  “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” according to the box-office tracking site The Numbers. That level of business would qualify the movie as a hit even pre-pandemic; only 45 other movies in history have topped the $1 billion mark globally."
