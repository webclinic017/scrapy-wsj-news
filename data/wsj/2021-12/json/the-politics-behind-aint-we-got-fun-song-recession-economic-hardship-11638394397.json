    "body": "Most pop songs are sincere confessions of love sought, lost or acquired. Yet every decade seems to spawn one or two humorous novelty blockbusters. A nascent radio star in 1947, Arthur Godfrey scored big with “Too Fat Polka.” In 1969 Ray Stevens spun a jaunty, guitar-playing King of the Jungle into “Gitarzan” gold. When “The Treasures of Tutankhamun” exhibition toured the world, Steve Martin cashed in with “King Tut,” which he performed in 1978 on “Saturday Night Live” in culturally appropriating faux-Egyptian regalia.<br />Rarer still is the political novelty song. Harvard mathematician Tom Lehrer penned sardonic Cold War admonitions—“So Long, Mom (I’m Off to Drop the Bomb)” and “We Will All Go Together When We Go.” And one such hit, 101 years ago, proved to have staying power."
