    "body": "Talks to revive the Iran nuclear deal stalled on Friday, with Western allies warning the effort was a step closer to collapse after Tehran’s negotiators barely inched from their stance over a week of negotiations.<br />Western diplomats said Iran’s new negotiating team, joining talks for the first time since hard-line Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi took office in August, ramped up their conditions for a return to the deal while eschewing many of the compromises that Tehran had agreed to during the first six rounds of talks from April to June to restrain its future nuclear work."
