    "body": "In addition to the concerns you address in “The Supreme Court’s Covid Vaccine Test” (Review & Outlook, Dec. 21), it is alarming that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit gave little attention to the conscience of religious organizations and employees in lifting the stay on Covid vaccine mandates. In a mere footnote of a nearly 40-page opinion, Judge Jane Branstetter Stranch brushed aside such legitimate and Constitutionally protected concerns as “premature.”<br />The president should not be able to issue an edict through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and take over all companies with over 100 employees and the healthcare decisions of their employees. But the religious-liberty harm makes that abuse even worse. The Supreme Court should not reward President Biden’s abuse of federal regulation to bully religious organizations and people of faith into submission."
