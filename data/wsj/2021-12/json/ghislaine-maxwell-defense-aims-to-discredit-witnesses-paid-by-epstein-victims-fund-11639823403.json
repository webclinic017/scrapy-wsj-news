    "body": "Lawyers for Ghislaine Maxwell are highlighting a fund that awarded nearly $125 million to Jeffrey Epstein’s victims as part of their effort to discredit four accusers who testified at trial.<br />All four accusers who testified for the prosecution at Ms. Maxwell’s trial said they had received awards from the fund, ranging from $1.5 million to $5 million. The Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program, which was created after the financier’s death, ended its claims process earlier this year after paying about 150 of Epstein’s accusers with money from his estate."
