    "body": "The arbiter of Senate rules found that Democrats’ plan to provide temporary protections for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally can’t be passed as a component of party lawmakers’ roughly $2 trillion education, healthcare and climate package.<br />The guidance provided by Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough is set to force Democrats to remove the protections from the bill, the third time the party’s immigration proposals have been found to run afoul of the chamber’s rules. The current provisions would have shielded immigrants from deportation for five years and would have provided a five-year renewable work authorization, available to any immigrant who arrived in the country before 2011."
