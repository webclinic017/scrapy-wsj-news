    "body": "The U.S. Air Force discharged 27 airmen for refusing to get a coronavirus vaccine, the Pentagon said Monday. They are among the first active duty service members to be removed for not meeting the mandate.<br />The airmen, who were administratively discharged as of Friday, didn’t apply for a religious or medical exemption, but instead said they wouldn’t get the vaccine, the Air Force said. The roughly 326,000 active duty members of the Air and Space Force were told in September that they had to be fully vaccinated by Nov. 2."
