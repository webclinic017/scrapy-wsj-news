    "body": "WHAT TO DO with a fireplace that’s purely decorative or is sitting idle in the offseason? It’s unfortunately a perfect place to house a cliché—birch logs, five fat candles, that inane books-turned-bindings-in trick. Jesse Carrier, of New York’s Carrier and Company, is more optimistic: “The fireplace is an architectural focal point in a room, a wonderful stage to set with accessories and mementos that tell your story.” He and other interior designers shared fresh ideas for sparking a room’s black hole, whether a fireplace that doesn’t work at all or one that’s just enjoying the summer off.<br />“I think it is essential to find ways to bring light into a nonworking fireplace,” said New York designer Phillip Thomas. His choice of illumination: “logs” of Selenite, a mineral that forms in large, lustrous translucent crystals. They capture light and create a lovely glow, he said, “almost making it feel like there’s a fire lit.”"
