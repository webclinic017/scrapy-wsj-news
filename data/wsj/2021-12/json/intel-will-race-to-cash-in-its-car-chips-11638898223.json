    "body": "Intel  Corp.  knows when it has a hot hand, but not how long it will last.<br />The chip maker announced plans late Monday to take its Mobileye business public. Intel is aiming for an initial public offering of the unit in mid-2022 and believes it can land a valuation of around $50 billion, according to reporting by The Wall Street Journal. Intel would retain majority ownership of Mobileye, which would be run by the self-driving-car unit’s current management team and include the recently acquired Moovit business as well as other Intel teams working on technology related to autonomous driving."
