    "body": "The Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday proposed fixes to prevent engine coverings from breaking apart on certain  Boeing Co.  777 aircraft, as they did in a series of incidents including on a United Airlines jet over Colorado earlier this year.<br />The proposed changes, which would allow the aircraft to return to service, are aimed at strengthening engine covers to prevent plane parts from detaching midair and striking aircraft or falling to the ground."
