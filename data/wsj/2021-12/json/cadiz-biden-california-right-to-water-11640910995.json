    "body": "I write to offer our vociferous support of your position in “Biden’s California Water Embargo” (Review & Outlook, Dec. 17), crying foul about federal efforts to obstruct a desperately needed water project. Readers should know how politics can threaten our human right to water.<br />The Cadiz water project will serve drought-stricken Californians by improving water access in underserved communities and creating nearly 6,000 jobs. California’s Fourth District Court of Appeal upheld six lower-court decisions validating the project, which adheres to the state’s strict environmental laws."
