    "body": "The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the nation, is expected to decelerate for the year ended in October, but still remain historically elevated. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimate that the 20-city Case-Shiller index rose by 18.6% in the year ended in October, down from the 19.1% annual rate the month prior.<br />A limited supply of homes coupled with robust home-buying demand has contributed to some buyers being pushed out of the marketâ€”a trend that has persisted throughout the year in hot real-estate markets like Phoenix and Austin, Texas."
