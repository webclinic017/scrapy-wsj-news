    "body": "Shaynna Sims was haunted by the fact that her husband had been having an affair. So when his lover died in 2015, Ms. Sims went to a viewing at the Tulsa, Okla., funeral home. There she mutilated the woman’s body, which prosecutors later said had both breasts “crudely cut off.” She also took graphic pictures, including one with her wedding ring “prominently displayed.” Ms. Sims received 16 years in prison in 2017, but last month she was freed.<br />Add this to the toll from the Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in McGirt v. Oklahoma. In that case Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by the Court’s liberals, held that Congress never formally dissolved the Creek Nation’s historical reservation. The same logic has been extended to five other tribes. As a result, the state’s authority to prosecute crimes involving Native American perpetrators and victims has vanished in nearly half of Oklahoma."
