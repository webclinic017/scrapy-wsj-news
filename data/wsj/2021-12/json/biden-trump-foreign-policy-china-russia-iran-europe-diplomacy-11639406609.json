    "body": "The editorial board is right to point out that U.S. strategy under President Biden is unbalanced (“Rogues Are on the March,” Dec. 6). There are those who believe diplomacy is the way to peace. That makes sense in the cases of the U.S., the European Union, Japan, and so forth. But it is deeply mistaken when it comes to China, Russia, Iran and others.<br />Our adversaries take diplomacy and concessions as signs of weakness to be pocketed and abused. It’s hard power that they understand. Showing up to a negotiation without it, far from promoting peace, is likely to provoke them to war."
