    "body": "TOKYO—Global investors including Warren Buffett have identified Japan as a market packed with undervalued companies. But a recent case in which management used a poison pill to stop an aggressive share buyer—with the Supreme Court’s endorsement—shows why newcomers have a tough time unlocking Tokyo’s opportunities.<br />The case involves the company that built Japan’s first domestically made rotary printing press in 1906.
