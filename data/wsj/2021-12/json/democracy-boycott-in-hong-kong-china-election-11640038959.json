    "body": "What if they held an election and almost nobody came? That’s what happened Sunday in Hong Kong, where voters stayed home in record numbers in silent protest of the sham poll in which democratic candidates were blocked from running.<br />The Legislative Council vote was the first since Beijing imposed sweeping new election rules on Hong Kong. All candidates now must pledge fealty to Beijing and receive the Communist Party’s approval. Pro-democracy stalwarts were disqualified from holding office, driven into exile, or imprisoned."
