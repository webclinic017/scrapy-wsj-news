    "body": "After a gravity-defying 2020, hydrogen stocks have drifted back toward Earth this year. Investor expectations are now better pitched for a sector offering huge growth prospects but on a still-uncertain, subsidy-dependent time scale.<br />Many shares associated with “green hydrogen,” which is made by splitting water using renewable energy, have more than halved from their early-year peaks. The explanation lies mainly in last year’s wild rally. Over two and three years, stocks such as British electrolyzer maker  ITM Power  and Canadian fuel-cell specialist  Ballard Power Systems  are still up strongly."
