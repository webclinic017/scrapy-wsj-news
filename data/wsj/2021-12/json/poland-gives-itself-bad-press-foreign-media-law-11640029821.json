    "body": "Protests erupted around Poland this weekend over a new law tightening restrictions on foreign ownership of media. The Polish government thinks it is treated unfairly by foreign critics, but then it hurts itself with this media law.<br />The bill passed Friday would prevent firms with majority ownership outside the European Economic Area from obtaining Polish broadcast licenses. The obvious target is TVN, an independent broadcaster owned by the U.S. conglomerate Discovery through a Dutch-registered company. TVN24, the news arm of TVN, often reports critically on the ruling Law and Justice Party."
