    "body": "It’s a good time to be a chip maker. Any kind of chip maker.<br />GlobalFoundries  has been a hot property since going public in late October. The stock had risen 47% from its listing price ahead of the company’s third-quarter report late Tuesday. That made the company one of the most richly valued in the semiconductor space at nearly 78 times forward earnings—a notable premium for a chip maker that stepped out of the race to make the most-advanced processors a few years back.  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ,  which dominates contract chip manufacturing, trades at less than one-third that multiple."
