    "body": "Between factory shutdowns in Vietnam, supply-chain snags and a cotton-price surge, apparel sellers look stretched thin heading into 2022. Off-price retailers such as TJX Companies,  Ross Stores  and  Burlington  are poised to make a timely entrance, though.<br />Next year might be challenging for clothing sellers precisely because 2021 was such a banner yearâ€”both for sales and profitability. Demand was strong as consumers, armed with stimulus dollars and emboldened by vaccines, showed a healthy appetite for new clothes after a full year of lounging in pajamas and sweatpants. Through October, U.S. clothing and accessory stores have raked in almost 11% more revenue than in 2019, according to Census Bureau data. That is a remarkable expansion for an industry that eked out less than 1% growth in 2019. Retailers also were able to expand margins as a lack of inventory helped them to avoid discounts. Year to date, the S&P 500 subindex of apparel companies actually outpaced two of the three off-price retail giants."
