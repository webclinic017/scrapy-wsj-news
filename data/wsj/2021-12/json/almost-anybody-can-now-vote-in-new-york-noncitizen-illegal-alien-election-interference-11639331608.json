    "body": "The New York City Council approved a bill last week to let about 800,000 noncitizens vote in local elections, and Mayor Bill de Blasio has said he won’t veto it. The measure passed 33-14, over some strong dissents, including from Democrats.<br />“It’s unconstitutional under state law. It’s very clear,” said Councilman Kalman Yeger, a Brooklyn Democrat, during Thursday’s debate. That was seconded by Councilman James Gennaro, a Queens Democrat. “I and everyone in this body took an oath—an oath!—to uphold the constitution of the state of New York.”"
