    "body": "Didi’s detour to New York was bumpy and short. Its journey back  toward Hong Kong won’t be any smoother. But the direction of travel—not only for it, but also for most of its large Chinese peers—is clear. The era of large-scale Chinese listings in the U.S. for any company with remotely sensitive data is over.<br />The Chinese ride-hailing giant said Thursday that it plans to delist its shares in New York, less than six months after its $4.4 billion initial public offering, and seek a listing in Hong Kong instead. The unusual move is clearly aimed at placating Chinese regulators, which blocked the company’s China business from adding new users shortly after Didi went public. The company went ahead with its IPO despite regulators’ suggestion that it should delay due to data-security concerns. Shares of Didi have almost halved from its IPO price."
