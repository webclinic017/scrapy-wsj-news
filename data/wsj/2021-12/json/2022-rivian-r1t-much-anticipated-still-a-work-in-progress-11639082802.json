    "body": "LAST SATURDAY, at the local Cars & Coffee, a gentleman stepped out of the crowd surrounding my borrowed Rivian R1T electric pickup to convey his skepticism. He didn’t like that electric cars were being “jammed down people’s throats,” he said.<br />Whoa, Nelly. Ford has nearly 200,000 reservations for Ford F-150 Lightning, excluding fleet; Tesla is reported to have more than a million reservations for Cybertruck; and Rivian—a Silicon Valley startup with manufacturing in Normal, Ill., that went public in November—has enough orders to keep them busy for the next two years. The consumer demand is real."
