    "body": "YOU MIGHT SAY Hugh Johnson is to wine books as  Apple  is to iPhones: Both produce annual updates to something that’s pocket-size. But Mr. Johnson, with 44 pocket wine books to his name, holds a significant numerical edge.<br />Published in October, “Hugh Johnson’s Pocket Wine Book 2022” is the 45th and latest edition, and also the first where he relinquishes the author credit: This time it goes to Margaret Rand, his longtime editor. Mr. Johnson’s name is still on the cover, too, since—as he put it—“Hugh Johnson” is no longer merely an author but also a brand. With almost 12 million pocket wine guides sold to date, the characterization seems apt."
