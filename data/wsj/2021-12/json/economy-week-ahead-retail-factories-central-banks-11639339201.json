    "body": "The Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting, which wraps up Wednesday, is the highlight of this week’s economic calendar.<br />China’s consumption and investment might have been dented by the recent resurgence of Covid-19 infections and the nation’s property slump, while factory production likely picked up thanks to falling commodity prices and easing power shortages. Retail sales, a key gauge of consumer spending, are forecast to grow 4.5% from a year earlier in November, slowing from 4.9% in October, according to economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. Fixed-asset investment is expected to increase 5.2% in the first 11 months of the year, decelerating from a 6.1% increase recorded in the first 10 months. Industrial output likely rose 3.7% on year in November, speeding up from 3.5% in October."
