    "body": "IN OCTOBER, as I booked my first trip back to London—my first trip anywhere—in two years, I felt the old thrill. With the airline seat map on my computer screen, I felt the titillation, the exhilaration of travel, the rush of just going! While I tried to nab an aisle seat, the sound of Sinatra singing “Come Fly With Me” poured from my home speakers.<br />A few weeks later, I was on the plane. As I reached my seat, I heard my name. Just across that aisle seat were Susan and David Schwartz, a couple of New Yorkers I hadn’t seen since before Covid, and then we were hugging and saying, “Of all the gin joints…” Middle-aged travelers jumping up and down, quoting lines from “Casablanca,” might piss off the starchy flight attendants, but who cares? We were going to London!"
