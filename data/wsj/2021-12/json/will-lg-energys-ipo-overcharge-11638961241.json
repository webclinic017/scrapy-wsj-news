    "body": "The world’s second-largest electric-vehicle battery maker,  LG Chem -owned  LG  Energy, is hoping a separate listing will give the business a little more spark.<br />Given the incredible investor interest in EVs right now, the company’s mammoth IPO will probably unlock substantial value for its parent company, and also help finance the enormous capital expenditures needed to keep up with rising demand. New investors may benefit too—as long as the company can avoid further missteps like the Chevy Bolt battery recall."
