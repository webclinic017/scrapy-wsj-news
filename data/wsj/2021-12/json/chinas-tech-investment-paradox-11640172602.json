    "body": "China’s economy is struggling right now, but one thing not lacking is foreign investment. Keeping that up may help China offset the drag from a slower growing property sector in the future. Foreign direct investment, especially in manufacturing, comes with lots of ancillary benefits, like technology, and is often closely related to export competitiveness.<br />The headline numbers are impressive. As most of the world gingerly picks itself up during the pandemic, foreign direct investment in China for the first 11 months of the year was $157 billion. That figure is up 21% and 26% respectively from the same periods in 2020 and 2019. Investment in high-tech industries was up 19% from 2020, according to state media."
