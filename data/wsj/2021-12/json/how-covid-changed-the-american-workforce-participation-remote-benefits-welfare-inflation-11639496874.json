    "body": "Economic forecasting is a tricky business—at best, an art rather than a science—and even the best observers get it wrong sometimes, as the Federal Reserve Board has this year with inflation. Disjunctive events, such as a pandemic, make predictions even more difficult.<br />No doubt the pandemic has accelerated changes that were already under way. (The shift toward remote work is a good example.) But there is also mounting evidence that the pandemic is triggering changes that wouldn’t have happened otherwise."
