    "body": "America’s population grew 0.1% this year, the lowest rate on record, according to Census Bureau figures released Tuesday that show how the pandemic is changing the country’s demographic contours.<br />The U.S. added just 393,000 people in the year that ended July 1 for a total population of 331.9 million. That included 148,000 more births than deaths, a surplus that has long supplied much of the nation’s growth. The other component, which measures movement into and out of the country, grew by 245,000. It was the first year in which growth from births exceeding deaths fell below net arrivals from abroad, according to the bureau."
