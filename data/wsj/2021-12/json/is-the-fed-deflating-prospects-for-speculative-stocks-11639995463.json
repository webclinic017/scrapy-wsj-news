    "body": "Speculation seems to be going out of fashion. Since early November, the most speculative stocks have been crushed, even as the wider market reached new highs. Many blame the Federal Reserve, but the link between monetary policy and speculation is less clear than it seems.<br />Among those losing 20% or more: The “meme” stocks of  GameStop  and  AMC Entertainment ,  electric-car maker Tesla, hydrogen darling  Plug Power ,  bitcoin and a host of tiny unprofitable stocks. The businesses have little in common, but all rely for high valuations on buyers willing to bet on a story—and have benefited from the surge in individuals trading stocks. (A stunning rally in some of the speculative names Friday did little to mitigate the losses; AMC led with a 19% daily gain, but is still down one third from early November, and worth just over half where it peaked in June.)"
