    "body": "TO ALL THE COOKIES I’ve loved before, that traveled in and out my door during the pandemic (and there have been many): I’m glad they came along, but I’d dedicate a song to baker Rick Easton’s collection of Italian cookies. I keep returning to this assortment of not-very-sweet biscuits from Mr. Easton’s bakery, Bread and Salt, in Jersey City, N.J. Each one is distinguished by a single salient ingredient or two—the bitter almond of the soft amaretti morbidi, the sesame seeds of the crunchy reginelle made with lard “for a little more of that Palermo bakery taste,” the shop’s description reads.<br />They appeal to me as someone who loves to bake but doesn’t love a fussy production. Italian cookies typically contain no more ingredients than you can count on one hand. And though you’ll find baroquely adorned sweets at Italy’s pasticcerie, the majority of that nation’s biscotti (the generic word for cookies) are quite plain in appearance."
