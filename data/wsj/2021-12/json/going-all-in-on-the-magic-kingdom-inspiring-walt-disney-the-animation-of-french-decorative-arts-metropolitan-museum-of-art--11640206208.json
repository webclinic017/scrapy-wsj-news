    "body": "New York<br />‘The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s first exhibition about Hollywood dream maker  Walt Disney  is a landmark event,” writes the museum’s director, Max Hollein, in the foreword to the catalog of “Inspiring Walt Disney: The Animation of French Decorative Arts.” It is—and not in a good way. The show, which pairs 18th-century European decorative arts objects with Disney-related materials in an effort to show the influence of one on the other, breaks with the museum’s storied past and sets it on the path to an unworthy future."
