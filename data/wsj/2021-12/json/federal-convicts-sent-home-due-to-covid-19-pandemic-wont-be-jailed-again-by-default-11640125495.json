    "body": "WASHINGTON—Thousands of federal convicts released to home confinement to reduce the spread of the coronavirus won’t be required by law to be returned to prison once the official state of emergency for the pandemic ends, the Justice Department said Tuesday, reversing an earlier opinion that would have potentially sent them back en masse.<br />Instead, according to the new determination, the federal Bureau of Prisons can use its discretion in deciding whether some offenders can remain at home once the state of emergency is lifted, which isn’t expected anytime soon given the rise in new infections caused by the Omicron variant."
