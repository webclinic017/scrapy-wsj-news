    "body": "We were dismayed by the conduct described in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chairman Jelena McWilliam’s op-ed “A Hostile Takeover of the FDIC” (Dec. 16). But we were not surprised. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Rohit Chopra was our fellow federal trade commissioner from 2018 to 2021, and the FDIC boardroom shenanigans that Ms. McWilliams describes are reminiscent of his conduct at the Federal Trade Commission.<br />Mr. Chopra’s routine public denigration of terrific FTC staff, his disregard for bipartisan norms and traditions, and his willingness to distort both law and fact eroded the tradition of bipartisan engagement in a way that even Democrats lamented. It undermined the credibility and integrity of the agency, its mission and its initiatives."
