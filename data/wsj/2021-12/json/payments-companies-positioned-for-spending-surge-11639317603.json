    "body": "Omicron might have slowed some people’s plans to travel or make other big purchases, but payments stocks are a way to bet that they haven’t been permanently put aside.<br />Shares of companies that often track with spending via cards have roared back after recent weakness. Stocks such as  American Express Co. , Capital One Financial Corp.,  Fiserv Inc.,   Mastercard Inc.  and  Visa Inc.  are all up more than twice as much as the overall market’s roughly 3% gain so far in December."
