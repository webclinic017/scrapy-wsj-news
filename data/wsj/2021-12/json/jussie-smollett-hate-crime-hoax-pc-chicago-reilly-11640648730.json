    "body": "Jussie Smollett’s tale was always far-fetched. The actor initially claimed to have been attacked at 2 a.m. on the coldest day of the year by two Trump-supporting white guys who were walking through center-city Chicago wearing MAGA hats and carrying a rope noose and a full bottle of bleach. These conservatives recognized Mr. Smollett from “Empire,” the hip-hop musical TV series, and opened a street fight with him by declaring Chicago “MAGA country!” Bizarre.<br />Yet, as Holman Jenkins, Jr., writes in “Jussie Smollett’s Enablers Weren’t His Friends” (Business World, Dec. 18), leading left-wing figures could not be seen “hinting even slightly that there was anything fishy.” Joe Biden tweeted: “We are with you, Jussie.” Vice President Kamala Harris said Mr. Smollett is “one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know” and “the attempted victim of a modern-day lynching.”"
