    "body": "EVER SINCE the late 1960s, when leather ski boots were consigned to oblivion by the arrival of plastic shells that offered better control, alpine skiers have paid a price. Between runs, plastic ski boots left them teetering along icy walkways—their ankles immobilized—on treacherously smooth, hard soles.<br />So when lifelong skier Deirdre O’Mara learned of boots that combined the best features of a flexible boot for backcountry skiing—in which skiers climb up ungroomed mountains and then ski down them again—with a burly alpine model, she snapped up the first pair she could find. For the former product designer who skis at resorts and heli-skis in Alaska, the hybrid Dalbello Lupos were a good fit. “I wanted a resort-weight alpine boot, but also a walk mode for standing, walking, or just relaxing at lunch,” the 48-year-old said. Her new boots’ high-grip soles also supplied better traction on slippery surfaces."
