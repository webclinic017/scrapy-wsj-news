    "body": "As the authors of a recent article on the effect of prolonged educational disruption on children and adolescents, we’d like to emphasize the critical warning from Dr. Leslie Bienen in her op-ed “School Closures Aren’t Just for Covid Anymore” (Nov. 29).<br />Our publication documented evidence for measurable negative effects of Covid-era school closures on learning, physical health and mental health, most significantly for already-marginalized students. There are data to support serious concerns about potential long-term ramifications of such disruption, which may be magnified by the apparent absence of any cohesive and targeted national learning recovery plan."
