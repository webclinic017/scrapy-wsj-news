    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration on Wednesday urged the Supreme Court to turn away a challenge to Harvard College’s race-conscious admissions policies and leave in place decades of precedent permitting affirmative action to promote diversity in higher education.<br />U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, the administration’s lawyer at the high court, said in a legal brief that lower courts were correct in siding with Harvard, and she argued there was no good reason for the Supreme Court to revisit its past rulings allowing the use of race as a factor in college admissions."
