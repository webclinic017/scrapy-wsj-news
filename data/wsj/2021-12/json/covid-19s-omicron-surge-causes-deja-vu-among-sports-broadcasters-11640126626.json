    "body": "The latest surge in coronavirus cases among professional athletes is once again forcing television networks to rearrange their schedules on the fly.<br />TNT, a unit of  AT&T Inc.’s  WarnerMedia, was slated to air a National Basketball Association game between the Washington Wizards and Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday. But because the Nets have too many players sidelined due to the virus, the game was postponed, and TNT has decided to show the Indiana Pacers’ game with the Miami Heat instead."
