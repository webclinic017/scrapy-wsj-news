    "body": "It was edifying to read Colleen Sheehan’s “Breaking News From 1795: Jane Austen Falls in Love” (Nov. 26). Yet the op-ed left one thinking that Tom Lefroy, Austen’s suspected love, was simply a callow upper-class youth lost to history after his dalliance with Austen. Not so. Thomas Langlois Lefroy (1776-1869) was a noted Irish barrister and a member of the British Parliament. He was appointed to the Privy Council for Ireland and presided for 14 years as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. Austen’s niece, Anna Austen, married Benjamin Lefroy. Their daughter married Justice Lefroy’s nephew, also named Tom. It is through these connections that much proof of the romance between Jane Austen and Tom Lefroy comes down to us today.<br />Judge John Curry"
