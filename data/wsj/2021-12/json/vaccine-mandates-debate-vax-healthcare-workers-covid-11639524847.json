    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Biden’s Vaccine Mandate Wipeout” (Dec. 10): I want my healthcare providers to be vaccinated for two reasons. First, we in the medical profession have an obligation not to spread disease to our patients, and because of our exposure to sick people, we have a much higher risk of acquiring infection and infecting others.<br />Second, only by insisting on vaccination against Covid can we help ensure that during peak infection loads healthcare personnel remain well and able to care for sick people."
