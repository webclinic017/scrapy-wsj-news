    "body": "Turkey’s currency tumbled against the dollar Wednesday, a setback to the government’s experimental plan to stabilize the currency.<br />The lira fell more than 6% against the greenback, undoing part of the currency’s significant comeback since last week, when Turkey’s government said it would guarantee returns on certain lira bank deposit accounts at a rate similar to those on foreign currency. The plan was aimed at stopping a brutal currency meltdown."
