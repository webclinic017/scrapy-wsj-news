    "body": "AUSTIN, Texas—When Time magazine last week named Elon Musk “Person of the Year,” it painted a spartan picture of his living arrangements. “The richest man in the world does not own a house,” the piece began.<br />The magazine was repeating what has become a core element of Mr. Musk’s public persona. Since last year, when the billionaire  Tesla Inc.  and SpaceX CEO announced he was “selling almost all physical possessions” in an effort to simplify his life, Mr. Musk has repeatedly portrayed himself as a man of modest tastes."
