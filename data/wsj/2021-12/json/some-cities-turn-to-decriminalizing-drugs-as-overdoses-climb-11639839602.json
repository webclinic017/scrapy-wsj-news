    "body": "TORONTO—Canada’s largest city is the latest jurisdiction aiming to decriminalize drug possession as it faces a surging overdose epidemic.<br />Toronto’s board of health this month said it would seek permission from Canada’s federal government to allow drug users to carry small amounts of drugs for personal use, including heroin, fentanyl and cocaine, without fear of prosecution.
