    "body": "One of Chinaâ€™s largest managers of quant funds is languishing after a rare bout of underperformance in recent months, which led to an unusual public apology from the firm this week.<br />High-Flyer Quant, a six-year-old firm started by a trio of young computer scientists who were university classmates, uses artificial-intelligence technology to pick domestic yuan-denominated stocks, design trading algorithms and hedge investment risks. It recently had the equivalent of $9.4 billion in assets under management, according to its website. The firm grew rapidly by producing returns that in some cases were 20 to 50 percentage points more than stock-market benchmarks in the last few years, according to a pitch it sent to clients."
