    "body": "Kellogg Co. said it has reached a new tentative agreement on a five-year contract with about 1,400 workers who have been on strike at four plants where Frosted Flakes, Froot Loops and other consumer brands are made.<br />The workers have been on strike for more than two months, demanding better pay and enhanced benefits after working longer hours during the Covid-19 pandemic. Workers were also upset over a two-tiered system of pay in which newer employees are paid less than veteran employees, and have to pay more for health insurance."
