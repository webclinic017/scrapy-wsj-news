    "body": "The Chinese yuan has been a surprise winner in 2021, making steady gains against the dollar even as China’s economy has been faltering. That is unlikely to last.<br />There have been a few key factors propping up the yuan. First and foremost has been China’s exceptionally strong trade surplus. A huge, pandemic-related shift in Western demand to goods over services has massively favored China, still the world’s factory floor even after years of trade tensions. What is more, Covid-19 breakouts elsewhere have frequently shut down production and port activity in rival exporting nations such as Vietnam, increasing the world’s reliance on Chinese manufacturing. Finally, China’s own heavy hand against Covid-19 at home has kept domestic consumption suppressed, putting a lid on imports."
