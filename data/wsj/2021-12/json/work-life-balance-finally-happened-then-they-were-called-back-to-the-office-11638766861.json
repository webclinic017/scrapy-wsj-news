    "body": "Ashlee Shoup had been craving a better balance between her work and her life. And for six months, she actually got it.<br />The 25-year-old in Virginia Beach, Va., switched from an in-person job as a manager for a financial-services company to a remote role with a life-insurance firm in January 2021, taking a $20,000 pay cut for the privilege of flexibility. Instead of a two-hour long commute to drop off her infant son with family before heading to work, she went on a morning walk with him. Instead of scrolling her phone during her lunch break, she prepped dinner. She felt relieved, efficient at everything, as if she finally had a life outside of work."
