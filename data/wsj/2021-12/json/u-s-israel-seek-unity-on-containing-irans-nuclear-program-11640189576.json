    "body": "TEL AVIV—President Biden’s national security adviser met Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett as the two allies sought to present a more united front on Iran’s nuclear program after divisions emerged between the U.S. and Israel.<br />Israeli officials say they have pushed the U.S. to take a more forceful approach to Tehran if talks in Vienna break down, and they are openly planning for a military strike on Iran. The Biden administration is taking a more cautious stand and views economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure as better options than a military attack."
