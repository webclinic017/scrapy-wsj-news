    "body": "Under the U.S. Constitution, federal judges are picked by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate. Judges don’t pick their own successors. But some judges might need a refresher on this provision of the Constitution.<br />The Biden administration recently lost an opportunity to appoint a new judge to the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Robert King of West Virginia rescinded his decision to take senior status (a form of semiretirement that creates a vacancy on the bench). Judge King, 81, had announced in August that he would step aside on confirmation of his successor, but last month he told the White House in a letter that he had changed his mind."
