    "body": "The Federal Reserve has retired the word “transitory” and now admits that inflation is high, but it isn’t in any rush to do much about it. That was the message Wednesday from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and Chairman Jerome Powell, whose actions said inflation really is transitory, even if it’s now impolitic for them to say so.<br />As a rhetorical matter, the FOMC statement shifted notably from its long-time wording and chucked its language that it would aim to have inflation run well above its 2% target. Mr. Powell waxed enthusiastic about the “rapidly” improving labor market and the economy—”really strong,” “consumer demand is very strong,” “incomes are very strong.” In that limited sense at least, he was mugged by economic reality."
