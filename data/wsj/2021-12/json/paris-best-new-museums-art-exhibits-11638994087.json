    "body": "AS CULTURAL CAPITALS go Paris has, for centuries, run ahead of the pack. That record—stymied during one of Europe’s longest Covid-19 lockdowns—makes the current explosion of artistic attractions on view now extra gratifying. Two new museums have recently opened while one of the city’s oldest has emerged from a four-year face-lift.<br />Among the must-see exhibitions is “The Morozov Collection: Icons of Modern Art,” on view until Feb. 22 at the Fondation Louis Vuitton. The exhibit features 200 works amassed by the Morosov brothers, Muscovites who at the turn of the 20th century began buying Monets, Gauguins, Van Goghs and Bonnards along with works by Russian painters, only to see their collections nationalized by the Soviets in 1918 and later dispersed into state museums. Many of the masterpieces are being shown outside Russia for the first time."
