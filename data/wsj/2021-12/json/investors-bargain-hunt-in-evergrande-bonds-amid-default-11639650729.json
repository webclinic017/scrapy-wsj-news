    "body": "Some money managers purchased bonds of China Evergrande Group in recent weeks as the property developer toppled into default and prices hit record lows.<br />Fund managers are betting creditors will recover far more than the debt’s current prices suggest, despite the likelihood of a complex restructuring. The real-estate company has $20 billion of international bonds outstanding, making it one of the world’s largest distressed-debt investments at the same time low interest rates have investors looking for ways to boost returns."
