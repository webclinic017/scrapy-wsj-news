    "body": "Didi investors have finally gotten a clear glimpse into its financials following the Chinese ride-hailing giant’s fateful run-in with Beijing. It isn’t a pretty picture.<br />The company said Wednesday that its revenue for the three months ending in September declined 11% from the previous quarter: its first earning report since the firm’s initial public offering in New York in June. Didi went public against regulators’ warnings, triggering a cybersecurity probe that resulted in many of its apps being taken off app stores. The company has lost nearly two-thirds of its market value since its IPO, hitting another new low this week."
