    "body": "About midway through “New York’s Finest,” Michael Daly tells a story that may strike a chord with New Yorkers—or, more likely, former New Yorkers—of a certain age. It’s about a run-of-the-mill shooting, nothing like the horrific crimes Mr. Daly portrays elsewhere in his paean to the New York Police Department. But it took place in a seemingly safe space: a Vera Wang bridal shop on Manhattan’s Upper East Side in early 1994. Two men robbed an out-of-town couple shopping with their daughters; one of the robbers then shot the couple with a semiautomatic pistol.<br />After the parents were taken to the hospital, one of their daughters shouted: “I hate this city!” The couple survived, but the young woman’s sentiment expressed the frustration of New Yorkers who had grown weary of the everyday violence of their city—a place where nearly 2,000 people were murdered every year—and couldn’t understand why their political leaders seemed powerless to do anything about it."
