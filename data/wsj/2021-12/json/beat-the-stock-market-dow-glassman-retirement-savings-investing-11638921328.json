    "body": "As he approaches retirement, Russell Wild is justifiably concerned (Letters, Dec. 1) that James Glassman is once again being overly optimistic (“Get Ready for Dow One Million,” op-ed, Nov. 3). Rest assured, Mr. Wild, that in 38 years of helping people become responsible stewards of the financial assets to which they have been temporarily entrusted, I have never known anyone who could successfully predict the market, at least in the short term.<br />I’m reminded of a story in which the late Jim Rothenberg, then-vice chairman of the Capital Group, a respected mutual-fund company, was asked his prediction of the market. “Young man,” he replied, “I don’t predict the rain. I help individuals build financial arks.”"
