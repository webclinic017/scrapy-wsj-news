    "body": "Progressives are breaking institutional norms left and right to impose their agenda. On Thursday Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Director Rohit Chopra went so far as to attempt a de facto coup against Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Chair Jelena McWilliams, a Trump appointee.<br />Mr. Chopra wants to use bank merger reviews to exercise more political control over lending. The 1960 Bank Merger Act requires the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC to consider the “convenience and needs of the community to be served” when reviewing merger proposals."
