    "body": "The Food and Drug Administration last week authorized two oral antiviral medicines for the early treatment of Covid-19. But don’t get too excited. The U.S. will still have a meager treatment arsenal this winter.<br />The U.S. has been relying on monoclonal-antibody treatments, but most don’t hold up against the Omicron variant. One, by  GlaxoSmithKline  and  Vir Biotechnology ,  does better at neutralizing the variant, but supply is limited.   Pfizer ’s  newly authorized antiviral pack Paxlovid will also have to be rationed. There will be more of Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics’ newly authorized antiviral, molnupiravir, but patients may be reluctant to take the drug. Some scientists worry it could cause DNA mutations in people, though the FDA determined that the likelihood of this was low when used on a short-term basis."
