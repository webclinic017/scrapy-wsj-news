    "body": "Chinese electric vehicles are speeding ahead in the country in 2021. Next they may want to make inroads overseas.<br />Sales of new-energy passenger vehicles in China, including plug-in hybrids, have nearly tripled from a year earlier in the first 11 months of 2021, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. And that is against the backdrop of a sluggish overall car market. New-energy vehicles accounted for nearly a fifth of passenger-car sales in November, compared with 6.2% for the whole 2020."
