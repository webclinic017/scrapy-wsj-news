    "body": "China’s anti-corruption watchdog criticized  Walmart Inc.  on Friday, warning of a consumer boycott following reports that the world’s largest retailer had stopped stocking products from Xinjiang in its China-based Walmart and Sam’s Club stores.<br />Walmart had no “justifiable reason” for taking down products from an entire region, the ruling Communist Party’s Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said in a strongly worded statement Friday. The agency added that the move was prompted by ulterior motives and showed “stupidity and short-sightedness.” The American big-box retailer would suffer the consequences for its actions, CCDI said."
