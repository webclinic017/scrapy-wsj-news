    "body": "WE COOK sometimes just to feed ourselves, but when we bake, it’s usually for other people. After all, no one can (should?) devour a tray of sea-salt brownies all on her own. And as we trudge into our second pandemic winter, the simple gesture of leaving a batch of cinnamon buns on a doorstep holds even more meaning than usual. Perhaps that’s why, for guidance, we gravitate to bakers who aren’t just masters of technique but also beacons of warmth.<br />Dessert doyenne Dorie Greenspan’s latest collection of recipes, “Baking with Dorie: Sweet, Salty & Simple” (Mariner Books), abounds with creativity as well as the veteran author’s trademark conversational coziness. And “Baking with Dorie” is exactly the experience her newest offering delivers—as much as any cookbook can."
