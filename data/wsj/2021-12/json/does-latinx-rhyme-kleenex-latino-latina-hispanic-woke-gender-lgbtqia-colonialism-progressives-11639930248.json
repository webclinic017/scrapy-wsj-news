    "body": "My mother was born Maria del Rio in Lima, Peru, which makes me at least as Latina as Rachel Zegler, the half-Colombian, half-Polish star of Steven Spielberg’s woke remake of “West Side Story.” And I want to say this on behalf of nearly every Hispanic American: Can you please stop calling us “Latinx”?<br />I can’t even figure out how “Latinx” is supposed to be pronounced. Does it rhyme with “sphinx” (how it looks on the printed page) or “Kleenex”? Sen. Elizabeth Warren says “Latin-ex,” as if referring to a Cuban man she once dumped. A word with a consonant followed by an x makes no sense in Spanish."
