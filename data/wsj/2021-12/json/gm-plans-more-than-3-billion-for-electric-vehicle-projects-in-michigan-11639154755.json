One would convert its Orion Assembly plant in suburban Detroit to serve as its hub for production of electric pickup trucks, the people with knowledge of the plans said. The renovation would cost at least $2 billion and would be expected to create more than 1,500 jobs at the factory, which today is lightly used, the people said."
