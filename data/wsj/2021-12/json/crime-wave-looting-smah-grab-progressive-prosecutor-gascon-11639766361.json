    "body": "Kudos to Daniel Henninger for pointing out the obvious regarding the surge in crime (“Blame Voters for the Crime Wave,” Wonder Land, Dec. 16). Last time I looked, we still are a democracy in which the people select their representatives. The so-called progressive prosecutors were elected to do the job that they announced they were going to do during their campaigns. Although I vehemently opposed George Gascón as Los Angeles district attorney (I left California in June), I do credit him with honesty about exactly what kind of “justice” he was going to administer. L.A. voted him in with eyes wide open.<br />H.L. Mencken’s quip continues to be applicable: “Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard.”"
