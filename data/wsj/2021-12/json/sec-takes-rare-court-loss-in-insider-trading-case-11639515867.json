    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Securities and Exchange Commission suffered a rare defeat in an insider-trading case, with a judge finding the regulator failed to prove a Virginia mortgage banker traded on illicit tips.<br />A federal judge in northern Virginia on Monday dismissed the civil fraud case against Christopher J. Clark, whose bullish and risky trades just before a 2017 acquisition were spotted by regulators’ high-powered surveillance databases. The SEC alleged Mr. Clark’s brother-in-law, a former corporate accounting officer, told him days before the deal that  Gartner Inc.  would buy CEB Inc."
