    "body": "Homebound during the pandemic, it seems everybody turned to fixing up their new or existing digs. But for  Angi Inc.,  the roof has caved in, with shares down nearly 31% year-to-date. If the online home-services company can’t thrive in a booming housing market, why should holding company  IAC/InterActiveCorp .  continue to invest in its remodel?<br />The value, like any good home improvement project, could lie in the finishes. A little over two years ago, IAC broached the idea of divesting its 84.6% stake in what was then called ANGI Homeservices. Today, Angi accounts for about half of IAC’s total revenue, and IAC is sticking by it amid a significant rebranding and a new chief executive officer. In a November 2019 shareholder letter, IAC Chief Executive Joey Levin wrote he felt Angi “could benefit from remaining inside IAC for the time being.” Perhaps he worried Angi’s shares wouldn’t be worth much without his help; or maybe he saw a diamond in the rough."
