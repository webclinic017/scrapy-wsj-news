    "body": "ONE SMALL GESTURE to consider when cooking for a group, whether you’re hosting at home or toting a dish to a potluck: Make each portion feel special somehow. I learned this working in restaurants, making and eating many staff meals. Those meals also taught me that the best and least stressful recipe for feeding a group can be assembled ahead of time and simply heated up when the time comes.<br />This recipe for lasagna roll-ups checks both those boxes. It’s a big, hearty, family-style, make-ahead meal, put together in such a way that the portions plate up less like big, sloppy slices, more like pretty pasta pinwheels."
