    "body": "Everyone and their brother is getting an online marketplace. What should investors make of it?<br />The channels, which allow third-party sellers to list, sell and ship items on an established retailer’s site, are having a bit of a moment. Grocery chain  Kroger  has one, and so do apparel sellers Express, Lands’ End, J.Crew and  Urban Outfitters .  Hudson’s Bay, a Canadian department store, launched its online marketplace earlier this year.  Macy’s  is the latest to jump on the bandwagon, announcing it will launch its marketplace in the second half of 2022."
