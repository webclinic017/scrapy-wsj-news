    "body": "I was happy to learn that Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and several other members of Congress visited the District of Columbia Jail recently. And I was flattered that her ensuing report, “Unusually Cruel,” quoted from my book and even borrowed its title. As someone who frequently visits prisons, I believe it is vital that people see firsthand the conditions of incarceration around the country—and realize the humanity of those behind bars.<br />Mrs. Greene’s report focuses on the “inhumane” conditions in which the Jan. 6 defendants are being held. “Cells in the January 6 wing of the CTF were extremely small, composed of a single toilet, sink and a small bed cot,” she notes. “The walls of the rooms had residue of human feces, bodily fluids, blood, dirt and mold. The community showers were recently scrubbed of black mold—some of which remained.” The report adds that inmates said they “did not have access to their attorneys, families or proper nutrition.”"
