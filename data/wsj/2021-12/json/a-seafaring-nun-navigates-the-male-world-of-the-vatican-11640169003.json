    "body": "VATICAN CITYâ€”Sister Nathalie Becquart is fond of nautical metaphors. She learned to sail as a small child during summer vacations with her family on the coast of Brittany in northwestern France and says becoming a skipper taught her about leadership.<br />The 52-year-old French woman says she is now drawing on those skills, after Pope Francis appointed her as the first woman to serve as an undersecretary of the Synod of Bishops earlier this year. The advisory body meets periodically in Rome to help the pope navigate topics of broad interest to the church."
