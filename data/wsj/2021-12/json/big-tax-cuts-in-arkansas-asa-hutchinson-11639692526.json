    "body": "Remember a year ago when Democrats were claiming that states needed a federal bailout to make up for a pandemic revenue drought? It wasn’t true at the time, but Congress passed some $325 billion in direct funding for states and localities in March anyway, and now most are swimming in cash. The good news is that some states are now returning some of the money to taxpayers, and the latest is Arkansas.<br />Gov. Asa Hutchinson recently signed legislation that reduces the top state income-tax rate to 5.5% from 5.9%, effective New Year’s Day. The rate will continue to drop in stages to 4.9% by 2025. The reform simplifies the tax code by combining the bottom two income thresholds into one that would pay a rate of 4.9%."
