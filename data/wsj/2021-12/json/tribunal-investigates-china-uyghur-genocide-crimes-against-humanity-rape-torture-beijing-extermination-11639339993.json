    "body": "London<br />An international tribunal investigating China’s oppression of the Uyghur people has charged Xi Jinping’s regime with genocide, crimes against humanity and systematic torture. The tribunal was requested by the World Uyghur Congress to investigate genocide and assembled independently by Sir Geoffrey Nice, the British barrister who prosecuted Slobodan Milosevic. In the tradition of independent people’s tribunals, it has no enforcement powers, but instead a moral and intellectual credibility that governments should heed. It is now vital that the international community act to stop these crimes and hold the perpetrators to account."
