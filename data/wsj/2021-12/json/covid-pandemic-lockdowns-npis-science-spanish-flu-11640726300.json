    "body": "Regarding Phillip Magness and Peter Earle’s op-ed “The Fickle ‘Science’ of Lockdowns” (Dec. 20): A 2007 article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reanalyzed the 1918 Spanish flu data. Those cities that early on implemented multiple nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including school, church and theater closings, as well as bans on public gatherings, had peak death rates approximately 50% lower than those that did not.<br />Few cities maintained NPIs longer than six weeks in 1918, so their effect on cumulative excess mortality was smaller. In the researchers’ summary, “These findings support the hypothesis that rapid implementation of multiple NPIs can significantly reduce influenza transmission, but that viral spread will be renewed upon relaxation of such measures.” I think readers should know that the evidence is not one-sided."
