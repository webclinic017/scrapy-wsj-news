    "body": "The announcement that  Didi Chuxing ,  China’s leading ride-hailing company, intends to delist its shares from the New York Stock Exchange sent shock waves through the global financial markets and investment community. Didi’s plan is to relist on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, allowing investors who bought shares on the NYSE to swap them for shares if and when there is a Hong Kong listing.<br />Less than six months ago, Didi raised billions of dollars from U.S. pension funds and international investors in a much-hyped initial public offering in New York. Yet on July 2, soon after the New York listing, Beijing’s Cyber Administration announced an investigation into Didi for potential violations of the country’s Data Security Law."
