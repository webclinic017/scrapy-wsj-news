    "body": "WASHINGTON—Mark Meadows emerged as a central figure in a congressional probe into the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol after he turned over texts and emails that contained details on then-President Trump’s effort to overturn the election result—and that showed Mr. Meadows was on the receiving end of a barrage of messages and calls from allies trying to halt the pro-Trump riot.<br />The House this week voted to hold Mr. Meadows in contempt of Congress after he declined to comply with a subpoena to testify in front of the panel investigating the riot. Now, the Justice Department must decide whether it will bring charges against him."
