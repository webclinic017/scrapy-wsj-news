    "body": "“How to Get Away With Manslaughter” (Review & Outlook, Dec. 4) uses provocative anecdotes to attack a Supreme Court ruling that reminded Oklahoma that U.S. treaties with tribal nations mean something. Oklahoma media offer a different perspective. “The observation of most media,” editorialized the Tahlequah Daily Press, “is that tribes and feds are working at a steady pace to bring these cases to bear.” The Tulsa World has suggested that curated outrage manifests “a bit of psychological denial” that “does nothing to make Oklahoma safer.”<br />What makes Oklahoma safer is tribal nations working effectively with law enforcement. Oklahoma is not a lawless frontier Deadwood. At Chickasaw Nation, where the reservation was affirmed in March, 70% of the charges our police develop are referred to nontribal courts, and 60% of the cases our prosecutors bring are referred to us by nontribal police. This pattern of partnership repeats throughout eastern Oklahoma, albeit with neither support nor cooperation from Oklahoma’s governor, who appears focused on recruiting national press to lay political siege to the court rather than engaging with tribal governments."
