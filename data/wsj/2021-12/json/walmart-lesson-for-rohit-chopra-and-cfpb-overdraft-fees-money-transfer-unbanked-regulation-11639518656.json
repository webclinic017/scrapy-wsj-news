    "body": "Customers pay overdraft fees when banks honor transactions that would otherwise result in insufficient funds. This can be useful for consumers who are essentially being floated a short-term loan to avoid denial of a transaction. That’s not how Rohit Chopra sees it. On Dec. 1, the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau declared that banks are “hooked on exploitative junk fees that can quickly drain a family’s bank account.”<br />In fact, overdraft fees aren’t an issue for most consumers. CFPB data show that only 9% of consumers are responsible for 80% of overdraft fees. What’s more, CFPB regulation requires financial institutions to obtain a consumer’s express opt-in to overdraft protection."
