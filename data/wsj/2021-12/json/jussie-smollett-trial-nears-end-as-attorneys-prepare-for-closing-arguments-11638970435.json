    "body": "CHICAGO—Lawyers are set to begin their closing arguments in Jussie Smollett’s criminal trial Wednesday in a case that has largely hinged on contradictory testimony from the former “Empire” actor and the two men who said he paid them to fake a hate crime against him.<br />Mr. Smollett, who is openly gay, told police that he had been attacked by two men who used racist and antigay slurs, hit and kicked him and placed a noose around his neck at around 2 a.m. on Jan. 29, 2019, as he walked home from picking up food at a Subway sandwich shop."
