    "body": "Didi Global Inc.’s shares fell to another record low Monday after a “lockup” period expired following its June initial public offering, even as the Chinese ride-hailing company sought to prevent employees from selling their stock.<br />The end of Didi’s 180-day lockup period, which was based on the June 29 date of its listing prospectus, freed up shares held by the firm’s early backers such as SoftBank Group Corp., Uber Technologies Inc. as well as international investors such as hedge funds, mutual funds and private-equity firms that collectively pumped billions of dollars into Didi before its IPO. Many of these shareholders have been sitting on large, unrealized losses for months."
