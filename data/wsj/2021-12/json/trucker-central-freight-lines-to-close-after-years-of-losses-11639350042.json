    "body": "Trucking company Central Freight Lines Inc. will wind down its business in the coming weeks after failing to halt years of losses despite strong demand in freight markets during the pandemic, the company said Sunday.<br />The privately held company based in Waco, Texas, has about 1,200 trucks and is a large operator in the less-than-truckload business, a slice of the trucking sector in which carriers move shipments from multiple customers on a single trailer. Most operators in that business have thrived over the past two years under heavy demand from retailers and manufacturers and the pandemic-driven boom in online shopping."
