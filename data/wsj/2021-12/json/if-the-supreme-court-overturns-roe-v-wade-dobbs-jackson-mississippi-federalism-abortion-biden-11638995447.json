    "body": "Historians of our era will forever try to pinpoint the event that caused Americans to reduce their politics to a constant lunge at one another’s throats. Always in the running for that catastrophe is the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion. This country’s politics will stay polarized until the broad consequences of the Roe decision are resolved.<br />Abortion returned to the fighting cage last week when the court heard oral arguments in the Dobbs case from Mississippi, which passed a law prohibiting abortion after 15 weeks."
