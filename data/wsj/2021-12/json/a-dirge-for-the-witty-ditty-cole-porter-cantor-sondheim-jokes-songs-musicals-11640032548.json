    "body": "It’s time to pay our final respects: The naughty song is a thing of the past. Before it withered away, it enjoyed a long, prosperous life. For decades, 20th-century tunesmiths produced risqué ditties. Dancing up to the edge of impropriety, they delighted us with songs about one of our favorite subjects—sex.<br />In 1919 the future opera sensation Rosa Ponselle and her sister, Carmela, recorded a gorgeous rendition of “Coming Through the Rye.” Though you’ll need a glossary to understand the Scottish lingo in Robert Burns’s 18th-century hymn to promiscuity, the gist of his naughty lyric is unmistakable: What happens in the rye, stays in the rye."
