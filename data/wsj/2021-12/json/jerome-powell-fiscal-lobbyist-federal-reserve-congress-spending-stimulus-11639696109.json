    "body": "Jerome Powell doesn’t want to admit that the Federal Reserve has helped to spur the current burst of inflation, which is now three times higher than the Fed’s target. We hope the central bank chairman can explain that one during his confirmation hearing.<br />But even if he thinks today’s inflation has no monetary roots, he shouldn’t be able to get away with his claim that he had nothing to do with the fiscal spending over the last 18 months that boosted excessive demand. That’s what he claimed in his Wednesday press conference when asked about the point. That’s not the Fed’s business, Mr. Powell rightly said."
