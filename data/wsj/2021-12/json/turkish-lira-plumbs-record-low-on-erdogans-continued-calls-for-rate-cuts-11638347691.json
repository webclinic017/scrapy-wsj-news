    "body": "ISTANBUL—Turkey’s currency crisis deepened after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan defended his policy of demanding lower interest rates despite rising inflation, sparking another selloff of the lira.<br />The currency hit record lows after Mr. Erdogan said he hoped interest rates would continue to fall until Turkey’s next national election in 2023. The president holds the unconventional view that cutting interest rates is the best way to stop soaring inflation and spur economic growth, a policy most economists say is a recipe for disaster."
