    "body": "‘Chile will be the tomb of neoliberalism,” Gabriel Boric promised after being chosen as the far left’s presidential candidate in July. His 56% to 44% victory over conservative José Antonio Kast in Sunday’s election gives him a chance to fulfill that promise.<br />The election was a referendum on Chile’s past four decades. While Mr. Kast backed the principles and institutions that brought unprecedented levels of prosperity, his rival pledged a new order based on left-wing populism and identity politics."
