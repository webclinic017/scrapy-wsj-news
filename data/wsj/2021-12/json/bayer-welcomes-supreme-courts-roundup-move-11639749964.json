    "body": "BERLIN—The U.S. Supreme Court’s request this week for the Biden administration to offer its views on a case about the alleged health risks of the Roundup weedkiller was an encouraging step, the head of Bayer AG told The Wall Street Journal.<br />The court’s move meant it has shown interest in the case and the company would continue its strategy to limit Roundup litigation risks, Werner Baumann, Bayer’s chief executive, told the Journal. The company said it would now suspend discussions over settling further Roundup disputes as the court considers whether to take on Bayer’s petition to toss out a previous verdict on Roundup."
