    "body": "Norman Lebrecht, in reviewing two books on the life and thought of Hannah Arendt (Nov. 6), claims that “By law and logic, she felt, [Adolf Eichmann] was unworthy of capture, trial, or execution.” But in “Eichmann in Jerusalem,” Arendt supported all three. She unequivocally supported the death penalty, writing, “Because he . . . had played a central role in an enterprise whose open purpose was to eliminate forever certain ‘races’ from the surface of the earth, he had to be eliminated.”<br />That justice was done would have become even more evident, Arendt adds, if the judges had said to Eichmann: “And just as you supported and carried out a policy of not wanting to share the earth with the Jewish people and the people of a number of other nations—as though you and your superiors had any right to determine who should and who should not inhabit the world—we find that no one, that is, no member of the human race, can be expected to want to share the earth with you. This is the reason, and the only reason, you must hang.”"
