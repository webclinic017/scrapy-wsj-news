It traces its origins back to the glasnost era of reforms ushered in by former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Its first chairman was Andrei Sakharov, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, and had long been a source of pride for Russians across the political spectrum.<br />But now government prosecutors are pushing for the group’s umbrella organization, International Memorial, and its human-rights wing, Memorial Human Rights Center, to be dissolved in what many people here view as one of the most shocking examples yet of how the Kremlin is squeezing space for dissent under President Vladimir Putin."
