    "body": "President Trump has formally endorsed 85 Republican candidates so far this year, probably far more than any other president so soon after leaving office. He’s backed incumbents, primary challengers and candidates in open races for everything from the Senate and House down to state representatives and even a small-town mayor’s office, often with statements offering his “Complete and Total Endorsement!”<br />Mr. Trump is likely doing this to maintain his hold over the GOP and keep open the possibility of a 2024 White House run. He also gets to enjoy a steady stream of supplicants arriving at his Mar-a-Lago estate or Bedminster, N.J., golf course to seek his backing."
