    "body": "The 1942 Battle of Guadalcanal proved the critical importance of the Solomon Islands for Pacific security. China’s rulers have studied this history. As Beijing seeks to displace the U.S. as the dominant power in the Pacific, it’s establishing a small police presence on the Solomon Islands that could easily grow. This development underscores the importance of U.S. engagement with the small but strategic sovereign states dotting the world’s largest ocean.<br />The besieged government of Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said last week it is accepting “shields, helmets, Batons and other non lethal” gear from China. “The Government has agreed to accept the Peoples’ Republic of China’s offer of riot equipment and six Police Liaison Officers to equip and train Royal Solomon Islands Police Force,” its statement said."
