    "body": "WASHINGTON—Former President Donald Trump lost his bid to shield his tax returns from the House Ways and Means Committee on Tuesday, after a federal judge dismissed the case.<br />The ruling from U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden may still be appealed, but it marks a significant win for Democrats in more than two years of attempts to obtain Mr. Trump’s tax returns. It would take separate actions by the Ways and Means Committee to make any of the documents public."
