    "body": "Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday made the toughest statements to date about Russia’s military buildup on its border with Ukraine. And on Thursday he’ll meet his Russian counterpart in Stockholm as tensions rise between Moscow and the U.S. The question is whether President Biden’s envoy can convince Vladimir Putin that the U.S. means what it says.<br />“We’re deeply concerned by evidence that Russia has made plans for significant aggressive moves against Ukraine,” Mr. Blinken said Wednesday at a meeting of NATO ministers in Latvia. “The plans include efforts to destabilize Ukraine from within, as well as large scale military operations.” In other words, Russia may be planning a coup in Kyiv."
