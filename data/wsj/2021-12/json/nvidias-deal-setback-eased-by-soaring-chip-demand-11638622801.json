    "body": "The exploding growth in semiconductor demand that has helped turn  Nvidia Corp.  into a chip titan is expected to ease the setback facing the company if it can’t complete its acquisition of Arm Holdings, analysts said.<br />The Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit Thursday alleging the acquisition of the chip-design specialist would give Nvidia unlawful control over computing technology that rivals need to develop their chips. The U.S. is the latest jurisdiction to take aim at the deal first announced in September 2020. The deal also faces scrutiny in the U.K., where Arm is based; the European Union; and China. The FTC said it was cooperating with other regulators, including in Japan and South Korea."
