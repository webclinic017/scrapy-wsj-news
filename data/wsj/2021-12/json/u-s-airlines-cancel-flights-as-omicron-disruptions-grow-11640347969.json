    "body": "The disruption caused by the highly transmissible Omicron variant is spreading, leading U.S. airlines to cancel flights over the busy holiday period and depleting staff levels at U.K. hospitals as health experts warn that Covid-19 is on its way to becoming endemic in the U.S.<br />However, indications are mounting that the disease caused by Omicron is milder than previous strains such as Delta and progresses faster, leading some countries to reduce quarantine periods in the hope of minimizing employee absences."
