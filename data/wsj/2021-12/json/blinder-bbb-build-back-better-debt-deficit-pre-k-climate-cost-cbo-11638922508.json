    "body": "Alan Blinder’s advice in “Look at Build Back Better’s Benefits, Not Its Price Tag” (op-ed, Dec. 6) is precisely the kind that has put the country on a path to budget ruin. His counsel is offered while the public debt-to-GDP ratio is already higher than it was immediately after World War II. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the public debt is on a path to approach 200% of GDP by 2050.<br />In claiming that President Biden’s spending plan is fully financed, Prof. Blinder glosses over the CBO’s estimate that the Build Back Better plan will add $750 billion to the budget deficit over five years—when the economy will likely be at full employment."
