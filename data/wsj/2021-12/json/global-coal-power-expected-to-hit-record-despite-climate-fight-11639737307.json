    "body": "Despite global efforts to slash carbon emissions, global coal-fired power generation is expected to rise 9% and hit a record by the end of 2021 as electricity demand from the economic recovery outstrips a shift to cleaner energy sources, the International Energy Agency said Friday.<br />The main drivers of the growth are China and India, which together account for roughly two thirds of the world’s coal use. Coal power is expected to notch increases of 9% in China and 12% in India to reach all-time highs in both countries by the end of the year, as electricity demand among the world’s two largest populations continues to grow."
