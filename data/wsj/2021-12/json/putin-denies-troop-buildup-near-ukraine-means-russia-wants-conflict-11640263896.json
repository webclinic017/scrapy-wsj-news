    "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin’s customary year-end audience with the Moscow media was more closely watched than usual for signs of what plans he might have in mind for Ukraine, as he again denied seeking a conflict with the West and defended what he called his country’s need to protect itself against NATO’s attempts to encroach on its doorstep.<br />For months now Russia has been massing tens of thousands of troops on its border with Ukraine, worrying leaders in both Kyiv and Western capitals that Mr. Putin was aiming to reprise a military campaign in 2014 when Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula."
