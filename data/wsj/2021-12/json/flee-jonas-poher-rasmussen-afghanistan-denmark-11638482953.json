    "body": "All too often animation is presumed innocent until proved otherwise—a medium best suited to wholesome cartoons, lyrical subjects and lighthearted fun. Nothing could be further from the truth, and few films have used the technique to more powerful effect than Jonas Poher Rasmussen’s “Flee.”<br />A mostly animated documentary from Denmark, this venturesome hybrid, playing in theaters, tells the shattering story of an ostensibly successful man—educated, accomplished, reasonably prosperous, about to be married—who fled Afghanistan as a child refugee after civil war threatened in the wake of the Soviet pullout in the late 1980s. The film is a documentary by virtue of being a factual story recounted by a real-life subject, whose first name is Amin. It’s animated, as well as punctuated by home movies and news footage, because the filmmaker, who first met Amin when they were kids together in a Danish high school, wanted to give his subject—and by now longtime friend—the anonymity he’d requested. Most of Amin’s family is currently scattered around the world, but some of his relatives have returned to Afghanistan: They might find themselves in danger if his identity were known."
