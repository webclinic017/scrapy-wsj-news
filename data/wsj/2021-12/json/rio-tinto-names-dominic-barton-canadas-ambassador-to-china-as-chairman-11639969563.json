    "body": "ADELAIDE, Australia— Rio Tinto  PLC said Dominic Barton, Canada’s ambassador to China, would become its chairman as the mining company strives to repair damage to its reputation from the destruction of two ancient rock shelters in Australia last year.<br />By selecting Mr. Barton, who will succeed Simon Thompson in May, Rio Tinto is hoping that a diplomat’s skill set can help it to navigate challenges that include rising resource nationalism in some key markets and demands from investors for mining companies to more aggressively address the environmental impact of their operations. Rio Tinto also makes most of its earnings in Australia, which is locked in a trade and diplomatic dispute with China."
