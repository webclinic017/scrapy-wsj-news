He also is the author of “A Human’s Guide to Machine Intelligence: How Algorithms Are Shaping Our Lives and How We Can Stay in Control.”<br />In October, MIT Prof. Sinan Aral warned his  Twitter  followers that he had discovered a video of himself that he hadn’t recorded endorsing an investment fund’s stock-trading algorithm. In reality, it wasn’t Prof. Aral in the video, but an artificial-intelligence creation in his likeness, or what is known as a highly persuasive “deepfake.”"
