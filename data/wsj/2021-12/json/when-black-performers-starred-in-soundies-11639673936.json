    "body": "In April 2015, a video titled “102 y/o Dancer Sees Herself on Film for the First Time” was uploaded on YouTube. Shot on cellphones in a Brooklyn nursing home, the seven-minute video shows Alice Barker, a Harlem nightclub dancer of the 1930s and 1940s, watching herself perform in vintage film clips. Old and young, Barker is entrancing—vivacious in her nursing-home bed, lissome and flirtatious on film. The video went viral immediately, and it has since been viewed more than 35 million times.<br />Whether they knew it or not, those millions of viewers had also discovered Soundies. A now-obscure film phenomenon of the 1940s, Soundies were three-minute films made to be shown on movie jukeboxes known as Panorams—free-standing, closed-system projection cabinets a little taller than a modern refrigerator. Located in bars, cafes, bus and train stations—the same kinds of places a music-only jukebox might be found—Panorams cost a dime per Soundie. The screen was roughly 17 inches high by 22 inches wide, big enough for a dozen or more viewers to watch together."
