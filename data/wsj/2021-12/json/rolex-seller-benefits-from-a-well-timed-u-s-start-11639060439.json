    "body": "Distracted by China for years, luxury brands are waking up to the spending power of Americaâ€™s shoppers. One Rolex retailer did well to rouse early.<br />Watches of Switzerland  said Thursday that sales increased 45% in the six months through October versus the comparable period of last year. Sales were also higher compared with pre-Covid 2019, by 41% overall and 67% in the U.S. Since its initial public offering in 2019, the company has zeroed in on the American watch market, which it thought was underdeveloped."
