    "body": "A former cadet at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy sued the school Wednesday, alleging the school’s policy barring cadets from being custodial parents violates federal law.<br />The suit was filed in federal court by Isaak Olson, who enrolled at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn., beginning in 2010. Mr. Olson alleges he was expelled in spring 2014, weeks before he was scheduled to graduate, after telling administrators that his fiancée had given birth to their first child."
