    "body": "Starbucks Corp.  baristas in Buffalo, N.Y. voted to form the first labor union at one of the coffee giant’s own U.S. cafes in its 50-year history, as workers across the country push companies for better pay and benefits in a tight labor market.<br />The result is a victory for cafe workers who had petitioned in August to vote on forming a union to have a direct channel of negotiation with the company, and a blow to Starbucks, which had spent months appealing to Buffalo-area baristas to vote down a labor body."
