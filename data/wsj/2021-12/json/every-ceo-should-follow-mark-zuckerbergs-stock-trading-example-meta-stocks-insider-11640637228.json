    "body": "Mark Zuckerberg has been criticized by privacy advocates, parents critical of social media, and politicians on Capitol Hill. But in one respect, the  Meta Platforms  CEO is the model executive. Mr. Zuckerberg trades shares in his company each trading day, ensuring that his diversification is done randomly and avoiding any possibility that he benefits from insider information. More executives should follow his lead, and the Securities and Exchange Commission might be smart to mandate they do.<br />The problem starts with CEO pay. It isn’t the canard that it is “excessive,” but a conundrum arises because CEOs are compensated primarily with company stock. This idea—a product of the early 1990s—revolutionized American corporations. By aligning the interests of CEOs and shareholders, equity pay reduced the temptation to build empires and focused corporate managers on creating value for shareholders."
