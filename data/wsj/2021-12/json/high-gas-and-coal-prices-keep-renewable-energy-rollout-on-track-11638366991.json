Case in point: fueling the renewable-energy revolution.<br />This will be another record year for building wind and solar farms, according to a report published Wednesday by the International Energy Agency. About 290 gigawatts of generating capacity is expected to be installed, up 3% on an exceptionally strong 2020. The trend should continue with an average of 305 GW forecast annually through 2026."
