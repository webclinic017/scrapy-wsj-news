    "body": "Saule Omarova on Tuesday withdrew her nomination to be Treasury’s lead bank regulator, and the White House is portraying her as a victim. The real fault lies with the White House advisers who thought they could push through a nominee for Comptroller of the Currency who loathes the banking system she was going to supervise.<br />“As a strong advocate for consumers and a staunch defender of the safety and soundness of our financial system, Saule would have brought invaluable insight and perspective to our important work on behalf of the American people,” President Biden said in a statement. “But unfortunately, from the very beginning of her nomination, Saule was subjected to inappropriate personal attacks that were far beyond the pale.”"
