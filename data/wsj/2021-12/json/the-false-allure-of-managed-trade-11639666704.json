    "body": "In 2018, President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on almost all aluminum and steel imported into the U.S., whether it came from allies, such as the EU, or competitors, such as China. Taken aback, the EU retaliated with tariffs on  Harley-Davidson  motorcycles, Kentucky bourbon and other U.S. exports. A trans-Atlantic rift had opened, and officials in Brussels rejected any possibility of repairing it with a “managed trade” agreement, in which governments agree on tariff-free trade in certain goods up to a specified level, after which tariffs kick in. Accepting such a deal on metals might help some European exporters, but it would undermine the principles of free trade embodied in the rules of the World Trade Organization.<br />In October, however, the EU reversed course. Under a new managed trade agreement, the EU can export 4.4 million metric tons of steel, for example, to the U.S. duty-free in 2022. Exports beyond that amount will be subject to tariffs at the same rate as under Trump. The EU agreed to the deal in part because Canada and Mexico, which had once stood with Europe on the issue, had already accepted a similar arrangement, and their steel exports to the U.S. were back to pre-Trump levels. The EU had been left standing alone."
