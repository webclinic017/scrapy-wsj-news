    "body": "A bipartisan group of U.S. senators plans to introduce legislation that would require  Meta Platforms Inc.  and other social-media companies to provide outside researchers with data access.<br />The bill, to be announced Thursday by Sens. Chris Coons (D., Del.) Rob Portman (R., Ohio) and Amy Klobuchar (D.,Minn.), would allow researchers to submit proposals to the National Science Foundation. If the NSF supports a proposal, social-media platforms would be required to furnish the needed data, subject to privacy protections that could include anonymizing it or “white rooms” in which researchers could review sensitive material."
