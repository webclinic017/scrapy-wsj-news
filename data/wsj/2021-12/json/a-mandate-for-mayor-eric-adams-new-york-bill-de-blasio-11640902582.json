    "body": "New Yorkers have special reason to celebrate this New Year’s Eve, which is the last day of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s eight years of progressive failure. Everything in the city is worse than Mr. de Blasio found it, which means new Mayor Eric Adams inherits a mess but also has a turnaround opportunity.<br />Mr. Adams has three main challenges, and the portents from his early decisions are good. The first is restoring public order, which as a former police captain the new mayor well understands. He emerged from the crowded Democratic primary on a pledge to reduce the crime wave that has surged as Mr. de Blasio, the City Council, Democrats in Albany and prosecutors demonized police and let criminals out of jail free."
