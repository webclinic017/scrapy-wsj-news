    "body": "JUST AS MORE countries began to reopen to foreign tourists, the Omicron variant prompted a flurry of new restrictions. But many travelers, determined to venture somewhere more exciting than cousin Eddie’s cabin in the Catskills, remain undaunted. They’re willing to jump through the necessary hurdles to travel overseas again. A series of new mobile apps and websites promise to help efficiently overcome those hurdles, namely by keeping track of vaccination and testing records and other critical paperwork. Variously called “digital health passes” or “health passports,” they’re increasingly offered by international airlines.<br />For many foreign trips these days, you’ll need to provide proof of vaccination or a recent recovery from Covid, as well a negative Covid test. “It’s fallen to the airlines to do the vetting,” said Peter Vlitas, executive vice president, partner relations, at Internova Travel Group, but there’s no standardized app credential."
