    "body": "When you’re behind the wheel of a 4,000-pound automobile at 60 miles an hour, distractions cost lives. Drivers nonetheless take selfies, livestream on  Facebook ,  respond to text messages, and scroll through news feeds. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an average of eight people a day die in accidents caused by distracted driving.<br />Smartphones are often at the root of these tragedies. As Big Tech sets its sights on modern vehicles, it’s appropriate to ask if it’s time to limit attention-stealing technology that distracts the driver."
