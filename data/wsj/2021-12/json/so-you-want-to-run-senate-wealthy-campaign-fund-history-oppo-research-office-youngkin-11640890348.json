    "body": "Glenn Youngkin’s surprise gubernatorial win in Virginia has other wealthy Wall Streeters thinking they could run and win too—and the Republican Party is egging them on, remembering the $20 million of personal money Mr. Youngkin threw into his campaign.<br />There are a few questions these would-be politicos need to answer. Here’s a place to start: How many elections have you voted in? Just a few at the presidential level? That’s not good. Why do you expect to be welcomed by the folks who have been sweating it out on the ground? The party faithful have voted regularly. They’ve turned out for school-board and bond elections. They’ve voted for the local community college’s board of governors."
