    "body": "The House passed the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) this week, 363-70, and the press is focusing on cultural issues like tweaks to the military’s justice system and the defeated proposal to draft women. But the bigger story is that Congress delivered a bipartisan rebuke to the utterly unrealistic defense budget the Biden Administration released earlier this year.<br />President Biden in May proposed $715 billion for the Department of Defense in 2022. That was a 1.6% increase from 2021, an inflation-adjusted cut to America’s national security in a world of growing threats. The $740 billion NDAA passed by the House and likely headed to the President’s desk authorizes a 5.2% increase."
