    "body": "I turned 50 in June, and planned a South Carolina beach getaway with my wife, Devin, and two other couples. It felt extravagant, but that’s only because I was raised by a father who’d shut down his kids’ vacation inquiries by dryly asking, “What are we, the Gettys?”<br />In his defense, my old man was from the generation who believed gainful employment, three squares a day and a roof over your head were vacation enough from the vicissitudes of life. To seek more was to tempt fate and, like Icarus, fly too high on borrowed wings."
