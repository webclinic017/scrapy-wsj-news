It still won’t be an easy one.<br />The cloud software pioneer’s fiscal third-quarter results late Tuesday included the news that Bret Taylor, who has been serving as the company’s president and chief operating officer since 2019, has been named co-CEO to work alongside longtime chief Marc Benioff. It is the company’s second attempt at the unusual leadership structure; the first lasted 18 months until co-CEO Keith Block left in February 2020."
