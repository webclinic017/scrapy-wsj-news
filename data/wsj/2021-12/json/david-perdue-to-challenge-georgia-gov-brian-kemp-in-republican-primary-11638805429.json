    "body": "ATLANTA—Former Republican Sen. David Perdue said Monday he would challenge Georgia’s GOP Gov. Brian Kemp in the gubernatorial primary in May.<br />Mr. Perdue’s announcement launches a public struggle for control of the Republican Party in the state between many supporters of former President Donald Trump who back Mr. Perdue and many party stalwarts backing Mr. Kemp. Mr. Perdue narrowly lost a bid to be re-elected a U.S. senator earlier this year."
