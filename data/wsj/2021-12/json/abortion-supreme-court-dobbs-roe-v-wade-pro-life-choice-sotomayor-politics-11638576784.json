    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Sotomayor Gets Political” (Dec. 2): Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked, “Will this institution survive the stench that this creates in the public perception that the Constitution and its reading are just political acts? . . . I don’t see how it is possible.” The justice appears to be arguing the court should base its decision on a political consideration, the Supreme Court’s public image, in order to avoid having the court appear political. Is it too much to ask that a justice be logically fluent enough to understand that her statement is contradictory and self-defeating?<br />David B. Gerges"
