    "body": "Jimmy Cayne, the bridge-playing chief executive who led Bear Stearns until it nearly collapsed in 2008, died Tuesday. He was 87.<br />Mr. Cayne became a poster child for financial mismanagement when the investment firm he had run since 1993 as Wall Streetâ€™s longest-serving CEO, toppled under a heavy debt load and trading losses. It was sold to  JPMorgan Chase & Co .  in a fire-sale deal backed by the U.S. government."
