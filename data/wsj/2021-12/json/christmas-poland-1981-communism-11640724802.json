    "body": "Thomas Swick’s “Christmas in Communist Poland” (op-ed, Dec. 24) brings back memories of my first trip to Warsaw, Christmas week, 1981. I was new to my job as head of First Chicago’s Eastern European office. My boss accompanied me to introduce me to our three Polish customers, the only three banks in the country.<br />My boss took along an extra-large suitcase. He had a soft spot in his heart for the Poles and always visited Warsaw Christmas week to bring presents to our friends there. The suitcase was packed with luxuries unimaginable to everyday Poles: fine German coffee, Swiss chocolates, Hermès scarves and French perfumes. Everything was individually wrapped so that the recipient could open it in privacy, avoiding embarrassment. Of course, they had presents for us as well: things like art books and locally made porcelain and crystal."
