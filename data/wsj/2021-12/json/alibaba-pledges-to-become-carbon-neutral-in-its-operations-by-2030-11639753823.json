    "body": "HONG KONG— Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  sought to reassure investors about its growth trajectory in presentations during its annual investor day, as it also unveiled environmental-sustainability goals, pledging to become carbon neutral in its operations by 2030.<br />One of China’s most iconic companies, Alibaba has been grappling with a mountain of challenges over the past year.
