    "body": "Riot Games, the company behind videogames such as League of Legends and Valorant, has agreed to pay $100 million to settle female workers’ allegations of gender discrimination.<br />The deal closes out three years of litigation over allegations that Riot—a subsidiary of China’s  Tencent Holdings Ltd. —paid women less than men, held back their careers and mistreated them in other ways. The case was one of several instances in recent years of women calling out what they saw as unequal treatment in the ranks of the videogame industry."
