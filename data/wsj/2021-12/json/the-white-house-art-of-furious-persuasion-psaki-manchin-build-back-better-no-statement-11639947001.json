    "body": "The progressive whiz kids who run President Biden’s White House don’t have much sense of self-restraint—or common political sense. Their response on Sunday to Sen. Joe Manchin’s opposition to Build Back Better was to accuse him of bad faith while saying they’ll beat him up until he changes his mind.<br />Press secretary Jen Psaki issued a blistering statement saying Mr. Manchin’s comments on Fox News Sunday “are at odds with his discussions this week with the President, with White House staff, and with his own public utterances.” We can’t speak for his private White House talks, but Mr. Manchin’s public comments have been consistent for months. On Sunday he finally said no."
