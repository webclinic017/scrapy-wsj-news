    "body": "OTTAWA—The Canadian government and Bank of Canada agreed Monday to renew the central bank’s mandate to target 2% annual inflation, with an emphasis on giving the central bank flexibility to address economic challenges and help obtain full employment when conditions warrant.<br />The mandate was set to expire at the end of the month. Like elsewhere in the world, Canada is dealing with accelerated price increases—annual inflation of 4.7% as of October, or an 18-year high—that is fueling concern among Bank of Canada officials. Strong labor-market gains and elevated inflation prompted the Bank of Canada this fall to move up the timetable for its first rate increase in over three years, and end its large-scale asset-purchase program, also known as quantitative easing, introduced to help stabilize financial markets during the pandemic."
