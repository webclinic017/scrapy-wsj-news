    "body": "A man who walked into a busy Japanese mental-health clinic with a paper bag carrying flammable liquid is under investigation for murder and arson after the liquid ignited a fire that killed 24 people.<br />The blaze on the fourth floor of an office building in central Osaka was one of the deadliest in modern Japanese history. Witnesses and experts said the victims probably died of carbon monoxide poisoning as the fire burned through the tight space with only one clear means of exit, an emergency stairwell."
