    "body": "BlackRock Inc.  is pulling some $2 trillion of assets out of  State Street Corp.’s  safekeeping, a move that will reduce the investing firm’s reliance on a small number of parties and lower the fees it pays for back-office work.<br />For more than a decade, State Street served as the sole custodian to BlackRock’s U.S. exchange-traded funds—low-cost investment vehicles that have exploded in popularity in recent years. State Street services all of the roughly $2.3 trillion across those BlackRock funds."
