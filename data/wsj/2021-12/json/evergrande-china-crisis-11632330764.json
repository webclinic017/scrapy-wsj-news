    "body": "The world’s stock and bond markets are closely watching  China Evergrande Group ,  a Chinese property developer that hasn’t made payments on some of its debt. If not resolved, it threatens to become the largest debt default by a company in Asia, which could jolt investor confidence across markets globally. Beijing seems reluctant to bail out the company but is taking steps to limit the damage. Here’s a quick look at the company, its problems and the possible fallout.<br />Evergrande is an enormous—and heavily indebted—private-sector Chinese property developer and home builder that is close to defaulting on some of its billions of dollars in debt. The company missed a Sept. 23 deadline on an $83.5 million interest payment due on some of its dollar-denominated bonds. Evergrande avoided default by making the payment Oct. 21, as the end of a 30-day grace period neared, Chinese state media reported. The company bought some more time by making a second overdue interest payment, of $45 million, on dollar bonds later in October, The Wall Street Journal reported Oct. 29."
