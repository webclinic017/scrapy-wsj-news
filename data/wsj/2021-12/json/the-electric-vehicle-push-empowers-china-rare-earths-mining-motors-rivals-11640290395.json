    "body": "The Biden administration wants to spend billions on electric-vehicle subsidies and charging stations because, as Vice President Kamala Harris put it in a Dec. 13 speech, “climate change has become a climate crisis and it demands urgent action.” But rushing to replace gasoline-powered cars with electric vehicles would hand the keys to the American transportation sector to China, given Beijing’s near-monopoly on rare-earth elements like neodymium and dysprosium, which are used in the high-output motors of most electric vehicles.<br />The Journal reported Dec. 3 that the Chinese government is consolidating assets from state firms to create a new global champion called the China Rare Earth Group. The state-run Global Times quoted a manager at a state-owned rare-earth enterprise based in Ganzhou: “The new company will enforce stricter rules on the production quantity as well as the export volume of rare earths, which may also drive up prices.”"
