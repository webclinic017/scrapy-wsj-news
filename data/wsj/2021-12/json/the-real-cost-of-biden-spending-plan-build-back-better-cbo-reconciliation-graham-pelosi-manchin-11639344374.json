    "body": "President Biden’s tax and entitlement plan received what should be a pair of knockout punches late last week. The report of surging inflation has been well covered. But the media have largely ignored the second blow—the real cost of the plan if honestly scored. Allow us to complete the record.<br />We’ve been telling you for months that the plan’s advertised cost of $1.75 trillion over 10 years includes multiple budget gimmicks that disguise the real cost. The Penn Wharton Budget Model has scored the 10-year cost at about $4.6 trillion, but the White House keeps claiming against all evidence that the cost is “zero.”"
