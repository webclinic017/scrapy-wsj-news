    "body": "The Nevada Supreme Court ruled gun manufacturers and distributors couldn’t be held responsible for the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history because of existing state law.<br />In a unanimous decision Thursday, the Nevada Supreme Court said state law grants gun manufacturers and distributors immunity from “wrongful death and negligence per se claims,” meaning they couldn’t be held liable for the actions of the gunman who opened fire in October 2017 on the Route 91 Harvest festival in Las Vegas."
