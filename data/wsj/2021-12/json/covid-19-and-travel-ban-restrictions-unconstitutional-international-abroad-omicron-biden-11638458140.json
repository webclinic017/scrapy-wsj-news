    "body": "President Biden has followed President Trump’s lead in attempting to use international travel bans to reduce the spread of Covid-19. But Mr. Biden is reportedly considering an expansion of the policy. U.S. citizens, permanent residents and their immediate relatives are all exempt from existing travel bans.<br />The Washington Post reports the administration is considering a mandatory seven-day quarantine for everyone arriving from abroad—regardless of citizenship, vaccination or a negative Covid test. Some observers have urged officials to go further and ban entry by unvaccinated citizens or by citizens returning from high-risk countries."
