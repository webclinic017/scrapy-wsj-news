    "body": "The Supreme Court ruled Friday in a case involving S.B.8, the Texas law that bans abortions at around six weeks. But despite all the alarms, this opinion had nothing to do with the merits of the law or the right to abortion. The issue was legal standing. Credit the majority opinion by Justice Neil Gorsuch for refusing to rip up old doctrines to create some for-abortion-only exception.<br />The key question: Who can sue whom? S.B.8 was written to be difficult to block before its enforcement, because state officials were meant to play no role. Instead the law authorizes private parties to bring lawsuits. So until somebody tries to enforce S.B.8, where can abortion providers go to seek relief? The Court unanimously agreed Friday in Whole Woman’s Health v. Jackson that they cannot pre-emptively bring a lawsuit against a citizen who swore he had no plans to try to enforce S.B.8."
