    "body": "Latin America, or much of it, is moving to the populist left, and Chile became the latest example by electing socialist Gabriel Boric in Sunday’s presidential runoff election. He defeated conservative former congressman José Antonio Kast by a surprisingly large margin of 56%-44%, which means he can pursue his campaign pledge to redistribute income and usher in a new constitution.<br />The 35-year-old Mr. Boric is a member of the lower house of Congress and represents the left-wing Social Convergence party. He’s the most leftist politician to win in Chile since Salvador Allende in the 1970s. His major theme was reducing economic inequality, which he proposes to do through state power."
