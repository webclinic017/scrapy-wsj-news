    "body": "While Jerome Powell was a better choice than Lael Brainard for Federal Reserve chairman, that alone isn’t a good reason to confirm Mr. Powell for a second term. The Senate should not support his reappointment.<br />The Fed’s core mission is to ensure stable prices and a sound currency. No one can seriously argue that it accomplished this mission under Mr. Powell’s leadership. After years of reckless policy, inflation now exceeds 6%—the highest rate in 30 years."
