    "body": "Michael Meyers of the New York Civil Rights Coalition accuses Asian-Americans of “bellyaching” (Letters, Dec. 20), but he never grapples with the evidence of Ivy League discrimination. Asian-Americans are being targeted to bear the burden of racial remedies, even though their families are more likely to have been discriminated against than to have been part of the discriminating elite. Supposedly progressive elites are robbing a new set of victims to try to make up for past injustices. This is the bank robber hitting a second bank to hand out refunds to the victims of his first bank robbery.<br />Does this even accomplish its objective? Mr. Meyers implies that racial preferences help those who were the victims of prior discrimination. But take a good look at the demographics of African-Americans who get in to Harvard, and notice the high percentage with recent family from the Caribbean or Africa, or family from the upper-middle class. Middle- and working-class first-generation Asian-American kids, whose parents were refugees from communism, are excluded to make spots for upper-class kids of a higher racial caste. That’s not a remedy that promotes justice."
