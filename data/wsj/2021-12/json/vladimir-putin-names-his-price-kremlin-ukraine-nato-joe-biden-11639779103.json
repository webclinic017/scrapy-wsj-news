    "body": "Russia has spent the fall massing troops and weaponry along Ukraine’s borders, laying the groundwork for a potential invasion. On Friday the Kremlin made its demands public. The U.S. and Europe have delivered a mixed response so far and will have to do more to deter Vladimir Putin.<br />Moscow wants NATO to rule out eastward expansion and roll back military activity in a range of theaters, according to draft documents sent to the U.S. and allies this week. This would mean blocking Ukrainian accession to the alliance and effectively banning NATO forces from being stationed in member states like Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania."
