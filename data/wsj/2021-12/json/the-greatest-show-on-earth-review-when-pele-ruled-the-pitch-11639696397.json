    "body": "Since your average professional soccer player is more articulate with his feet than with his tongue, readers could be forgiven for approaching “The Greatest Show on Earth”—an oral history of the 1970 World Cup—with a mild case of the jitters. Platitudes, as much as goals,are the soccer player’s stock in trade. Yet the voices in this charming book—each one an aging football star’s—are eloquent to a man.<br />The book is billed by its subtitle as “the inside story of the legendary 1970 World Cup.” As it happens, the cup was held in Mexico that year—outside Europe or South America for the first time. The author is Andrew Downie, a soccer correspondent for Reuters, but he’s really a curator, gracefully piecing together first-person accounts from players who are still alive and inclined to share their stories."
