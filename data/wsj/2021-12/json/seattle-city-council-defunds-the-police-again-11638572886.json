    "body": "Some politicians are getting the message that crime doesn’t pay politically, with Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf this week seeking to hire more police. “There’s nothing progressive about unbridled gun violence,” the mayor said. Then there’s Seattle, where the incorrigible City Council has voted to defund the police for the second year in a row.<br />Last week the City Council voted 8-1 for a 2022 city budget that cuts police funding by more than $7 million. That slash comes after the City Council cut the 2021 police budget by nearly $35.6 million, or 9%, from 2019."
