    "body": "Staged versions of “A Christmas Carol” come in every possible flavor. In 2020, though, they were all streamed, for America’s theaters were still shut by Covid-19. This year they’re mostly open again—at least for the moment—and several regional theaters have opted to break the long hiatus with productions of Charles Dickens’s holiday-themed classic, many of which are simultaneously being streamed.<br />One of the latter is Rhode Island’s Trinity Repertory Company, which has been performing its own version of “A Christmas Carol” for the past 45 years—it is restaged and reworked anew each season—and which has now brought it back to Trinity’s 500-seat Providence stage after a 20-month hiatus in public performances. It’s a broad, genially acted, multiracial big-stage production that is comprehensively child-friendly, though it also contains some not-so-subtle political touches: Scrooge (Timothy Crowe) is white, for example, while Bob Cratchit and Marley’s chained-up ghost (Rodney Witherspoon and Ricardo Pitts-Wiley) are Black."
