    "body": "Actor Jussie Smollett is standing trial in Chicago for allegedly faking a hate crime in late January 2019, after telling police and the media that two men had hit him, hung a noose around his neck and yelled a pro-Donald Trump slogan along with racist and antigay slurs.<br />A Chicago police detective testified at the trial that law enforcement spent days trying to find the alleged assailants and ended up determining that Mr. Smollett had paid the men to stage the purported attack. Lawyers involved in the case have agreed to not comment publicly during the trial. Mr. Smollett has entered a plea of not guilty."
