    "body": "JOHANNESBURG—It is still too early to tell whether Covid-19 caused by the new Omicron variant is milder or more severe than that from other strains of the coronavirus, doctors tracking a rapidly growing outbreak in South Africa said Friday.<br />The country, which has more known Omicron cases than any other, is likely to be the first to deliver answers to the questions doctors and scientists have been grappling with since the World Health Organization declared the new strain a “variant of concern” a week ago. Key among those are whether Omicron makes those infected sicker, whether it is more transmissible and in how far current Covid-19 vaccines or a past infection protect against the variant."
