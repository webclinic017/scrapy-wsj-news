    "body": "Dozens of cities and states are enacting new laws to protect tenants facing eviction, aiming to stem a tide of new cases and offer renters more ways to settle conflicts with property owners.<br />Eviction filings nationwide started ticking up in September after a yearlong national eviction moratorium ended. By October, the more than 48,000 filings represented a 24% increase over those registered in August, according to Eviction Lab, a research group at Princeton University that tracks filings in 31 cities and six states."
