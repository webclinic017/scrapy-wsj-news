    "body": "Of all the inventions of recent times, none is more reflexively disparaged than the ostensibly annoying “ping” from our smartphones announcing that we have new messages or news updates. The dreaded ping, we are told by the high priests of the electronic decluttering community, is invasive and distracting and slowly but surely drives us all mad. The mythology of pingophobes is that without the ceaseless interruptions from pings and dings and squawks and tingling sounds we could finish that report for HR, tighten those abs, learn Chinese, balance the federal budget and really get this society firing on all cylinders.<br />This is nonsense. It’s like saying that without gas we wouldn’t have to spend so much time driving our cars. This is worse than shooting the messenger for being the bearer of bad tidings. It’s shooting the messenger for bearing any tidings."
