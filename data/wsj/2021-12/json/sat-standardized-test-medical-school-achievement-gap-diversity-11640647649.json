    "body": "In “By Ditching the SAT, Harvard Hurts Minority Students” (Upward Mobility, Dec. 22), Jason Riley correctly states that “eliminating the test won’t eliminate the racial achievement gap, because the test is not causing the gap, merely exposing it.” It is apparent to this public-high-school math teacher with nearly 30 years in the trenches that the achievement gap is stubbornly tenacious. Yet rather than risk speculating on the root causes of the gap, educators and administrators take a collective sigh of relief when the measures of the gap evaporate from the educational domain.<br />California has worked assiduously to eliminate the achievement-gap smoke alarms: no standardized testing at the state or local level, no high-school competency tests or exit exams, no benchmark testing and crimp SAT results."
