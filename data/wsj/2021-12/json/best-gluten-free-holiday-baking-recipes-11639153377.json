    "body": "MY GO-TO dessert when baking for someone avoiding gluten has always been a nut torte. This type of flourless cake gets its structure from nut flours and eggs, and takes very well to chocolate. But one recent day, with a bag of freshly picked apples and a gluten-sensitive dinner guest on the way, I decided to brave a gluten-free galette. While most recipes simply call for substituting wheat flour with a wheat-free flour blend, I sensed that this approach would yield limited success.<br />I called Katarina Cermelj, a Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry and the author of “Baked to Perfection: Delicious Gluten-Free Recipes With a Pinch of Science,” for advice. The subject of our call quickly became xanthan gum, a binder that gives gluten-free recipes the elasticity and flexibility the gluten in wheat flour would otherwise provide. Dr. Cermelj suggested I add a pinch of the gum—sold as a powder—to water. A gel formed instantly, illustrating why it’s called gum. This experiment was also her way of warning me that a little goes a long way. That night, xanthan gum saved my galette dough from being dry and crumbly. The flaky crust proved so good, in fact, that I used it the following day for a pissaladière, the Provençal onion tart."
