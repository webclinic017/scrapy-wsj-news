    "body": "Regarding “Millennials Are Writing Wills Amid Covid Fears” (Personal Journal, Dec. 7): The oversimplification of “you need a will” can lead to waste, with assets going to attorneys, legal-filing fees and other expenses that are avoided with a proper plan.<br />In New York and California, simply having a will is insufficient. In California, if the deceased has only a will and has more than $166,000 in assets (outside of certain asset classes), then you are required to go to probate court. If you have real estate, you almost always must go unless you have a trust (or if the real estate is worth $50,000 or less)."
