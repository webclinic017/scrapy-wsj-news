    "body": "WASHINGTON—Democrats are struggling to lock down the support of a pivotal senator necessary for quickly advancing their roughly $2 trillion education, healthcare and climate package, casting the future of monthly child tax credit payments into doubt.<br />The final monthly payments of the expanded child tax credit authorized under current law hit bank accounts Wednesday. A one-year extension of that break is a central plank of Democrats’ package, and the Internal Revenue Service has told lawmakers that they must extend the program by Dec. 28 to keep January’s payments on track, a deadline that party leaders have aimed to meet."
