    "body": "Politicians need ambition, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer may be taking it too far in demanding that his chamber pass the National Defense Authorization Act, federal budget, debt-ceiling increase and Build Back Better Act before Christmas.<br />After refusing to bring up the NDAA for four months, Mr. Schumer now insists it has to pass this week without consideration of the 20 or so amendments offered by Democrats and Republicans. GOP senators won’t reward Mr. Schumer’s slow-rolling dodge. They’ll force votes on the amendments, and after Mr. Schumer gets over not having his way procedurally, the NDAA will pass overwhelmingly."
