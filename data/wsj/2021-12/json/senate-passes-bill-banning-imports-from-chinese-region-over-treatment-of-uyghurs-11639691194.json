    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Senate passed legislation Thursday to ban imports from China’s Xinjiang region over concerns about the use of forced labor, sending the bill to President Biden, who is expected to sign it.<br />The passage, by unanimous consent, comes as Washington cracks down on China for its treatment of the Uyghurs, which lawmakers have said amounts to genocide. The Biden administration also announced sanctions on Thursday that will target Chinese biotech and surveillance companies for their actions in Xinjiang."
