    "body": "Nothing is certain when it comes to how the Omicron variant of Covid-19 will affect economic growth, inflation and interest rates. Nothing, perhaps, except the value of the greenback.<br />On Thursday, U.S. officials said they would toughen testing for international visitors. A day before, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned that Omicron could keep inflation running higher for longer and pose a severe risk to its forecast for 4.5% growth next year. At the same time, there are indications that Omicron may not be as deadly or vaccine-resistant as feared."
