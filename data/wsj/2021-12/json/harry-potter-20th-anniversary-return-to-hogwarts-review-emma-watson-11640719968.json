    "body": "Anyone who’s grown up reading the novels of J.K. Rowling, or has children or grandchildren who’ve done the same, will experience a certain sense of magical nostalgia at the outset of “Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts.” By the end, they will feel as if Dementors have swept in and sucked the joy out of their souls.<br />The reunion special—which like the two-part “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” (2010-11) feels twice as long as it ought to have been—features an extensive number of clips from the “Harry Potter” film series. There are faux-intimate interviews with its directors and actors; a salute to the remarkable number of cast members who have died since the first film was released in 2001; and reminiscences by the kids who grew up playing the student body of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and still seem to exist in a bubble. There are only so many times one can listen to Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint (Harry, Hermione and Ron) talk about how close they were, what a remarkable experience the movies were and how important the Potter stories were to young people everywhere. What young people? Have they met any? As is the case with most of the other actors interviewed, the recollections are suffocatingly personal, self-important, repetitive and airless."
