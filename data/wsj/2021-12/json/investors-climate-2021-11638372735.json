    "body": "At the Glasgow climate summit in November, more than 140 countries announced goals to reach net zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050.<br />While uncertainty abounds over how or whether these pledges will be realized, one thing was clear: There’s a lot of money—from companies, institutional investors and individual investors—riding on a belief in the opportunities associated with a carbon-constrained world. On the sidelines of Glasgow, private investors were converging around new firms from a range of businesses that hope to profit from reducing emissions. There were satellite-enabled emissions-verification companies; firms that will pull carbon out of the air and mineralize it into stone that can be buried underground; companies that manufacture meatless food products from fungal-based mycoprotein; and more."
