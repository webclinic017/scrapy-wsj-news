    "body": "Kleptocracy deprives the developing world of trillions of dollars each year, fueling poverty and conflict while entrenching powerful regimes in China, Russia, Iran and Venezuela. From the failure in Afghanistan to the unopposed expansion of Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative, corruption plays a pervasive role in undermining U.S. foreign policy and national security.<br />The Biden administration last week released a new anticorruption strategy and highlighted the issue as a pillar of the U.S.-led Summit for Democracy. The strategy contains dozens of initiatives, including reforms such as broadening anti-money-laundering regulations beyond the banking industry and criminalizing bribes of American companies by foreign officials."
