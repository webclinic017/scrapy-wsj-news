    "body": "William Schneider Jr. makes excellent recommendations in “Deter Russia by Arming NATO Allies” (op-ed, Dec. 9). I would add that NATO’s European contingent will not be effective until Germany becomes a strong leader, demonstrating support for the alliance by spending an amount commensurate with the power of its economy.<br />Under Angela Merkel, Germany’s support for NATO was limited, and the 2% of GDP military-spending goal was not reached. Ms. Merkel placed trade and investments over security. Vladimir Putin understood she would criticize his provocation but never push sanctions or restrictions that would adversely affect the German economy. Deterring Russia starts with a stronger German investment in NATO."
