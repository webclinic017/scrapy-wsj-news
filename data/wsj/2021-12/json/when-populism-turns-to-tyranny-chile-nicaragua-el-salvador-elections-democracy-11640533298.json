    "body": "It’s been a tough year for liberty in Latin America, and it would be a mistake to blame it on Covid-19. The rise of authoritarianism was under way before the pandemic hit last year, and it’s unlikely to recede after the virus wanes.<br />Latin America suffers from too much government. Taxation, regulation, weak property rights and corruption conspire against entrepreneurship and self-discovery. Yet in the 1980s most of the region returned to democracy, giving the struggle for liberty a fighting chance. That chance is slipping away. In the past two decades, the institutions necessary to ensure political and ideological competition have been destroyed in several countries."
