    "body": "A Chicago Tribune headline declares: “Experts warn of brutal flu season.” Of course. With never-ending lockdowns (in California especially), working from home, and even people alone in cars wearing masks, we’ve probably lost immunity to many illnesses—and patience for many former day-to-day annoyances.<br />I hate to break it to you, but with last week’s news that booster shots reduce the severity of the Omicron variant and the success of Paxlovid,  Pfizer ’s  new antiviral pill, it’s back to the office in 2022 for most of us. But are we again vulnerable to a host of diseases, plus many inconveniences we’ve long forgotten? Life moves pretty fast. I don’t know if most folks are ready."
