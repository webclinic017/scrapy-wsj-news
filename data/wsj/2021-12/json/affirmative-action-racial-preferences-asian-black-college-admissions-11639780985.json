    "body": "William McGurn’s “Biden’s ‘Yes’ to Racial Preferences” (Main Street, Dec. 14) miscues the moorings and inclusionary purposes of Supreme Court jurisprudence favoring universities’ delayed ending of their preferences accorded to white and other “entitled” applicants. That not all the Asians qualified for admission to professional schools and elite colleges get in is beside the point. The same may be said of many students of all hues who feel themselves “victimized” by others’ admission ahead of them.<br />Admitting the arrogant is not the goal of higher-education admissions professionals. Rather, admission to the elite, most competitive schools has broader, more expansive societal and higher-education goals—including that of reversing the decades-old preferences that were accorded to whites and disadvantaged and effectively excluded qualified blacks and Hispanics from the ranks of the best and brightest."
