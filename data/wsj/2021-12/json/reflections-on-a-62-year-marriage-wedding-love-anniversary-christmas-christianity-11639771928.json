    "body": "It’s the Christmas season, a time of hope and love. I’ve been reflecting on this as the 62nd anniversary of my wedding to my wife, Kay, approaches. When people introduce me at a public event, they often mention how long I’ve been married, and the listeners always applaud. My thought when this happens is: Isn’t that the way marriage is supposed to work? But perhaps marriage doesn’t always look that way these days, and after some reminiscing, Kay and I thought that some readers might enjoy our story—since, fitting the season, it is a story of hope and love.<br />My family moved to Tulsa, Okla., when I was 6. We lived about three houses away from Kay, who was 4. We grew up friends, never once thinking we’d date or have any sort of romance together. Then, when I was 25, I thought to myself: She’s been here all this time, and I didn’t know it. Who else would I ever want to marry? That was quite a thought for a 25-year-old. She was, and still is, unlike any other person I have ever met. Our engagement came soon after our first date."
