    "body": "Polish President Andrzej Duda vetoed a controversial media law Monday following protests around the country and criticism from the U.S. This was the right call on economic and security grounds.<br />The bill, passed this month, would have denied broadcast licenses to companies with even indirect majority ownership outside the European Economic Area (EEA). This would have forced the U.S. conglomerate Discovery to sell its stake in TVN, which it owns through a Dutch company. The channelâ€™s news division is highly critical of the Polish government."
