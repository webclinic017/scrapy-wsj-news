    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Trump’s final White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, indicated to the House panel investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol that he would no longer cooperate with its probe, prompting the panel to renew its threat to recommend holding him in criminal contempt of Congress.<br />Mr. Meadows had been scheduled to appear for a deposition on Wednesday. “If indeed Mr. Meadows refuses to appear, the select committee will be left no choice but to advance contempt proceedings and recommend that the body in which Mr. Meadows once served refer him for criminal prosecution,” Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D., Miss.) and Vice Chair Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.) said in a statement Tuesday."
