    "body": "A recently announced U.S. regulatory inquiry into split-payment services has spooked investors, with shares of players such as  Affirm Holdings  and  Afterpay  down sharply in some recent sessions. But investors need to react less now, and more later.<br />The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Thursday asked several “buy now, pay later,” or BNPL, providers for information related to some concerns it has about short-term installment plans. Its concerns included some typical consumer-protection issues, such as whether customers are clear about when payments are scheduled and policies around late fees."
