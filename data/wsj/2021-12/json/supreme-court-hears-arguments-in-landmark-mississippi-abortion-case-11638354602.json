    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the most significant abortion case in a generation Wednesday, one that antiabortion activists hope will lead the justices to abolish what a court majority in 1973 found to be women’s constitutional right to end unwanted pregnancies.<br />The court faced a similar crossroads in 1992, when, like today, the court’s personnel had been reshaped by Republican presidents who opposed abortion rights. But instead of overruling Roe v. Wade, a troika of Reagan and Bush appointees sought middle ground, curbing but not eliminating women’s power over their pregnancies. That opinion, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, allowed government to regulate abortion rights even before fetal viability so long as the restrictions didn’t impose an undue burden on women."
