    "body": "This year, my friend Thomas sent me “The Hound of Heaven,” asking whether I was familiar with English poet Francis Thompson’s ode to spiritual destiny. I told him I was, and we exchanged thoughts on the 1893 poem’s tragic beauty.<br />I thought I had grasped the essence of the poem: God, the Hound of Heaven, pursues us, and we, in our brokenness, resist. But weeks later, after hearing a homily during Mass celebrated by a visiting priest, I realized how little of the masterpiece I understood."
