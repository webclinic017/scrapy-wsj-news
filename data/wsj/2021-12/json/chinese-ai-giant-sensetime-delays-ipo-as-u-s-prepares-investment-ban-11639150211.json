    "body": "Chinese artificial-intelligence company  SenseTime Group Inc.  is trying to keep its initial public offering alive, according to a person familiar with the matter, as the Biden administration adds the company to a blacklist that will ban American investors from buying its shares.<br />On Friday, the pricing of SenseTime’s stock offering in Hong Kong didn’t take place as previously scheduled, thwarting the company’s plans to go public in a week’s time on Dec. 17. Companies going public in the city usually price their IPOs one week before the shares start trading, and investors who have placed orders don’t wire the money until the price is set."
