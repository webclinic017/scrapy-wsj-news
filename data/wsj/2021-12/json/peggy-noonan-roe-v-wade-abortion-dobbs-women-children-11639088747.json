    "body": "Regarding Peggy Noonan’s “Will the Justices Let Go of Abortion?” (Declarations, Dec. 4): I was a nurse in the 1960s, before Roe v. Wade (1973). Women who were desperate for abortions got them. Those who could afford it flew to countries where it was safe and legal. Those who couldn’t afford it went to underground abortionists, where many died. Others suffered complications so severe that they required hospital treatment. Overturning Roe would only hurt poor women.<br />Elise L. Lev"
