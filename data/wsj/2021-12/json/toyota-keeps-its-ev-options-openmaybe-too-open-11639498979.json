    "body": "Toyota Motor  Corp.  is getting more serious about all-electric vehicles, but not as serious as the likes of  Volkswagen  or  General Motors .  Some of its reasons for reticence are better than others.<br />On Tuesday, the world’s largest car maker by sales made a raft of new commitments to the propulsion technology popularized by  Tesla .  It is aiming to sell 3.5 million battery electric vehicles (BEVs) by 2030, up from 2 million previously forecast. It expects its luxury brand Lexus to be all-electric in China, North America and Europe by 2030. And a suite of new BEV models will follow Toyota’s flagship bZ4X, which will launch in the U.S. next year."
