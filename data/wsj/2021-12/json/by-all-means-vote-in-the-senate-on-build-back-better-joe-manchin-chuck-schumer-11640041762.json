    "body": "So much for a new political direction. Democrats have taken Sen. Joe Manchin’s Sunday rejection of the Build Back Better Act as an opportunity not to rethink their agenda, but to dare the West Virginian to defy them on the Senate floor. We can hear Republicans reply: Be our guest.<br />“Senators should be aware that the Senate will, in fact, consider the Build Back Better Act, very early in the new year so that every Member of this body has the opportunity to make their position known on the Senate floor, not just on television,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday."
