    "body": "HONG KONG—China’s aviation authority instructed airlines on fixes to the Boeing 737 MAX required before it could fly again, bringing the currently banned plane one step closer to returning to the Chinese skies.<br />In an airworthiness directive released Thursday, the Civil Aviation Administration of China ordered certain software installation and a revision of the flight manual, among other changes. It didn’t specify when China would allow the flights to resume. China was the first to ground the plane in the wake of the second of two fatal MAX crashes in March 2019."
