    "body": "This story has no jingle bells, no red-nosed reindeer, no chestnuts roasting on an open fire. But it’s a Christmas tale all the same. It’s about a guy from Chicago, the better angels he brought out in others even at his most troubled self, and peace on earth to men of good will.<br />His name was Joe Slovinec. As an undergrad at Notre Dame in the late 1970s, Joe was consumed by Democratic politics—and he would later make unsuccessful runs from Chicago for Congress and from Washington for the Distict of Columbia Council. Joe’s closest buddies were his fellow denizens of Dillon Hall, home to previous luminaries from Heisman Trophy winner Paul Hornung, class of ’57, to former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, class of ’64."
