    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to consider its bid to end the Trump-era “Remain in Mexico” immigration policy, following legal setbacks that have forced the government to continue the program.<br />Formally called the Migrant Protection Protocols, the program bars asylum seekers from Central America from entering the U.S. while immigration courts consider their claims. President Biden campaigned against the policy, introduced by former President Donald Trump, and took steps to end it upon taking office, but Republican-led states including Texas and Missouri sued to force its continuation."
