    "body": "Too many Western leaders and celebrities apply a double standard when doing business with China, forgiving behavior from Beijing they’d deplore at home. Think the NBA’s LeBron James on Hong Kong, or BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on governance standards for business.<br />So it’s bracing, and welcome, to hear the Women’s Tennis Association hold to principle as it stands up for Peng Shuai, a Chinese tennis star who publicly accused a high-ranking Communist leader of sexual assault in a now-deleted social media post from November."
