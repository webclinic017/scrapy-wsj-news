    "body": "Say this much for  Oracle  Corp. : When they get a line of credit, they waste no time in using it.<br />The line of credit in this case came from investors, who propelled the 44-year-old software company’s share price up nearly 16% following its fiscal second-quarter earnings report on Dec. 10. That brought the stock’s gains for the year to more than 60%, outperforming many of the younger and much-faster-growing cloud companies that are increasingly challenging Oracle’s storied enterprise software business."
