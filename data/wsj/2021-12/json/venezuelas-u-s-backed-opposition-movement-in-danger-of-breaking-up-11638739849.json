    "body": "The political movement the U.S. has backed in Venezuela to challenge the country’s authoritarian government is on the verge of breaking up after a major faction announced its withdrawal on Sunday.<br />Julio Borges, a leading figure in the antiregime coalition, called for an end to the leadership of Juan Guaidó, whom the U.S. and dozens of allies have backed as Venezuela’s legitimate president since January 2019 in a strategy to remove strongman President Nicolás Maduro. Until now, Mr. Guaidó has been leader of a movement that calls itself an interim government, complete with a bureaucracy and diplomats."
