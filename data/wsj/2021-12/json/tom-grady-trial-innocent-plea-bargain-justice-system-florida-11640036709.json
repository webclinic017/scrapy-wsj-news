    "body": "Last week I was a defendant in a criminal trial filed by the Biden administration’s partisan Justice Department. Innocence is small consolation when facing the asymmetric risk of battling the federal government, and the risk grows should a defendant dare exercise his constitutional right to trial (“The Unconstitutional Convictions You Don’t Know About” by Clark Neily and Somil Trivedi, op-ed, Dec. 13).<br />In an effort to extort a guilty plea, Justice’s bullying practices included threatening three separate felony charges in addition to the single misdemeanor, charged under a little used 120-year-old law against obstructing navigable waterways. Meritless or not, the mere filing of such charges would jeopardize my right to practice law and support my family—a fact well known to the government. But facts are stubborn things and I said no."
