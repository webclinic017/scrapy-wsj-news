    "body": "RJ Scaringe grew up studying the auto industry, peering under parked cars as a teenager and stashing spare parts around his bedroom. Now, at 38, he wants to disrupt it.<br />His electric-vehicle maker,  Rivian  Automotive Inc., represents a direct challenge to Detroit’s auto giants. Last month its initial public offering raised more money than any IPO on a U.S. listing since 2014, making Mr. Scaringe an instant billionaire. Its stock has rallied 47% since the IPO, pushing Rivian’s valuation higher than that of  Ford Motor Co.  or General Motors Co."
