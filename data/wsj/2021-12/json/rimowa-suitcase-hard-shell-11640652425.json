    "body": "For the Baggage Claim series, seasoned travelers unpack their devotion to a favorite piece of luggage or travel accessory.<br />THE BLACK-NYLON roller bag may still dominate most airport terminals, but fashionable fliers prefer their luggage a little shinier. The queen of the carousel, as far as I’m concerned, is the Rimowa.
