    "body": "Jason Furman thinks good intentions and a few tweaks will make an extension of the child tax credit desirable policy (“Democrats Can Tweak Their Child Allowance to Help Families More,” op-ed, Dec. 18). On the contrary, tax credits should be avoided in general because they are arbitrary and discriminatory.<br />Mr. Furman argues that extending the credit would result in a large reduction in child poverty, but so would doubling or tripling the benefit. There is no limiting principle here. Past increases in the credit and the expansion of eligibility well into the middle-class already make it a textbook example of how entitlements become entrenched and grow well beyond their original boundaries."
