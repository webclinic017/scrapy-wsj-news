    "body": "The Covid testing policies in professional sports are broken (“NFL vs. Covid Magical Thinking” by Holman Jenkins, Business World, Dec. 22). Worse than that, they aren’t making athletes any safer. Roughly 95% of NFL players, 97% of NBA players and nearly 100% of NHL athletes are vaccinated for Covid. Those numbers are substantially in excess of the national vaccination rate. Yet the NFL, NBA and NHL are all setting league records for positive cases.<br />How is this possible? Athletes, and all of us, were told that if everyone were vaccinated, Covid cases would plunge and we could return to normal life. Yet there were more U.S. Covid cases on Dec. 24, 2021, than there were on Dec. 24, 2020."
