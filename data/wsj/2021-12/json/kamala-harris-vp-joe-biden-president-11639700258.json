    "body": "Peggy Noonan’s analysis of the problems facing the vice president is insightful (“Kamala Harris Needs to Get Serious,” Declarations, Dec. 11). But she stops short of assigning blame to the person who chose Ms. Harris for the job. Then-candidate Joe Biden believed that an all-white, all-male Democratic ticket could not win. He announced that he would pick a woman as his running mate, and, as former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid speculated, “He came to the conclusion that he should pick a black woman.”<br />Instead of basing his decision on competency, leadership or experience, Mr. Biden was guided by gender identity and possibly racial identity. Ms. Harris now appears to be in over her head, but she didn’t choose the job. It was chosen for her by someone who abdicated his responsibility to pick a running mate ready to take over for him, should it be necessary."
