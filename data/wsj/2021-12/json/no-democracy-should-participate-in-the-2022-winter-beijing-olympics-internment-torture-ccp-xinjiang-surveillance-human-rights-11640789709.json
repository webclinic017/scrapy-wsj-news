    "body": "In advance of the 2022 Olympics this February, the Chinese Communist Party is on a campaign to whitewash its image. Plastering over the ever-growing list of human-rights abuses—including the takeover of Hong Kong, the internment of Muslims in Xinjiang, the disappearance of tennis star Peng Shuai, the Covid coverup and threats to democratic Taiwan—the party wields denial, obfuscation and cash. The latest campaign pushes the absurd claim that China enjoys democratic government at home while deriding as undemocratic the world’s real democracies.<br />The Communist Party shows no inhibition about spreading falsehoods in this new misinformation effort. Published last September, a government white paper broadly publicized in China claimed that the Chinese people “experience a broad, thorough and true democracy.” In October, Xi Jinping said China’s National People’s Congress “guarantees that the people are masters.” In other instances, Mr. Xi has claimed, that “when the people call out, I listen,” and dismissed American democracy, saying people “go into hibernation” after elections and otherwise have “no way to exercise their rights to speak.”"
