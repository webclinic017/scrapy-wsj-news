    "body": "I was checking to see how many websites were selling my latest book the other day when I noticed that  Amazon  listed me on Google in the following way: “Stephen Miller: Books, Biography, Blog, Audiobooks, Kindle.” Blog? I’ve never blogged in my life. I don’t even have a website. I do have a  Twitter  account, but I have tweeted maybe 10 times in seven years and have only seven followers. What are they following?<br />Should I make more of an effort to create more advertisements for myself? I’m not a recluse who hates publicity. Fifteen years ago I enjoyed a few minutes of fame from a book I wrote on conversation. I appeared on “CBS Sunday Morning” and radio shows on three continents. At the Melbourne Writers Festival I was interviewed by Robert Dessaix, a leading Australian writer, in a packed theater about the art of conversation."
