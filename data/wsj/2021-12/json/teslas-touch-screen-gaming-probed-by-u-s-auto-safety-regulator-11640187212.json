    "body": "The top U.S. auto-safety regulator has opened an investigation into a  Tesla Inc.  feature that allows people—including the driver—to play games on a touch screen while the vehicle is in motion.<br />The ability to play games while driving has been available for roughly a year in some vehicles and “may distract the driver and increase the risk of a crash,” the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a document made public Wednesday. The feature previously was only enabled while vehicles were in park, the agency said, adding it launched the probe to evaluate the potential for driver distraction."
