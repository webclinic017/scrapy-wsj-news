    "body": "I agree with your principal argument that the Constitution is silent on abortion and therefore its regulation is best left to the states (“An Abortion Crossroads,” Review & Outlook, Dec. 1). Most legal minds, on both sides of the debate, agree that the constitutional basis for Roe v. Wade (1973) is questionable at best.<br />But the notion that Americans will see the Supreme Court in a less political light should it overturn Roe is misplaced. The majority of Americans are interested in the ends, not the means, and the end of Roe is that abortion is legal. The end of Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) was Jim Crow. The constitutional foundation—or lack thereof—of either case is irrelevant to most people."
