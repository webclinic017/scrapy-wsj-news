    "body": "Chinese history plays out in cycles, or so goes the well-worn cliché.

Europe, with its big exposure to Chinese spending on luxury goods and industrial equipment, appears to be at greater risk of collateral damage than the U.S. And in a bracing bit of déjà vu,  Kaisa Group Holdings —the first Chinese real-estate developer to default on offshore debt way back in 2014—looks poised to do so again."
