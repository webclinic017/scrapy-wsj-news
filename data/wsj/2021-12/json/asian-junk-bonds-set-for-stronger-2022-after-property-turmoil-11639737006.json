    "body": "After this year’s punishing selloff in Asian junk bonds, due largely to the turmoil in Chinese property, some investors and analysts are cautiously optimistic about the outlook for 2022.<br />Investors say Chinese authorities are likely to ease up somewhat on the embattled real-estate sector and to loosen monetary policy, helping support Chinese corporate borrowers more broadly. The People’s Bank of China last week cut banks’ reserve requirements, a move some economists said could signal the start of an easing cycle."
