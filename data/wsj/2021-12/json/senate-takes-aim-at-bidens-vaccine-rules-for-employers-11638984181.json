    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Senate is expected to pass legislation aimed at nullifying President Biden’s vaccine-or-test mandate for private employers, a move that would mark a significant bipartisan rebuke of the president even if lawmakers ultimately fall short of stopping the new Covid-19 rule.<br />All Senate Republicans and Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana have said they would support the legislation, making at least 52 senators expected to vote in favor of rejecting the rule. The vote is expected later Wednesday."
