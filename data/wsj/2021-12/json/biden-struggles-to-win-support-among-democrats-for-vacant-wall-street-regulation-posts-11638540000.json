    "body": "WASHINGTON—The White House’s desire to appease both liberal and moderate Democrats has left several top Wall Street regulatory posts unfilled, slowing the implementation of President Biden’s agenda nearly a year into the administration.<br />The president’s pick for comptroller of the currency, Saule Omarova, has drawn resistance from moderates, such as Sen. Jon Tester (D., Mont.). Mr. Biden’s renomination of Jerome Powell for Federal Reserve chairman was met with opposition from Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and other liberals. And, in what could be viewed as an olive branch, Mr. Biden is considering nominating Richard Cordray, an ally of Ms. Warren, for the Fed’s top supervisory position."
