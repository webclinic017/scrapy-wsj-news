    "body": "The momentum toward educational choice is undeniable. This year has seen unprecedented state-level expansion of educational opportunities for millions of families across the country, with 18 states passing legislation to introduce or expand educational choice programs—a trend that’s primed to continue through the 2022 election cycle. The recent electoral success of choice supporters in Virginia and New Jersey—traditional strongholds for special-interest groups that strongly oppose choice—coupled with school-board elections driven by parents wanting a voice in their kids’ classrooms, is emboldening states to expand educational options.<br />It also turns out that school choice programs save taxpayer dollars, removing another huge policy barrier."
