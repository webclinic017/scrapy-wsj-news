    "body": "The good news is that the Federal Reserve now recognizes that persistent high inflation threatens to overshadow the prospects for real economic growth. The bad news is that the Fed plans to continue buying Treasury debt and mortgage-backed securities while keeping interest rates near zero until mid-March.<br />Staying in monetary stimulus mode is the Fed’s way of trying to appease distressed consumers without roiling equity and bond markets. Chairman Jerome Powell last week sought to finesse that delicate trade-off by ratcheting up the rhetoric without taking any specific actions to contract the monetary base. The official statement issued by the Federal Open Market Committee—euphemistically called “forward guidance”—amounts to little more than posturing in the thin hope that elevated inflation rates will self-resolve in the coming months. If fiscal stimulus wanes and supply-chain bottlenecks clear, the Fed’s oft-stated determination to be “patient” before raising interest rates would seem vindicated."
