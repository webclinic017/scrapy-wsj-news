    "body": "With battles over school closures, vaccine mandates and curricula, you might think the president of the American Federation of Teachers has enough on her plate. But Randi Weingarten is now lobbying hard for a tax break whose benefits would go mostly to the wealthy. She wants Democrats to restore the deduction for state and local taxes in their giant tax and spending bill.<br />That’s not how Ms. Weingarten is selling it. “SALT is a way of delivering for the middle class,” she tweeted last week. At a press conference Wednesday outside the Capitol with the Bipartisan SALT Caucus, the teachers union chief repeated this theme."
