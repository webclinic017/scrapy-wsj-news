    "body": "In “San Franciscans Get What They Voted for With Chesa Boudin” (Cross Country, Nov. 27), Michael Shellenberger mentions that the San Francisco district attorney had campaigned in part on lenient handling of “victimless crimes.” Among those crimes he considered “victimless” were open drug use. For me, this recalled an incident some years ago involving a client.<br />This sweet lady had a son deeply involved in drug abuse. He was unable to keep a job. He was unable to support himself but he could get his hands on drugs. One night, his drug-use buddies, while partaking in their “victimless” endeavors, saw him overdose. They loaded him in their car—I have to give them credit for that, at least—and drove him to a local hospital’s emergency-room entrance. They pulled in, opened the car door, pushed him out onto the asphalt and sped off."
