    "body": "Airlines continued to scrub flights Saturday as Covid-19 infections hit pilots and flight attendants, leaving carriers short-staffed to operate busy schedules over the Christmas holiday weekend.<br />Airlines have canceled close to 900 U.S. flights so far Saturday after canceling nearly 700 on Friday. Travel snarls could continue as people head home from holidaysâ€”airlines have called off over 200 flights scheduled for Sunday, according to FlightAware, a flight-tracking site. Some European airlines and rail operators are also grappling with higher rates of illness among employees, in the latest sign of how the rapidly spreading Omicron variant is upending business even in industries with heavily vaccinated workforces."
