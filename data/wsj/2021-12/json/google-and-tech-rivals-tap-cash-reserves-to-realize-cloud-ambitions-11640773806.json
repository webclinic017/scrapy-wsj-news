    "body": "Google and its rivals are wielding a new weapon in the battle for cloud-computing market share: big-dollar investments in companies that agree to sign on to their services.<br />With Thomas Kurian serving as cloud chief executive since 2019 after a long tenure at  Oracle Corp. , the  Alphabet Inc.  unit has been tapping its $142 billion treasure chest of cash to make it more attractive to customers.
