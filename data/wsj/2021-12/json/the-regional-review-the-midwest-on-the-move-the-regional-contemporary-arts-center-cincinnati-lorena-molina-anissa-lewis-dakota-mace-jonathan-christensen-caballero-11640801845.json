    "body": "Cincinnati<br />This isn’t your grandfather’s Midwest anymore. The art that emanates from it these days seems to have little to do with grassy plains, silos, or the kind of folk in Grant Wood paintings. That’s certainly not a complaint about “The Regional,” a survey of new art from—as a press release puts it—“the area that stretches from the Dakotas to Ohio, and from Minnesota to Missouri,” just a descriptive fact. The exhibition includes the work of 23 “emerging and midcareer” artists from 14 Midwestern cities; it’s on view at the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati through March 20, 2022, after which it travels to the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art in Kansas City, Mo."
