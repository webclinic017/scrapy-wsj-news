    "body": "Growing up in small-town Wisconsin in the 1970s, I was raised on the gritty gospel of revered Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi, who famously said: “Winners never quit and quitters never win.” This mind-set propelled me to an academic golf scholarship, and I was confident I would be a pro golfer. But then something unexpected happened in my freshman year: I took an honest look at my game, meticulously compared my stats with those of my peers, and realized I would never be good enough to make a living as a pro. I wondered whether I should quit on my dream.<br />I played for the rest of college, even becoming a two-time Academic All-American athlete, but I gave up on the idea of ever playing professionally. This was an agonizing decision that went against my upbringing. But I’m lucky I quit, because I found another calling, one that I did turn out to have an above-the-curve talent for: economics. Decades later, my work as an economist has convinced me that good old Vince got it wrong. People don’t quit enough."
