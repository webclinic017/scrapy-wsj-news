    "body": "Global Infrastructure Management LLC has agreed to pay a $4.5 million penalty to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges involving fees and expenses it passed on to investors in at least two of its funds.<br />The New York firm which sponsors the Global Infrastructure Partners investment funds failed to properly offset management fees and made misleading statements about the costs charged to investors in its first and third flagship pools, the agency said in an administrative complaint. It said the investors wound up overpaying the firm as a result from periods starting in December 2009 and running through March 2019."
