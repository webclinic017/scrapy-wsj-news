    "body": "‘I have found that a surprising amount of history can becontained in a simple cup,” Robert Hellyer writes in “Green With Milk and Sugar,” his heady brew of the intertwined history of green tea in Japan, the United States and his own family.<br />Mr. Hellyer, an associate professor of history at Wake Forest University, comes by his interest in tea through his paternal forebears’ long involvement in Japanese tea production and export to America, beginning with his English-born great-great grandfather Frederick Hellyer in the late 1860s. Frederick, like succeeding generations of Hellyers, came to divide his time between Riverside, Ill., and the family’s tea-processing factories in the Japanese port cities of Kobe and Shizuoka."
