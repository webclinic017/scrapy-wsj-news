    "body": "The art of the Rococo was not merely supposed to be fun (“Icons: Disney Knows Rococo,” Review, Nov. 27); it is frequently suggestive, intended for the private delectation of adult viewers. Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s painting “The Swing,” illustrated in the article as inspiration for scenes in  Disney  movies, was commissioned by a patron who requested the artist to depict him looking up his mistress’s frothy pink dress, as she was pushed on the swing by an elderly bishop.<br />Fragonard was happy to oblige: He shows the patron reclining in the corner, his arm outstretched toward the object of his affection. Above him a grisaille putto holds his fingers to his lips, indicating the secret nature of the encounter. The young woman kicks off her silken mule slipper, a motif for sexual freedom."
