    "body": "No one said China’s economic pivot from real estate would be easy, and now along come more data to prove the point. It’s clearer by the day that China’s economy is under growing pressure, which means so is President Xi Jinping.<br />A range of numbers released Wednesday paint a gloomy picture. Growth in retail sales slowed to 3.9% year-on-year in November, down from 4.9% in October. Growth in fixed-asset investment was 5.2% for the January-November period, compared to 6.1% for January-October, implying a slowing pace during the most recent month."
