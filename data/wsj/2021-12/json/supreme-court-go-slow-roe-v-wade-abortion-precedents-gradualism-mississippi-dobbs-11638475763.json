    "body": "Should the Supreme Court eliminate all constitutional abortion rights? That question dominated oral argument in Dobbs v. Jackson Womenâ€™s Health Organization on Wednesday. Opponents of abortion have urged the court to overrule almost 50 years of precedents, including Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992).<br />Such a sweeping decision would be both precipitous and out of character. The justices typically move gradually before issuing disruptive decisions, and that approach is especially warranted in Dobbs."
