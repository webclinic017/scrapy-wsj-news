    "body": "President Biden’s planned talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday is part of a pressure tactic the Russian leader is using to try to redraw post-Cold War arrangements in Europe, current and former U.S. officials said.<br />The call is likely to center on Russia’s demands that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization sever support for Ukraine and U.S. concerns about a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine. The call comes at the request of Mr. Putin, giving him a chance to talk directly with Mr. Biden before their negotiators meet for a series of talks next month."
