    "body": "TOKYO—Japan’s central bank kept its monetary policy ultraloose and expressed minimal concern about inflation, joining continental Europe in showing that recent tightening in the U.S. doesn’t necessarily represent a global phenomenon.<br />The  Bank of Japan  on Friday maintained its target for short-term interest rates at minus 0.1% and said it would continue guiding the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds to around zero, well below the U.S. where equivalent government bonds are yielding more than 1.4%."
