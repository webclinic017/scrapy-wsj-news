    "body": "The best hope for Omicron goes like this: If it spreads more easily, big deal. The virus is already everywhere. If it’s also milder, hooray. This is the thing that matters now. As it spreads to the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike, let’s protect the most vulnerable while accepting that Omicron will boost population resistance and contribute to reducing Covid to a mostly non-life-threatening nuisance.<br />In this phase of the pandemic, think of hospitalizations as the residual. The virus is in a race with immunity. If one gets a little ahead of the other, hospitalizations increase or decrease. Adjust, of course, for the fact that vaccination in this race is worth approximately 65 times as much in a person over 65 than in a person under 30 in terms of preventing death."
