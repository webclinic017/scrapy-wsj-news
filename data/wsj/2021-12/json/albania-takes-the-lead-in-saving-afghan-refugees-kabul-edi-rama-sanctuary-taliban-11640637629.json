    "body": "Shëngjin, Albania<br />Four months after the last American troops left Kabul, Washington remains haunted by its retreat from Afghanistan—and the knowledge the crises now convulsing that country are unlikely to stay contained there. Yet if there is a hopeful story to emerge anywhere from this year’s Afghan calamity, it might be here in the Western Balkans—a region that a generation ago was hemorrhaging refugees but that stepped forward last summer as an unexpected haven for those fleeing the Taliban. Leading the charge has been Edi Rama, Albania’s prime minister. Even before the fall of Kabul, Mr. Rama made the extraordinary decision to offer temporary sanctuary to at-risk Afghans with nowhere else to turn."
