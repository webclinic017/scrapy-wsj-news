    "body": "How you celebrate New Year’s Eve can reveal a lot. Extroverts revel in party and song. Homebodies remain home as balls drop and corks pop. When it comes to presidents, their Dec. 31 habits have often reflected their character and that of their presidencies.<br />George W. Bush is a good example. When asked by reporters in late 2004 about his New Year’s plans, Mr. Bush replied laconically, “Early to bed.” His father spent New Year’s Eve 1989 visiting wounded U.S. soldiers who had liberated Panama from Manuel Noriega’s dictatorship."
