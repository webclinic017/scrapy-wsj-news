    "body": "Michelle Bethel is right that U.S. research relationships with institutions in China require serious care and consideration (“Is MIT’s Research Helping the Chinese Military?” op-ed, Dec. 11). But her assertions about the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT are misplaced.<br />MIT has strong processes for evaluating risks of research involving countries, like China, whose behavior has particular importance for U.S. national and economic security. Every proposed engagement is evaluated for compliance with U.S. law and regulation, and is then reviewed for risks related to national security, economic competitiveness and civil and human rights."
