    "body": "Economic sanctions don’t work, the truism goes, but sanctions are good at what they’re supposed to do, imposing a cost for unwelcome behavior. A Vladimir Putin wouldn’t act as he does if he weren’t willing to pay the price, but the U.S. and its allies are still better off making him pay it.<br />The question is, should we be asking more from sanctions. Victoria Nuland, a top State Department official, said in an interview this week: “We have not been shy in the past about our sanctions with regard to folks close to President Putin and to things that matter to him.”"
