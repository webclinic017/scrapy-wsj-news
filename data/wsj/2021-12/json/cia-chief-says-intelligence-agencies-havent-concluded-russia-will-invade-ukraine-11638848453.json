    "body": "WASHINGTON—U. S. intelligence agencies haven’t concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin will invade Ukraine, but he has assembled military forces that “could act in a very sweeping way” and may see an opportunity to move this winter, CIA Director William Burns said Monday.<br />“I would never underestimate President Putin’s risk appetite on Ukraine,” Mr. Burns said at The Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council Summit. He noted remarks Mr. Putin has made that Moscow should have significant influence over Ukraine, a neighbor."
