    "body": "Inflation was a Grinch this Christmas. Economists on Team Transitory, myself included, should admit that we never thought inflation would go this high. What happened? Does high inflation still look transitory?<br />First, the startlingly high 6.8% inflation rate reported by the consumer-price index over the past year exaggerates the problem. A better measure, the one on which the Federal Reserve focuses, is called the deflator for core personal-consumption expenditures, or core PCE. This price index excludes food and energy, because they are so volatile and far beyond the Fed’s control. It registered a 4.7% inflation rate over the past year."
