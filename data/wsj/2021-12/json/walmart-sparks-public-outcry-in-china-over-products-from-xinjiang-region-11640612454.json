    "body": "Walmart Inc., the world’s largest retailer, became the latest Western company to face scrutiny over its handling of business involving Xinjiang, following the passage of a U.S. law that virtually bans all imports from the northwestern Chinese region over forced labor and human rights concerns.<br />The Bentonville, Ark.-based retailer attracted anger on Chinese social media beginning last week after internet users shared comments that purported to show that Walmart had stopped stocking products from Xinjiang in their China-based Walmart and Sam’s Club stores. Some said they had canceled their Sam’s Club membership, while social-media accounts run by Communist Party-backed entities weighed in to criticize the company."
