    "body": "A Justice Department lawyer argued Friday that the U.S. should be permitted to represent Donald Trump in a defamation lawsuit filed by the columnist E. Jean Carroll, saying the law protects a president from being sued in such a case.<br />In the 2019 lawsuit, Ms. Carroll alleged Mr. Trump lied earlier that year when he denied raping her in the dressing room of the Bergdorf Goodman department store in the 1990s."
