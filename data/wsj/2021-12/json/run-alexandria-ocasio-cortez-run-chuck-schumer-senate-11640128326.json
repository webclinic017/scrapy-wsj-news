    "body": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the celebrated progressive, is very unhappy with Joe Manchin and the U.S. Senate these days.<br />“It is unconscionable the way the Senate operates. It’s fundamentally undemocratic,” she said Monday after Sen. Manchin had announced his opposition to the Build Back Better Act. “What we really need to do is crack down on the Senate, which operates like an old boys’ club that has a couple of gals in it that have managed to break through.”"
