    "body": "Stitch Fix  is about as polarizing to investors right now as low rise jeans are to consumers.<br />The online styling company reported solid earnings Tuesday for the period ended Oct. 30, with revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization coming in above Wall Street’s estimates. But active clients of just 4.18 million disappointed investors—growing just 15,000 versus a quarter earlier. Furthermore, top-line guidance for the quarter ending Jan. 29 missed analysts’ forecast by 12% at the midpoint and, despite three consecutive quarters of Ebitda profits, Stitch Fix suggested it could lose money even on an Ebitda basis for that period."
