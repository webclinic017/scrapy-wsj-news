    "body": "WASHINGTON—Nearly a year after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters, Americans are divided over how serious it was, who is to blame and the punishments that have been imposed, underscoring the broader polarization facing the country and fanning concerns about the state of the democracy.<br />A recent Quinnipiac poll found that 93% of Democrats and 56% of independents considered it an attack on the government, while only 29% of Republicans said the same. A Pew Research Center poll showed a declining share of Republicans who believe it is important that rioters be prosecuted, with 57% expressing support in September, down from 79% in March—while Democrats were steady at 95%."
