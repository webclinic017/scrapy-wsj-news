    "body": "Regarding Arnold Punaro’s op-ed “America Repeated Vietnam’s Mistakes in Afghanistan” (Nov. 24): America was defeated in Vietnam and Afghanistan for a simple reason: It’s next to impossible to win when your adversary has a safe harbor in an adjacent country. In Vietnam, we tried to deter the North Vietnamese by air power. This failed. In Afghanistan, we did little to deter the Pakistanis from providing the Taliban refuge and weapons.<br />The American unwillingness to expand the war in both cases led to defeat. As a junior officer in the early days of the Vietnam War, I remember discussions about why it was imperative to attack the North Vietnamese. “Go north or go home” was voiced by more than one of my shipmates."
