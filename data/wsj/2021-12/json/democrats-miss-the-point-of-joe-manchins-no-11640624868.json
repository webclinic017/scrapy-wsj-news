    "body": "The Democrats were shocked when Sen. Joe Manchin stated that he couldn’t support the current Build Back Better bill. For months it was known that he was concerned over its cost and effect on inflation, and he had repeatedly said he didn’t like budget gimmicks (“Taking Joe Manchin Seriously,” Review & Outlook, Dec. 17).<br />The shock is really that Mr. Manchin, unlike many of his colleagues, said what he meant and meant what he said; that he was an honest, principled man rather than a political lemming ready to follow progressive ideologues over the cliff."
