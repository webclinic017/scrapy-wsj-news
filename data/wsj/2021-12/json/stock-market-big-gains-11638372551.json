    "body": "Despite the continuing pandemic and global jitters about everything from climate change to inflation, the good times have kept rolling in the markets during 2021. The U.S. stock market continued to soar across the board—large-cap, small-cap, growth, value—seemingly every segment of the stock market just kept going up.<br />But the past isn’t prologue, so the question for investors is now: Can these good times last in the years ahead? In short, not likely. Given where the markets have been and where they are now, it’s critical that investors have realistic expectations for future market returns."
