    "body": "DUBAI—Mounia Touhami used to love working Sundays, the first day of the workweek in the United Arab Emirates. The U.S. and Europe were off for the weekend, and the financier had a quiet day to get things done.<br />Now, her adopted country is switching to match the rest of the world with a Monday to Friday week, starting Jan. 1.
