    "body": "Pope Francis visited a refugee camp in Greece on the frontier of Europe’s migration routes and called on the continent to welcome people seeking asylum from war and other humanitarian disasters.<br />“I ask every man and woman, all of us, to overcome the paralysis of fear, the indifference that kills, the cynical disregard that nonchalantly condemns to death those on the fringes,” the pope said on Sunday morning, during a visit to the center on the Greek island of Lesbos, which houses more than 2,000 refugees and migrants from Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa."
