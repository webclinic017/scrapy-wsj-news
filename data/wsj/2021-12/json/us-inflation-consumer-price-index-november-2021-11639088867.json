    "body": "U.S. inflation likely reached a nearly four-decade high in November, as strong consumer demand collided with pandemic-related supply constraints.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimate the Labor Department will report the consumer-price index—which measures what consumers pay for goods and services—rose 6.7% in November from the same month a year ago. That would mark the fastest pace since 1982 and the sixth straight month in which inflation topped 5%."
