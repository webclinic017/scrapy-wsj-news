    "body": "Sian Proctor’s journey to space began in 1970, when she was born to a father who worked at a NASA tracking station during the Apollo program. She grew up in a home filled with NASA memorabilia and dreamed of becoming a fighter pilot so she could later be an astronaut.<br />That dream was derailed a couple of times. First, when she discovered in her teens that she needed eyeglasses. So, instead of joining the Air Force, she became a geology professor. Then, in 2009, though she was a finalist in the competition, she was turned down for NASA’s astronaut training program."
