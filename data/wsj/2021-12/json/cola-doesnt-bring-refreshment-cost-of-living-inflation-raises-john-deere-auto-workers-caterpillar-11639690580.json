    "body": "John Deere agreed to resurrect a 1970s-era benefit in its labor agreement with the United Auto Workers last month. The wages of the company’s union workers will be directly tied to the consumer-price index, and cost-of-living adjustments will help insulate union members from the negative effects of inflation.<br />The rediscovery of these adjustments could be a harbinger. But John Deere uniquely may be able to pass labor cost increases on to its customers. The company boasted it was able to raise prices 8% on large farm equipment during its most recent fiscal year. It isn’t clear whether other industrial companies plan to follow John Deere’s lead, but for those contemplating a similar move, allow me to share a cautionary tale."
