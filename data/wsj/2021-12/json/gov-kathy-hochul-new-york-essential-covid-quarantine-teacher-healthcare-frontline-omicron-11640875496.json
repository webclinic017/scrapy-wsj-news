    "body": "Gov. Kathy Hochul announced on Christmas Eve that people whose jobs New York state deems unimportant must stay home and quarantine for 10 days if they test positive for Covid-19. Others are free to return to work five days earlier. The state Health Department described its guidance as allowing for a shortened quarantine for “Healthcare Workers and Other Critical Workforce.” But the meaning is the same: People will be confined to their homes not based solely on their risk of contagion but also on the government’s perception of their social or economic value.<br />Throughout the pandemic, politicians have exhorted the public to “follow the science.” Courts have generally deferred to public-health decrees that greatly restrict individual liberty—on the assumption that they are grounded in epidemiological considerations. Such factors include the disease’s incubation period, its severity and the immunity of the exposed person. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week said that quarantine beyond five days is unnecessary for any vaccinated person."
