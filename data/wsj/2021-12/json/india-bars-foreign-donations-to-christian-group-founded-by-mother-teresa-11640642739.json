    "body": "NEW DELHI—India’s government said it would bar donations from foreign donors to a Christian missionary group founded by the late Mother Teresa, threatening an important source of funding for the group’s programs to help impoverished Indians.<br />India’s Ministry of Home Affairs said it delivered the rejection on Christmas Day. Authorities said they found unspecified “adverse inputs” when renewing the Missionaries of Charity’s application and said the group no longer met eligibility requirements under the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act."
