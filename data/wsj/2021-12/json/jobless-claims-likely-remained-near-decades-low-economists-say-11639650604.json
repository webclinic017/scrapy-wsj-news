    "body": "New applications for unemployment benefits likely edged higher last week but stayed very low, reflecting an unusually tight labor market as the economy continued to recover.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimated that initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, inched up to 195,000 for the week that ended Dec. 11 from 184,000—the lowest level in 52 years—the week before. Some economists attributed that half-century low to seasonal adjustments being thrown off because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Still, new jobless claims have been steadily declining throughout the year."
