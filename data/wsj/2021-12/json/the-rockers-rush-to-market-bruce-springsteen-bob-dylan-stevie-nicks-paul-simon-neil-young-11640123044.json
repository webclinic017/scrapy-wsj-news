    "body": "<br />This past Thursday, Sony Music confirmed that it had purchased Bruce Springsteen’s recorded music and publishing catalog. The price of the sale—which transfers ownership of both the Boss’s master recordings, i.e. his performances as found on his records, and publishing rights to the songs he has written—was reported to be about $550 million. It was the most recent—and, by some measures, most lucrative—instance of a high-profile, late-career artist selling the rights to his or her songs. Other notable examples from the past 12 months, which were reported to be worth between $50 million and $400 million, include Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Neil Young, ZZ Top and Stevie Nicks (her onetime Fleetwood Mac bandmate Lindsey Buckingham sold his songs too, price unknown). And negotiations for the sale of song catalogs of Sting and David Bowie are rumored to be in the works."
