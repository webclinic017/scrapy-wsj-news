    "body": "Elizabeth Holmes dropped out of Stanford University at 19 years old to start the company that became Theranos Inc., a startup that promised to revolutionize the blood-testing industry. After operating largely in secret for a decade, Theranos began in 2013 publicizing its technology, which it said could test for more than 200 health conditions with a few drops of blood extracted from a finger prick, eliminating the need for large needles and vials of blood. The companyâ€™s valuation eventually reached more than $9 billion.<br />The Wall Street Journal began reporting on questions about Theranos in 2015, revealing that only a few tests could be performed on its proprietary technology and that most were being run on off-the-shelf machines, including some that Theranos altered to work with diluted finger-prick samples."
