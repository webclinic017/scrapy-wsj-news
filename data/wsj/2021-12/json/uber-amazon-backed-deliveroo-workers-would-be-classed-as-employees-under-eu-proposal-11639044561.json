    "body": "Uber Technologies Inc.,   Amazon . com Inc.-backed  Deliveroo  PLC and other gig-economy companies could be forced to give more benefits to their drivers and delivery personnel under a European Union proposal that would reclassify many of their jobs as employment.<br />The draft bill, proposed Thursday by the EUâ€™s executive arm, would establish a presumption that many of the companies in what is often called the gig economy actually employ workers, depending on the level of control the companies exercise over how workers perform their jobs. Until now, most such companies have deemed the majority of their workers to be independent contractors."
