    "body": "Long before Eric Zemmour announced his candidacy for president of France, English-language publications were comparing him to Donald Trump: a provocateur on the far right with hard-line views on immigration; a well-known TV personality with no previous governing experience, whose success in the polls surprised established politicians.<br />The comparison is convenient but facile. Messrs. Zemmour and Trump emerged from different political traditions and appeal to very different sensibilities."
