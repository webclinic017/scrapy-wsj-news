    "body": "Twitter  co-founder Jack Dorsey’s resignation letter included some parting words of caution: Being “founder-led,” he wrote, can be “severely limiting and a single point of failure” for a business.<br />The advice probably fell on deaf ears. As Mr. Dorsey wrote: “There aren’t many founders who choose their company over their own ego.” And, in another sign that irony is dead, he remains chief executive of payments company  Square  Inc.,  soon to be known as Block, which he co-founded in 2009. But investors aren’t bound by the same hubris. Should they be cautious about buying into companies where a founder might have stayed too long at the party?"
