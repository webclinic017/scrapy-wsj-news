    "body": "WASHINGTON—Conservative justices Wednesday appeared skeptical of Maine’s secondary education system for rural areas that lack public schools, because the state provides parents tuition vouchers for private schools with nonsectarian curricula but excludes those that teach subjects through a religious lens.<br />The court’s ideological divide was evident in its last oral argument of 2021, in which members of the conservative majority suggested the Maine program amounted to simple discrimination against religion, while liberal justices expressed doubt that the Constitution compelled taxpayers to subsidize teaching religious dogma."
