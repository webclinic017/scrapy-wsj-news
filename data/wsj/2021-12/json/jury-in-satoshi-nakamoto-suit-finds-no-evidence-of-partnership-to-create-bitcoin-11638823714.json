    "body": "A Florida jury rejected claims that Craig Wright and David Kleiman formed a partnership to launch bitcoin, ending a high-profile case that revolved around the identity of the digital currency’s anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto and the disposition of a multibillion-dollar fortune.<br />The civil suit, filed by the family of Mr. Kleiman, now deceased, alleged that he and Mr. Wright formed a business partnership, called W&K Information Defense Research. As part of that partnership, they together created and launched bitcoin in 2008 and 2009, using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, the suit alleged."
