    "body": "The defense began presenting its case Thursday in the sex-trafficking trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, as her lawyers sought to undermine the accounts of accusers who testified the British socialite facilitated disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged sexual abuse.<br />Cimberly Espinosa, a former executive assistant to Ms. Maxwell, told the jury that while working in Epstein’s office she met the accuser identified as Jane, who earlier in the trial told the jury that Epstein began abusing her at age 14. She said Jane’s mother, who came to the office, identified Jane as the financier’s goddaughter."
