    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters asked to meet with Rep. Scott Perry after witnesses testified the lawmaker played a role in the failed attempt to install an attorney general who would pursue false claims of election fraud.<br />Mr. Perry, of Pennsylvania, was among a group of Republicans who objected to certifying the 2020 presidential-election results from a handful of states, advancing the debunked claims that former President Donald Trump had lost the states because of fraud. Mr. Perry led the objection to counting the votes from Pennsylvania and voted to object to results from Arizona. The committee said it wants to talk to Mr. Perry in late December or early January."
