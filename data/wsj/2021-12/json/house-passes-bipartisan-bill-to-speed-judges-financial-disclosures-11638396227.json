    "body": "WASHINGTON—Federal judges would have to speed disclosure of stock trades and publish their financial-disclosure reports online for the first time under a bipartisan bill overwhelmingly passed by the U.S. House Wednesday.<br />Democrats and Republicans championed the legislation after articles in The Wall Street Journal found hundreds of lawsuits were overseen by judges involving corporate litigants in which the judges themselves or their families had an ownership stake."
