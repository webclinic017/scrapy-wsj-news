Peter DeFazio, the chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he won’t seek reelection, becoming the latest Democrat to retire ahead of what is expected to be a difficult midterm election as the party tries to hold on to its House majority.<br />“It’s time for me to pass the baton to the next generation so I can focus on my health and well-being,” Mr. DeFazio said in a statement on Wednesday. The Oregon lawmaker, 74 years old, has been in the House for 36 years and represented part of Oregon’s west coast, including the college town of Eugene."
