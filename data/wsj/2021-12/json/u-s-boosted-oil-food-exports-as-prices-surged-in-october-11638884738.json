    "body": "The U.S. trade deficit narrowed sharply in October as an increase in exports of U.S. energy and agricultural commodities outpaced growth in imports, which were restrained by a growing backlog at U.S. ports that month.<br />The deficit in trade of goods and services fell by 17.6% to a seasonally adjusted $67.1 billion in October, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, compared with a record $81.4 billion gap in September."
