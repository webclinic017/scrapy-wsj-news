    "body": "The decline of coal in the U.S. is playing out in rural Utah, where a mine is losing two top domestic customers because their power plants are switching to cleaner fuels. One reason: California is taxing and banning carbon-intensive energy sources to slow climate change.<br />The loss of business will potentially cost revenue and jobs for three counties where Wolverine Fuels LLC operates its mines. The economic benefits from the switch to cleaner fuels will be felt far away, across the state in Utah and hundreds of miles away in Nevada and California."
