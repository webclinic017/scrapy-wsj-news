    "body": "UBS has lost its appeal against a French tax evasion charge, but won the chance to affordably dispel one of the few clouds still hanging over its stock.<br />A court of appeals rejected UBS’s appeal against a 2019 decision that it was guilty of helping wealthy clients in France evade taxes. The bank can claim a partial victory, though, as its penalties were reduced to 1.8 billion euros, equivalent to $2 billion, from €4.7 billion. The bank has to decide if it will appeal the decision to the country’s supreme court."
