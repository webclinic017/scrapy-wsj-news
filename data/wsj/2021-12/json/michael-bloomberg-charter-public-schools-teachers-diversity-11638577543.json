    "body": "Michael Bloomberg is to be commended for his interest in enhancing charter schools (“Why I’m Backing Charter Schools,” op-ed, Dec. 2). I do, however, take issue with his laying the onus of poor public-school performance on the teachers and their unions. They are scapegoats.<br />Charter schools can and do expel disruptive students, thus creating a proper learning environment. Regular public schools can do so only with extremely violent students or sexual predators. Many public schools must put up with disruptive students, yielding an environment in which learning is impossible. Teachers are often powerless to do anything about it. This is akin to the tendency in cities to redefine or ignore most misdemeanors and many felonies. Blame the rules laid down by ultraleft politicians."
