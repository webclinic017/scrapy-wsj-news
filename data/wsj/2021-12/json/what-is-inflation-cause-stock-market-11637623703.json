    "body": "U.S. inflation has risen to its highest rate in three decades this fall and is estimated to have accelerated more last month, with economists forecasting that consumer prices rose by 6.7% in November from a year ago. Consumers are seeing prices rise sharply for a variety of goods and services because of persistent supply and labor shortages and strong demand. The Labor Department’s November consumer-price index will be released Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET.<br />Stoked by imbalances in the economy created by the Covid-19 pandemic, inflation is one of the most vexing problems facing economists and government policy makers—from Federal Reserve officials, who set interest rates, to the Biden administration and Congress. The causes are myriad, and the tools that are usually deployed can, in some scenarios, push the economy into a recession as a way of taming price pressures."
