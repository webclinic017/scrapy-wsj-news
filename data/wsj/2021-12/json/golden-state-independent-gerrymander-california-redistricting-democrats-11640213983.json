    "body": "You’ve probably read that the GOP is at a redistricting advantage going into the 2022 congressional elections because Republicans control more state legislatures, and some Democratic states have delegated redistricting to nonpartisan commissions. We’ll see about that. Deep-blue California sends 52 Representatives to Washington, the most of any state, and its commission is pulling off an epic partisan and racial gerrymander.<br />California’s Citizen’s Redistricting Commission, established in 2008, says on its website that lines “shall not be drawn to favor” either party. Yet the map released this week miraculously locks in 44 safe Democratic seats compared to only five safe Republican seats, according to the Princeton Gerrymandering Project. Three competitive seats lean Republican."
