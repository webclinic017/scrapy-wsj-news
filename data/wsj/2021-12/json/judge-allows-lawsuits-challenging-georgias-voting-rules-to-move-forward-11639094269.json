    "body": "A federal judge on Thursday rejected requests by Georgia to throw out lawsuits challenging Republican-backed changes to the state’s voting rules, clearing the cases to move forward.<br />U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee in Atlanta said the lawsuits make plausible claims that Georgia’s new procedures violate federal law, including by discriminating against minority voters. The judge, a Trump appointee, wasn’t considering the merits of the allegations, only whether they were sufficient for the cases to move to trial."
