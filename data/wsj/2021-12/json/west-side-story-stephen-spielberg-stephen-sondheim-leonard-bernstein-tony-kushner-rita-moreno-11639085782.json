    "body": "The first thing that seizes your attention in Steven Spielberg’s “West Side Story,” showing nationally in theaters, is the trio of annunciatory notes from the greatest score ever written for a Broadway musical. They’re followed by the ominous finger snaps that foreshadow a story of love caught in the crossfire of racial hatred in a multiracial New York neighborhood in the 1950s. (The words are by Stephen Sondheim, who died late last month; the music was composed by Leonard Bernstein.) For those who know the original show, or the 1961 movie, the reconnection is instant. For those who don’t—a great many young people, it’s worth noting—the effect may be electrifying, a bombshell of musical energy bursting out of a time capsule.<br />Either way, Mr. Spielberg’s film is a revelation. He has seized the moment by rethinking and reworking the source material. The results aren’t perfect. The production suffers from a heart condition of sorts, a flaw in the love story that’s flagrant but not life-threatening. Altogether, though, this pulsing, exultant musical connects a classic of American entertainment to a contemporary audience as never before."
