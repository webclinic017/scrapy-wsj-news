    "body": "In “Eric Adams Will Need Help to Make New York Safe Again” (Cross Country, Dec. 18), Seth Barron asserts, “However one feels about the use—or supposed overuse—of ‘stop, question and frisk’ . . . there is no dispute that the policing tactic was instrumental in driving down the rate of violent crime in New York City.” But plenty of serious analysts dispute that; the evidence does not support the claim.<br />Violent crime trended down in New York City for 28 years beginning with the last two of David Dinkins’s term as mayor, through the Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg years, and for the first six years of Bill de Blasio’s mayoralty. During this time, police practices varied substantially. Ascribing causality to any one tactic is sophistry."
