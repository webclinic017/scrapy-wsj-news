    "body": "The wisdom of crowds doesn’t always prevail. But more than $10 trillion has been wagered that it will in the coming year.<br />The combined market values of  Apple Inc.,   Microsoft ,  Google-parent Alphabet Inc.,  Amazon . com and Meta Platforms—the company once known as  Facebook —stand at $10.1 trillion as of Wednesday’s close. That’s up from $7.5 trillion at the start of the year, reflecting a 35% rise that exceeds the gains of the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite in what has been another strong year for stocks."
