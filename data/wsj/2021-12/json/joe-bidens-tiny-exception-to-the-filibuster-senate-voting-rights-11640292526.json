    "body": "President Biden now says he wants to bust the Senate’s filibuster to pass a Democratic overhaul of American elections. “If the only thing standing between getting voting rights legislation passed and not getting passed is the filibuster,” he told ABC News this week, “I support making the exception of voting rights for the filibuster.”<br />An “exception” to the filibuster? This is like an engineer saying he merely wants to remove a section of the Hoover Dam. Watch out for le déluge. Yet Chuck Schumer told colleagues in a letter Monday that he plans to bring up voting legislation in January and will “consider changes to any rules” that stand in the way."
