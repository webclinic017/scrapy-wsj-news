    "body": "I was completing a doctorate in the history of science and technology at Johns Hopkins University in March 2020, when the pandemic upended my professional life as it has countless others. The university administration sent an email announcing the closing of campus and encouraging researchers “to focus on the activities that can be completed remotely, such as writing papers and grant proposals, and completing data analysis.”<br />It will take years to understand the full implications of asking scientists around the world to isolate themselves and do science from home. But one of the most famous and misunderstood trials of history—the Galileo affair—offers some hints of what the global lockdowns may mean for the scientific community. Although commonly interpreted as a battle between science and religion, Galileo’s condemnation by the Catholic Church was more complex. It also involved a book retracted because of a pandemic."
