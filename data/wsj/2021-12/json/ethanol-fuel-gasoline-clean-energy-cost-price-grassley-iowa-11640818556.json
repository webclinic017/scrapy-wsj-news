    "body": "Sen. Chuck Grassley’s argument that ethanol fuel produced from corn is “clean” is a bit too clever (Letters, Dec. 23). The acreage devoted to producing corn for ethanol is about the size of the state of Ohio. Diesel fuel must be used by an army of farm equipment to plow, plant, fertilize, spray and harvest. Fertilizer comes from fossil-fuel sources and needs fossil fuels to be delivered to farmers.<br />The intensive use of Roundup also affects water, soil and air. Now that Roundup is ineffective against certain “superweeds,” the herbicide Dicamba has been added to the mix. Now that Dicamba has produced water hemp weeds rapidly evolving to resist it, what new chemicals will be required?"
