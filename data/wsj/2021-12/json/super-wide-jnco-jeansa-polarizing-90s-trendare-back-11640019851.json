    "body": "In the 1990s, JNCO jeans were big—in every sense of the term. With hulking legs (imagine fitting a 2-liter bottle of Coke horizontally across the hem), JNCOs were the street-sweeping denims that raver kids, graffiti artists, skateboarders and those pretending to be part of those subcultures wore. They represented a generational divide, tut-tutted by straight-leg Lee-wearing dads and even banned by some school districts who considered them unsightly. The controversy only bolstered JNCO, whose parent company Revatex reached $186.9 million in sales in 1998. But the success withered fast. In the early 2000s, JNCO’s wide jeans were supplanted by skinny jeans which clenched calves across America.<br />Now progressive young shoppers are reviving JNCO’s jumbo-sized jeans. Depop, a youth-leaning resale website, reported that between spring 2021 and today, it has seen a 30% increase in searches for JNCOs and a 35% increase for “wide leg” jeans more broadly. “As we emerged from the pandemic earlier in the year, we also saw more users going for a relaxed, baggy look,” said Lizzy de Bruin, a strategic inventory lead at Depop. At on-the-pulse vintage stores like Procell in New York City, vintage JNCOs are being resold for around $250. And the brand itself is in the midst of a slow-rolling relaunch."
