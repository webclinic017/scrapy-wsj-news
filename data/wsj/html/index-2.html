An acquaintance has asked Mr. Levin to assist in locating a friend’s son, who has gone missing. The man, in his mid-20s, entered Syria as a volunteer with a medical organization, and hasn’t been heard from in two months. The news of his disappearance has not been made public and the true nature of his activities in Syria isn’t entirely clear.<br />Mr. Levin agrees to help, and over the course of 20 days travels through the Middle East in search of the missing man. In Amman, he meets a duo who might be connected to the possible kidnapper but want a million dollars to provide an introduction. In Beirut, he has an unlikely encounter with a sheikh (whom he does not name, but whose identity may be obvious to casual observers of Middle Eastern politics). And in Dubai, the author tracks down the ex-wife of the suspected kidnapper; her desire for revenge against her former husband motivates her to help Mr. Levin. It is a race against time, as the author scrambles to ascertain whether the young man is still alive and, if so, how he might be gotten out.</td>

None of which is true from what we see, which is often chaotic but more frequently bliss.<br />Director Michael Lindsay-Hogg, whose protean rock videos included “The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus,” which had featured John Lennon, was enlisted by the Beatles to memorialize their self-imposed makeover: They had ceased touring or any live performance in 1966, and the subsequent records, especially 1968’s so-called “White Album,” were marked by a drifting apart. Technology, including advances in multitrack recording, meant they didn’t even have to play together. The idea behind “Let It Be” was a return to a more basic music, stuff they could play together, live, which would lead to an album, a TV special directed by Mr. Lindsay-Hogg and a live performance—perhaps in the picturesque Sabratha Amphitheater in Libya (a real idea that keeps getting brought up, and shot down).</td>

As recently as Nov. 5 he was charged with disorderly conduct and recklessly endangering safety after punching the mother of his child, then running her over with a vehicle, according to a complaint.</td>

      <td>AS MOUNT EVEREST climbers near the summit, the air thins and the lack of oxygen can cause even the most hale explorers to pass out. You may feel a similar sensation when you clock the prices of this winter’s designer down coats. Givenchy is peddling a $4,290 cream puffer that is as inflated as a pool floatie; fellow French luxury house Balmain sells an inky one at $2,950; and Moncler in collaboration with Japanese designer Hiroshi Fujiwara offers a tartan style for $2,795, as part of its Genius sub-label.<br />Breathtaking price tags notwithstanding, it seems that some folks are buying these investment puffers. On my recent visit to Galeries Lafayette, the chichi shopping institution in the heart of Paris, racks carrying clothes by luxury stalwarts like Loewe, Celine and  Brunello Cucinelli  stood largely ignored, while shoppers bustled about the Moncler coat section with its four-figure puffers. At Bloomingdale’s, pricey puffers such as Stone Island’s $1,073 crinkly electric-blue nylon jacket have been “performing really well,” according to Justin Berkowitz, the store’s men’s fashion director. Egalitarian trail-mix types—or anyone lacking a second home in Aspen—might find such elitist outerwear laughable. Uniqlo’s $80 puffers remain a perennial winter favorite, and many brands from Gap to Muji to  Urban Outfitters  offer a serviceable sub-$125 down coat. So why would anyone shell out $2,550 for a Fendi puffer? Won’t Patagonia’s $229 version keep you warm enough?</td>

Instead, he is buying their monetary policy and inflation.<br />Mr. Powell has run the Fed for four years, and Ms. Brainard has been a Governor for more than seven. As far as we can tell they have never disagreed on monetary decisions, though Ms. Brainard (an Obama appointee) has dissented in favor of tougher bank regulation. Neither deserves reappointment on their record of the last four years, as inflation has risen three times above the Fed’s 2% mandate to the highest rate in 30 years.</td>

If you are over 18, haven’t had Covid-19, and received your first shot more than six months ago, you should get a booster. It will protect you and others from the disease, and the side effects are minimal.<br />A new study in Nature demonstrates that the viral load decreases after the booster, which should mean a lower risk of transmission in a breakthrough case. A randomized study of more than 10,000 patients over 16, recently presented by  Pfizer  to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, showed 95% protection against infection among those in the boosted group who didn’t have evidence of previous infection. The side effects of boosters were similar to those from previous vaccine studies, mainly irritation at the injection site, fever and fatigue, but no evidence of myocarditis.</td>

In the Middle East, as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin tried to reassure key allies about America’s continuing commitment to their security, U.S. naval forces participated with Israel, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates in the unprecedented joint Arab-Israeli military exercises in the Red Sea.<br />This shift from an Asia First policy to Global Engagement isn’t something the Biden administration is voluntarily choosing.
