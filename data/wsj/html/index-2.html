It’s clearer than ever that the Democrats and Republicans who want to vote for the $1 trillion Senate infrastructure bill are being taken for a ride.<br />House progressives blocked a vote on the infrastructure bill for a second time last week, and again they did it with President Biden’s blessing. Multiple news reports say the White House gave Rep. Pramila Jayapal, head of the Progressive Caucus, the go-ahead to overrule Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s desire to vote on infrastructure before Mr. Biden left for Europe. Mrs. Pelosi had to pull the bill for a second humiliating time.</td>

President Biden and his European Union counterparts made important progress in putting to bed one of the more foolhardy legacies of the Trump era, a trade war over tariffs on European steel and aluminum.<br />President Trump in 2018 slapped tariffs of 25% on steel imported from anywhere other than Canada or Mexico, and 10% on aluminum, under a trade-law provision known as Section 232. That law authorizes tariffs for the sake of national security, but Mr. Trump’s gambit hurt his domestic economic-growth agenda and goaded the EU into imposing retaliatory tariffs on a range of U.S. goods from  Harley-Davidson  motorcycles to Kentucky bourbon.</td>

For all of history, humans have sought to understand reality and our role in it. Since the Enlightenment, we have considered our reason—our ability to investigate, understand and elaborate—our primary means of explaining the world, and by explaining it, contributing to it. For the past 300 years, in what historians have come to call the Age of Reason, we have conducted ourselves accordingly; exploring, experimenting, inventing and building.</td>

Like everyone else, we simply dealt with it. Price increases were expected and accepted throughout the economy.<br />Eventually President Reagan and Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker broke the inflationary cycle. Prices stabilized, and for the remainder of my 30 years in manufacturing, getting customers to agree to a price increase was like pulling teeth. Every hike had to be fully justified and robustly negotiated. Now I’m hearing from businesses across Wisconsin and the U.S. that inflationary expectations have returned, and price and wage increases are becoming routine.</td>

In a steadily escalating campaign, she has checkmated every move I’ve made. She’s climbed a high deck, vaulted into pots on pedestals and hurled herself into baskets hung five feet above ground. Two live traps ignored. My dog, who is no slouch, has done his best. The squirrel watches and waits until my dog is indoors and I have driven off. Each time I come home, there’s another sad pile of bits where once there were blossoms. Still, Mary Roach’s “Fuzz: When Nature Breaks the Law” makes me feel grateful that my nemesis is only a rodent, and that I live in Ohio, not Colorado or India. My refrigerator will not be emptied by a bear; I will not be throttled by a leopard while taking out the compost.<br />Ms. Roach’s books have tackled human pursuits such as sex, digestion, death, war, space travel and even the afterlife, all with a “prove it to me!” attitude that is at turns exhilarating and astonishing. She wonders about the particulars many would prefer to leave a mystery, with a curiosity that is anything but childlike. With “Fuzz,” she focuses on those instances when nature, for a shocking change, wins.</td>

      <td>The singer-songwriter’s latest album sounds a lot like his past work and tells listeners exactly how they should feel.</td>
      <td>The staggering success of English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran is so difficult to comprehend one can only recite statistics: He has the most popular song of all time on Spotify—“Shape of You” is closing in on three billion streams—and he had the highest-grossing tour in music history, pulling in $775 million from nearly nine million paying customers in the string of concerts that came to a close in 2018. That massive single and tour were connected to “Divide,” the top-selling album of 2017, which won Best Pop Vocal Album at the Grammys. The tendency to think of Mr. Sheeran’s music, which is powered by his acoustic guitar strumming and his flexible tenor, in terms of figures on a balance sheet is helped along by the fact that his solo records are titled with mathematical symbols. “Divide” has the two dots and horizontal line we use for division, and his previous LPs, 2011’s “Plus” and 2014’s “Multiply,” both feature the associated operators. The flurry of record-setting data surrounding his work makes you want to reach for a calculator in order to get a handle on it.<br />On “Tides,” the opening track from Mr. Sheeran’s just-released fourth studio album, “Equals” (Asylum/Atlantic), the singer shares the feelings of uncertainty that came with his triumphs, and math is part of the equation: “I lost the confidence in who I was / Too busy trying to chase the high and get the numbers up.” It’s a stomping up-tempo number designed for clapping and shouting along—“I wanted something you could open with in a stadium,” he told Apple Music in a recent interview; he’s the rare musician in a position to think about such considerations—and it finds him reflecting on his previous album’s impact. Mr. Sheeran is somehow only 30, but for him that means he’s getting older, and he’s now married with a child. “Equals” is his attempt to square his desire for a tranquil family life and its associated pleasures with the reality of being a global celebrity.</td>

Dell began evaluating the spinoff last year—about four years after its acquisition of EMC also gave it ownership of the company that pioneered the use of so-called virtualization software used by businesses to squeeze more performance out of their networks. VMware went public in 2007 but was still majority-owned at the time by EMC.</td>

This revisionist view is not what the Founders understood. In 1639 the Mather School in Massachusetts became the first publicly funded elementary school. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams encouraged taxpayer-funded schools. Adams drafted the Massachusetts constitution supporting “public schools.” Neither Jefferson nor Adams thought they were violating the free-speech rights of parents.<br />Whatever fears of foreigners occurred later had nothing to do with the Founders. Neither Catholics nor Jews formed a significant U.S. demographic then. It strains credulity to think a desire to forge an educated citizenry had as subtext the shackling of minds with Protestant indoctrination.</td>

Baker, a distinguished former FBI special agent, mangled the history of the Watergate era with this assertion about the director of the FBI in the first Nixon term: “[J. Edgar] Hoover pushed back against the demands of President Nixon and Attorney General John Mitchell for ‘black-bag operations’ against political enemies.”<br />Mr. Baker was wrong to attribute such demands to John Mitchell. The scholarly literature on the Nixon presidency has long recorded, and my own research confirmed, that it was to Attorney General Mitchell that Director Hoover appealed for assistance when President Nixon ordered the bureau, in July 1970, to implement the illegal measures outlined in the so-called Huston Plan. This included a broad-ranging program of counter-measures, including black-bag jobs, aimed at domestic terror groups, antiwar radicals and others who posed a threat to national security at the time. Testimony at the 1973 Senate Watergate hearings established that it was after Mitchell’s intervention that Nixon swiftly rescinded his approval of the Huston Plan.</td>

CO2 is still the biggest long-term climate problem, because it lingers in the atmosphere for centuries, while methane degrades in about a decade. But that also means if we stop replenishing the methane, we reap a substantial and continuing benefit. Less methane means less “radiative forcing,” which drives bigger rainfall events, droughts and stronger hurricanes.</td>

The U.S. trucking industry is short some 80,000 drivers in a country where more than 70% of commercial goods reach their destination via truck. One reason is that the U.S. Department of Transportation makes it extremely difficult for would-be truckers to obtain commercial driver’s licenses if they’re being treated for opioid-use disorder with buprenorphine or methadone. States have even revoked licenses of patients who had been driving safely for years, solely because they took their medication as prescribed.<br />The problem arises in part from contradictory regulations. Two federal rules allow commercial drivers to take controlled substances if prescribed by a medical practitioner who has concluded they won’t impair the ability to drive safely. But two other regulations state that commercial-driving employers aware of controlled substance use by employees shouldn’t permit them to drive, with no clear distinction between medical and nonmedical use.</td>

      <td>Teens are shifting from Instagram to TikTok even as critics claim the company has few competitors.</td>
      <td>The leak of Facebook’s internal documents is Exhibit A for those who would indict the social-media giant as the modern equivalent of a greedy railroad monopoly. But as the Biden administration’s antitrust zealots celebrate finding evidence of predatory algorithms, they overlook an inconvenient revelation from the documents: Facebook is a social-media geriatric losing ground to its competitors.<br />According to the documents, Facebook is alarmed by how fast its pipeline of new users is drying up. The use of the Facebook app by young adults is expected to drop 4% in the next two years, and a 45% decline among teens. What about Facebook-owned Instagram? Doesn’t that app bring in the young users, while older people use Facebook? It turns out Instagram is showing its age as well, as teens migrate in large numbers to TikTok and Snapchat.</td>

The amount I am converting on a yearly basis is based somewhat on my target incremental federal tax bracket. These conversions also affect Medicare Part B costs. Whereas higher federal taxes are incremental in nature, the Medicare income-related monthly adjustment amount (IRMAA) surcharges aren’t, and one moves to a significantly higher monthly expense if exceeding an IRMAA threshold by only $1 of incremental earnings. Being aware of this unique risk allows me to plan on how much to convert on a yearly basis with a target IRMAA, rather than the incremental federal tax rate.<br />Douglas Propp</td>
