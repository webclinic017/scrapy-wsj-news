Not only that. Sweet, swift, swank, swell, fast as hell, hushed as a chapel, cool as marble, minty fresh. With its front and rear e-motors providing a digitally mastered 536 hp to the wheels, the i4 M50 accelerates like Derby Lane’s electric rabbit—0-60 mph in 3.7 seconds. But even at Autobahn speeds, just ask; the upwelling torque (max 586 lb-ft) will mush you lovingly into the seat.</td>

But in France, a gratin is as likely to be a light fruit dessert as it is something savory.

Most any fruit can be used, from citrus to mango in winter and, in the summer, berries, stone fruit and figs.<br />This remarkably quick and easy dessert comes together in just a few swift, elegant strokes. The blast of high heat from the broiler intensifies and concentrates the flavor of fruit, fast; a small amount of sabayon gives it a luxurious, silken quality. In summer it’s a splendid alternative to fruit salad, and in winter it offers comfort and warmth and a bit of consoling indulgence.</td>

We unloaded the bales from delivery trucks, loaded them onto flatbed trailers, hauled them into the fields, and stacked them into neat rows. We covered the rows and secured them with ropes. Then storms ripped the shrouds, rain soaked the bails, and $450,000 of hay rotted into the ground.<br />Hoarding is a natural human response during times of uncertainty, and people in business can panic-buy like shoppers jockeying for toilet paper at  Costco .  Hoarding rarely turns out well, however. With supply-chain disruptions and shortages from pandemic lockdowns, many managers are again questioning whether stocking up is really that bad.

      <td>A friend of Wordsworth and Coleridge, Charles Lamb cherished literary ambitions. Then calamity struck.</td>
      <td>For much of his literary life, Charles Lamb was a jack of all trades and a master of none. He wrote poetry like his Romantic contemporaries and good friends Samuel Taylor Coleridge and William Wordsworth though his verse was of a lesser caliber. He produced a sentimental novel that underwhelmed and a farcical play that bombed. He collaborated with his sister, Mary, on a children’s adaptation of Shakespeare’s work, and compiled critical commentaries on the bard’s fellow Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists. Only when Lamb turned his hand to the familiar essay at the age of 45 did he find his true métier. Adopting the nom de plume of “Elia” but drawing upon his own thoughts and deeds, Lamb captivated readers with a winning blend of insight, intimacy, wordplay, allusion and what Walter Pater called “hints of the innermost reason in things.”<br />However, Lamb wrote while battling personal demons. He was self-conscious about his stutter and drank heavily to overcome it and to endure frequent “sad depression of spirits.” That depression took shape, and took hold, following a life-defining family catastrophe. Lamb, then aged 22, gave a stark summary of it in a letter to Coleridge: “My poor dear dearest sister in a fit of insanity has been the death of her own mother. I was at hand only time enough to snatch the knife out of her grasp.”</td>

      <td>People shouldn’t have to leave their communities in search of prosperity. Why not bring the digital economy to them?</td>
      <td>Americans should not have to leave their hometowns in order to seek opportunity or build wealth. But our modern, digital economy has concentrated its dynamism in a handful of mostly coastal cities, including San Francisco, Seattle, New York, Boston and Austin. When these cities prosper, cities such as Youngstown, Ohio, or Beckley, West Virginia, don’t share in the benefit. Many residents of middle-American cities and rural areas are tired of seeing their young people buy one-way tickets out of their home states in search of work. They worry about the loss of community, the shuttering of stores and the dwindling of church congregations.<br />Most of these Americans understand the importance of the tech sector to the U.S. economy. Technology creates trillion-dollar valuations, billionaire entrepreneurs and six-figure salaries for those still in their twenties. By 2025, the U.S. will have 25 million digital jobs—more than the number of manufacturing and construction jobs combined. These jobs have a median salary of $80,000, nearly double the national average. They should not be available only to high-schoolers in Cupertino, Calif.—home to Apple—who have sophisticated robotics workshops in their garages.</td>

Where Ye goes, chatter follows (as his recent paparazzi-tracked relationship with the actress Julia Fox proves) and this collaboration has been no different.

But as the pandemic’s progression has made clear, public-health officials should aim to do more than merely minimize the spread of disease. They should seek to reduce the total harm caused by both infection and heavy-handed attempts to prevent it.<br />Reducing the incidence of disease isn’t necessarily desirable if excessive prevention, in the form of lockdowns or school closures, is more costly to society than the damage done by an illness. We don’t close highways to minimize accidental deaths, despite the existence of dangerous drivers. Yet this is exactly what we’re doing when the government intervenes to limit the spread of communicable diseases by, for instance, mandating vaccines that don’t prevent transmission.</td>
