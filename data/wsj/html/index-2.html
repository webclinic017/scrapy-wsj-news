James Clyburn. The gambit worked. Mr. Clyburn endorsed, Mr. Biden won in the Palmetto State, and he went on to defeat Donald Trump.</td>

Hours after a snowy bridge in the city collapsed, injuring 10 people, the President promised to fix all of the nation’s 43,000 faltering bridges. “We’re sending the money,” he assured.<br />Sorry, he isn’t. The bill he signed doesn’t have nearly enough money unless his Administration plans to borrow from the Energy Department’s green energy venture-capital fund. The bill includes $40 billion in new funding for bridges, a pittance compared to the $156 billion for mass transit and rail that are bleeding cash due to generous labor agreements and low ridership. Mass transit had already received $70 billion in pandemic relief.</td>

But eight years after Vermont’s effort to enact a state single-payer healthcare system went over a cliff, California is galloping toward the same precipice. Lawmakers in Sacramento should have learned from Montpelier’s experience. Instead, they seem eager to repeat it.<br />Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin campaigned on a promise to enact single  payer but shelved his plans in 2014. The idea was “just not affordable,” he said after getting a look at the cost to Vermont’s economy. “We were pretty shocked at the tax rates we were going to have to charge.” The single-payer bill pending in the California Legislature goes far beyond the proposals Vermont considered.</td>

      <td>The temporary expansion led to overpayments, and many families will soon face surprise tax bills.</td>
      <td>Millions of American families learned from the Internal Revenue Service this month that they may owe additional taxes for 2021. The reason was they’d received advance payments of the child tax credit last year that may have been too high. These families will now have to submit an additional form with their 2021 income-tax returns and pay whatever they owe (or claim whatever they still have coming). It’s a good lesson in the limitations of the IRS—it isn’t well-positioned to make welfare payments.<br />Although many families were caught by surprise, the potential for discrepancies in the payouts was never a secret. Lawmakers acknowledged it when they increased the credit’s value and authorized advance payments as part of last year’s American Rescue Plan. Knowing that not all the payments would line up fully with their criteria, Congress created a “safe harbor” so that two-parent families with less than $60,000 in income (and lower amounts for other types of households) wouldn’t be held liable for any miscalculations. For the many households not protected by this measure, the time for a reckoning has come. Both they and the IRS will have their hands full.</td>

But fans will have their hands full overcoming a rare challenge.<br />Two years ago this column lamented that security rules for the Super Bowl prevented Kansas City Chiefs fans from reaching their potential in a game they play better than anyone else: pregame food and frivolity. The NFL’s draconian prohibition on open flames in Super Bowl parking lots severely limited the pregame possibilities. Fortunately at this weekend’s conference championship in their home stadium, Chiefs fans will enjoy the freedom to cook. The challenge is deciding what to cook in a time of surging inflation.</td>

It is being squeezed by China from the outside, and there are anxieties over Washington’s long-term reliability as the center. That leaves two options for U.S. allies: connect other spokes to reinforce the structure, or ditch Washington and find a different hub of support.</td>

Donald Trump’s record complicates such claims.<br />One of the most underreported stories of the Trump presidency is the extent to which black economic fortunes improved. The mainstream media presented Mr. Trump daily as a bigot whose policies would harm the interests of racial and ethnic minorities. Meantime, black economic advancement occurred to an extent unseen not only under Barack Obama but going back several generations—until the pandemic shutdowns brought progress to a halt.</td>

      <td>Political conflicts, legal battles and overlapping claims set one level of government against another.</td>
      <td>Recently the Supreme Court halted the federal vaccine-or-test mandate by a 6-3 vote. This split can be explained along the usual ideological lines. The six conservatives blocked the requirement, while the three progressives approved it. But the votes can be more naturally split based on a single, evergreen question: Who decides? Indeed, that question was posed in both Justice Neil Gorsuch’s concurrence and the joint dissent by the court’s progressives. The dissenters would have allowed the executive branch to impose the mandate. The majority held that Congress, and not bureaucrats, must expressly authorize it. Justice Gorsuch’s concurrence suggested that such an intrusive power is reserved to the states and not to the federal government.<br />The question that hovered over the court’s decision is at the center of “Who Decides? States as Laboratories of Constitutional Experimentation.” Jeffrey Sutton, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, carefully delineates the conflicts, contests and overlapping claims between the federal government, state governments and the people. He is well-positioned to do so. For the past two decades, while serving as a federal appellate judge, Judge Sutton has become—in his spare time, as it were—an evangelist for the underappreciated importance of state constitutional law.</td>

      <td>In Tessa Hadley’s novel, an English family is tugged at by social changes without—and stirrings within.</td>
      <td>Tessa Hadley, author now of eight novels and three collections of short stories, has few rivals in portraying the dynamics of families and the intricate weave of emotional affiliations among members. She is a genius at capturing fugitive thoughts and memories, the propulsive energy of desire, and the provisional reasoning that constitute inner being. Her plots, though often marked by a stunning revelation, are not where the dramatic action is; that occurs within the characters themselves. Her 2015 novel “The Past” is her masterpiece in this regard, not least in her depiction of the inner worlds of children, but her present novel, “Free Love,” approaches that work’s agility in capturing thought and feeling in flight. In this case, we have an English family in a moment of social upheaval remaking their lives, unyoking themselves from each other and from the conventions of the past.<br />The novel begins in 1967 with Phyllis Fischer dressing carefully for a little dinner she and her husband, Roger, are giving that evening. He is a high-placed civil servant in the Foreign Office; she is a housewife and stalwart of gracious living. They live in a charming Arts-and-Crafts house in a wealthy London suburb and are the parents of Colette, 15, and Hugh, 9. One guest will be coming: Nicholas “Nicky” Knight, a young man in his early 20s, the son of old friends of Roger’s parents. This is the first time the Fischers have seen him since he was a child—and we would not be surprised if it were the last. Arriving over an hour late, he is a sloppy, rude, insufferable prig. But Phyllis, at 40, is viscerally drawn to him, attracted by his disorderliness, by “his long hair, scruffy flared trousers, unbuttoned unironed shirt, drawling mockery, thin smiles, offensive opinions, deliciously offensive everything.”</td>

It begins with a repetitive pattern in the piano that suggests a weariness of spirit, setting the tone for the coming lyrics. As the piano notes move steadily into the lower register, that weariness grows. Sharp dissonances stab through the musical texture, emphasizing the phrase “A long ways from home.” It’s a demonstration of consummate skill and sensitivity that seems to fulfill the prophecy of Burleigh’s teacher, Antonín Dvořák.<br />Interviewed in 1893, one year into his three-year stay in the U.S., Dvořák contended that “the future music of this country must be founded upon what are called the negro melodies. This must be the real foundation of any serious and original school of composition to be developed in the United States.” In “Dvořák’s Prophecy and the Vexed Fate of Black Classical Music,” Mr. Horowitz—a distinguished cultural historian of American classical music and the author of 10 books on the subject—examines Dvořák’s prophecy and what became of it.</td>

      <td>FOR ANYONE eager to thaw out this winter on a sun-drenched beach in the Caribbean, a word of caution: Brace yourself for sticker shock. Room rates at the luxury hotels have risen considerably since before the pandemic, nearly 25% in some cases, said Melissa Pugh, a Jet World Travel consultant who specializes in high-end Caribbean vacations. “Covid was very expensive for a lot of hotels and still is,” she explained, attributing the price hike, in part, to staffing shortages and enhanced cleaning and safety protocols. Yet, even the soaring costs aren’t enough to quell demand, and the region’s most popular luxury resorts are rapidly booking up.<br />Luckily, thrifty sunseekers can still find reasonably affordable, attractive accommodations scattered throughout the Caribbean. Below, we’ve zeroed in on six favorites, from a 155-room resort in Belize to a four-bedroom villa in Tobago. They may not be as well-known as their competitors but they’re well located—on or near the sea—and uncrowded. As for the current Covid regulations, each country has its own set of requirements. Be sure to inquire with the hotel before booking about the most recent vaccination and testing policies in place and check the latest health information on the CDC website.</td>

      <td>A pair of train passengers form an unlikely bond during a long-haul trip to the Russian port city of Murmansk</td>
      <td>Juho Kuosmanen’s “Compartment No. 6,” in Russian and Finnish with English subtitles, starts as a road movie—a railroad movie—and threatens to become a darkly funny horror story. (It’s playing in theaters in New York and Los Angeles this week before entering wider distribution.) A young Finnish student in Moscow, Laura (Seidi Haarla), boards a train in the dead of winter that’s bound for the arctic port of Murmansk, then finds herself stuck with a thuggish Russian sleeping-car companion. Ljoha (Yuriy Borisov) has already turned their tiny compartment into a garbage dump, and the train hasn’t yet left the station. Laura, enchanted by archaeology, is hoping to see rock carvings that are 10,000 years old. Ljoha, a smoker, boozer and latter-day caveman, is headed for work in a mine near the Arctic Circle. A claustrophobic trip for moviegoers, then? No, not at all. It’s an improbably beautiful film about strangers on a train coming to terms with each other as they make peace with their troubled selves.<br />On the surface it doesn’t compute that the two would have anything in common. She’s gay, or at least she has recently been involved with a woman we see briefly during a preface in a cozy Moscow apartment. (The time is the late 1990s.) He broods and glowers when he isn’t coming on to her with hilarious insolence and invincible ignorance. He couldn’t care less about rock carvings. When she tells him how old they are his response is “So what?,” to which she can only say something anodyne about understanding the present by knowing the past. But one’s understanding of the present can also be increased by seizing it fully, and both of them begin to do that out of an unspoken yearning that neither starts nor ends with sex.</td>
