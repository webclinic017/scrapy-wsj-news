      <td>The killing of a wealthy former slaver in 19th-century Salem brought famous names and lurid details to the ensuing murder trial.</td>
      <td>The trials most often associated with Salem, Mass., took place in colonial America and resulted in the hangings of 19 women and men convicted of witchcraft. Almost 150 years later, Salem was again gripped by prosecutions and executions, but while the 17th-century witch trials remain infamous today, the events of 1830, which consumed the region at the time, have been largely forgotten.<br />In a slim, engaging volume, Edward J. Renehan Jr. chronicles the dark proceedings and argues that the explanation for their current obscurity is itself an interesting story. “Deliberate Evil: Nathaniel Hawthorne, Daniel Webster, and the 1830 Murder of a Salem Slave Trader” describes the brutal killing of 82-year-old Joseph White, its influence on writers including Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe, and the subsequent efforts of the families involved to erase the episode from historical memory.</td>

The Massachusetts Senator added: “These record-setting natural gas exports are leading to higher prices for consumers, and they show no signs of a slowdown.”</td>

      <td>The television landscape is broader—and more inviting—than ever before thanks to shows like ‘Ted Lasso,’ Stanley Tucci’s ‘Searching for Italy’ and Peter Jackson’s epic documentary on the Beatles.</td>
      <td>Some of the more memorable new shows of 2021 weren’t really new—the footage Peter Jackson used in “The Beatles: Get Back,” for instance, was more than 50 years old. But the second season of “Never Have I Ever” and the third season of “Sex Education” were also among the best things on television this past year. They provided evidence that series could actually improve with age. They raised viewer hopes for 2022. Maybe Stanley Tucci will even go back to Italy?<br />At the risk of repeating 2020’s end-of-year refrain, there is too much on television right now for anyone to watch it all, or even keep track of. Years ago, a friend said, “You can have a very healthy movie life and never see anything that’s nominated for an Oscar,” which was absolutely true then—and something similar is true now about TV: We each live our own TV lives, lives that occasionally intersect but more often occupy their own quirky niches. I, for one, decided early on that life was too short for “Succession,” with its irredeemable characters who never went anywhere or did anything. Many others disagree. They think it’s a wonderful show. They’re also entitled to their opinions. And their personalized menus.</td>

The World Inequality Lab’s “World Inequality Report”—you know where this is going—finds that the pandemic year saw the steepest increase on record in global billionaires’ share of global wealth. The top 0.01%, a club with some 520,000 members worldwide, saw their share of global wealth increase to 11% from about 10%. The world’s remaining billionaires saw their share grow to 3.5% of all wealth from about 2% before the pandemic.</td>

      <td>The U.S. experienced its largest-ever single year homicide spike in 2020, and crime now polls as one of the top voter concerns. This has many criminal-justice-reform advocates and their media allies scrambling to convince Americans that things aren’t really so bad, no matter what the data say.<br />At CNN, data journalist Priya Krishnakumar explains “how crime stats lie” by pointing out that 2020’s murder rate was “40% below what it was in the 1980s and 1990s.” The Brennan Center for Justice acknowledges that the homicide trend is “frightening” but insists that murders “have stayed far below their peaks” in earlier decades. In a “fact check” of “the ‘crime wave’ narrative police are pushing,” the Guardian reminds readers that “even after an estimated 25% single-year increase in homicides” in 2020, “Americans overall are much less likely to be killed today than they were in the 1990s, and the homicide rate across big cities is still close to half what it was a quarter century ago.”</td>

Yet on July 2, soon after the New York listing, Beijing’s Cyber Administration announced an investigation into Didi for potential violations of the country’s Data Security Law.</td>

      <td>The answer to poor judging is better judging, not deference to the political branches.</td>
      <td>In treating the advent of judicial review as a “radical development,” Judge Raymond Kethledge’s review of Randy Barnett and Evan Bernick’s “The Original Meaning of the 14th Amendment” (Bookshelf, Nov. 30) gets off on the wrong foot by privileging the right of self-government over that of individual liberty. The power of judges to overrule democratic decisions was at least implicit in the Declaration of Independence, where liberty comes first and self-government second, as a means toward liberty, but only as constrained by our written Constitution as interpreted by our courts. To hold otherwise is to render the majority a judge in its own case and strip the Constitution of its power to discipline we the people.<br />As I wrote here decades ago (“Rethinking Judicial Restraint,” op-ed, Feb. 1, 1991), Robert Bork, on whose authority Judge Kethledge draws, reversed that order. He, like Judge Kethledge, was a sometime originalist on unenumerated rights and judges' authority to recognize them. For the text of the Ninth Amendment, though broad, is clear. Unenumerated rights are not to be “denied or disparaged,” which is precisely what judicial deference to the political branches does. Pace Judge Kethledge, “unenumerated” does not mean “absent from the written Constitution.” Like privileges or immunities, due process and equal protection, unenumerated rights are in the Constitution’s text. Were we to deny or disparage those broad texts, as Bork often did, we would be at the mercy of state legislatures that have prohibited parochial school education, interracial marriage, vast forms of economic liberty and more.</td>

Over the course of the pandemic, there have been many variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but only a handful of note, including the Delta variant, and, most recently, the B.1.1.529 variant, also known as the Omicron variant. Most changes in the genetic code, or mutations, don’t really affect how the virus operates, but sometimes they can give the virus an advantage and allow it to spread more easily. Variants that are able to spread more efficiently become more prevalent, while others fizzle out.</td>

Demand was strong as consumers, armed with stimulus dollars and emboldened by vaccines, showed a healthy appetite for new clothes after a full year of lounging in pajamas and sweatpants. Through October, U.S. clothing and accessory stores have raked in almost 11% more revenue than in 2019, according to Census Bureau data. That is a remarkable expansion for an industry that eked out less than 1% growth in 2019. Retailers also were able to expand margins as a lack of inventory helped them to avoid discounts.

      <td>After a weekend in which three people were killed in Oakland, Calif., including a 1-year-old hit by a stray bullet while sleeping in the back seat of his mother’s car, Mayor Libby Schaaf finally reversed herself on defunding the police and pledged to hire more cops. But what took her so long?<br />Murder rose by nearly 30% last year, and Americans have been making it as clear as can be that they want more and better policing. The incoming mayors of Atlanta, New York and Seattle ran campaigns that prioritized public safety. A ballot initiative in Minneapolis that would have dismantled the police department was defeated soundly, and some of the strongest opposition came from low-income black communities. “Black lives need to be valued not just when unjustly taken by the police, but when we are alive and demanding our right to be heard, to breathe, to live in safe neighborhoods and to enjoy the full benefits of our status as American citizens,” explained a civil-rights activist from Minneapolis in a  New York Times  op-ed.</td>

      <td>This isn’t the 1980s. We don’t all watch the same TV shows, so right off we must specify the headline is a reference to a  Netflix  sitcom.<br />In the frequently hilarious “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” a 29-year-old woman from the Midwest, played by Ellie Kemper, has recently been freed after 15 years of living in an underground bunker, along with three other women, in a not fully explained relationship with a deranged pastor and doomsday cultist, played by the hunky Jon Hamm of “Mad Men” fame.</td>
