This 1920 law says cargo shipped domestically must travel via vessels built in the U.S. and 75% crewed by Americans. The Alaskan fish went aboard ships that don’t qualify.</td>

In 1987, Oprah Winfrey opened her show by announcing, “Research studies now project that 1 in 5—listen to me, hard to believe—1 in 5 heterosexuals could be dead of AIDS in the next three years.” The prediction was outlandishly wrong, but she wasn’t wrong in attributing the scare to scientists.</td>

The answer has a lot to do with the Federal Reserve’s continuing purchase of Treasury bonds, along with the $13 trillion in negative-yielding sovereign debt outstanding globally. In that context, the thinking goes, lending money to Uncle Sam for the next 10 years at 1.5% isn’t that bad a deal.</td>

I helped him prepare his speech, which was adapted into an op-ed for these pages. Shortly before the conference, Mr. Al-Hardan told me he was worried about the threats that would inevitably follow.

ACLU executive director Anthony Romero told the New York Times that in the future the group “won’t be altering people’s quotes.”<br />But it will surely find more palatable ways to hedge the word, because doing so has become a progressive point of order. House Democrats qualified the word “woman” in a September bill by saying the term reflects “the identity of the majority of people” who might seek an abortion: “This Act is intended to protect all people with the capacity for pregnancy—cisgender women, transgender men, non-binary individuals, those who identify with a different gender, and others.”</td>

Violent crime remains high as the criminal-justice system struggles to keep up.<br />Although it will take another year to get a full picture of 2021, the preliminary data from big U.S. cities is grim. Data collected by the firm AH Datalytics shows that homicide is up, year to date, in two-thirds of the nearly 90 cities it covers. In some jurisdictions, violence is down relative to 2020, but still dramatically elevated relative to 2019. In New York City, for example, there were 53 murders in August, down from 58 in August 2020—but up from 36 in August 2019.</td>

Last I knew, she had become a hub connecting military pets with safe temporary homes. A group in Wisconsin bought a handicap-accessible utility task vehicle to enable veterans who are disabled to access nature trails. Members in Connecticut work with the Veterans Affairs unit for the blind to provide quarters so those veterans can learn how to operate laundromat equipment. None of these members set out to start a movement, but in some cases it happened anyway. Lots of people doing small acts adds up to improved lives for our military families.</td>

I bunked, ate, drank and flew with my squadron. One day in February 1971, one of the back seaters in the squadron gave me some unsolicited advice. He asked if I ever flew gunship escorts and I responded that I did and was scheduled for just such a mission three nights hence. He continued: Was I in the habit of looking back at the antiaircraft gun that we had just attacked as we were climbing back to altitude? I said I had never done that, and he noted that smart enemy gunners knew that we rolled left as we climbed and, while they could not see us, they would tail-shoot our aircraft if our suppression was off. I thanked him for the unbidden advice and have spent 50 years now offering thanks.</td>

      <td>Along with skinny jeans, the side part has become a sign of being out of touch with the zeitgeist. At the spring 2022 fashion shows in New York and Europe, the center part continues its mighty reign.</td>
      <td>“PROVE ME WRONG, but I don’t think there is a single person that looks better with a side part than they do a middle part,” said Glorianna Restrepo in a viral TikTok video she posted in July 2020. Ms. Restrepo, a 24-year-old Connecticut photographer, went on in the clip to extol the “luscious, elegant” and “supreme” center part. Her voice, recorded under the track “Middle Part Baddies,” became a popular soundtrack for other TikTok videos on the strangely sensational topic of center parts versus middle parts. According to TikTok logic, side parts and skinny jeans are for out-of-touch millennials, while center parts and baggier “mom jeans” are for cool Gen-Z kids. In playfully contentious videos, millennials defend their skinny-jean-side-parted turf, while Gen-Z trendsetters mock them. These subtle differences in hair division and denim fit have become an inescapable generational lightning rod.<br />The middle part appears to have won the battle, at least for now. As the fashion industry rears its glossy head with a full slate of in-person shows in New York and Europe after multiple sleepy seasons of digital presentations, we’re seeing the tiny insidious ways in which our time at home has informed trends. There are the editors who have forsaken high heels after nearly two years in Birkenstocks. A few sneaky elastic waists have crept into the front row. And then there’s our collective dependence on TikTok and Instagram to tell us what’s in and out. Ms. Restrepo, whose original middle-part video has nearly 100,000 likes, said, “I think the trend cycle, the past year specifically, has gotten so crazy out of proportion because of social media.”</td>

In itself, 2% is no biggie: three days this year had bigger falls, and on average we have had seven worse days a year since 1964.<br />What bothers me is that the rise in bond yields that triggered the fall was really quite small, and there could easily be a lot more to come. The 10-year Treasury yield rose only 0.05 percentage point, taking it above 1.5%, and the 30-year rose slightly more to just above 2%. If this is the sort of response we should expect, then get out your tin hat. Yields need to rise four times as much just to get back to where they were in March.</td>

It is here that the river decants into the Sea of Okhotsk with a “sense of thwarted purpose”—as if “all human life dwindled away at its colossal estuary.”</td>

I’m definitely the crazy person in town.”<br />Starting in August, the veterinarian begins constructing the frights at his home on Irving Avenue (named for Washington Irving, Tarrytown’s most famous resident and the author of “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow”). Every year, Mr. Klock erects a 14-by-20-foot tent in his driveway to function as a compact, but full-fledged haunted house. This year, he’s styling the tent as the laboratory of “Regenerwrong” (a play on the maker of an antibody treatment used for Covid-19). In his fictional back story, the lab’s mission was to create a real-life Spider-Man, but, as he explains, “It’s a bad laboratory. Things have gone wrong.” Workers bitten by the lab’s experimental arachnids become half-human, half-spider radioactive zombie mutants.</td>

We need to ensure all Americans have a safety net that provides paid leave so they can recover from illness or injury, bond with a new child or care for a sick loved one.<br />The editorial suggests that employers will steer clear of private paid leave if they have the public option. This is not the case. The Ways and Means Committee’s proposal creates a private-public partnership that provides basic coverage to everyone and gives employers the choice to leverage the government program or build a private plan, based on their needs and ability to do more. We see many of our clients choosing to offer richer benefits, even when a state paid leave program is in place.

Coolidge’s decisive action: “There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, any time.”<br />Coolidge showed that in a public emergency a conservative Republican could boldly assert the primacy of the broad public interest over private action—a lesson that some current Republican governors would do well to keep in mind as our nation continues to fight the coronavirus.</td>

When the painting went on view in January 1922, after the Duke of Westminster sold it to art dealer Joseph Duveen, who resold it to the American Henry E. Huntington, “great crowds almost stormed” the National Gallery in London for a last look, according to contemporary accounts; some 90,000 people visited it during its three-week exhibition there.<br />Next Jan. 25, exactly 100 years later, “The Blue Boy” will again be shown at the National Gallery, on loan (until May 15, 2022) for the first time ever from the Huntington Library, Art Museum and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, Calif., which the railroad and real-estate magnate created as a public institution in 1919.

      <td>German Catholic bishops and lay leaders on Friday called for their church to bless same-sex relationships, challenging a Vatican ban on the practice.<br />The move raised pressure on Pope Francis to respond to the Germans’ progressive drive, which conservatives have warned could split the world-wide church.</td>

      <td>Four New York City teachers have filed a petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to block the city’s vaccine mandate, which requires school employees to be vaccinated to be able to work on Monday.<br />The 12-page petition filed Thursday argues that the mandate violates the teachers’ constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. The teachers’ lawyers say that other city employees are allowed to opt out of the mandate if they submit to weekly Covid-19 tests.</td>

      <td>With leather, combat boots and plenty of attitude, fall’s curiously popular ‘punk ballerina’ trend, seen at Simone Rocha and Alexander McQueen, takes tutus to a dark, decadent and surprisingly wearable place.</td>
      <td>“I’M AN ANGRY punk princess who loves sneakers,” said Andrea Cacho. On any given day, you might find the New York University music-business student sporting spiked metal jewelry, black high-tops, a black vest, and one of the three frothy tulle skirts she owns in black, white and yellow. She’s stoked to mix in her leather jacket and Skittle-hued stockings once the weather cools. Inspired by old-school Madonna (“She’s hardcore”) and modern artists like Bikini Kill and Willow Smith, Ms. Cacho, 19, adopted her new look this summer. It reflects the “toughness and anger” she feels after a difficult pandemic year. Sure, but a tutu? “Who says I can’t be feminine and tough and strong?” she asked, rhetorically.<br />In recent months, the “punk ballerina” look—a leather-and-frill-laden mashup that’s one part Hell’s Angels, one part “Swan Lake”—has jetéd from the runway to the red carpet (see Cyndi Lauper’s VMAs look, and also everything she wore in the 1980s) to women’s closets. For fall 2021,  Christian Dior  paired diaphanous skirts with hefty combat boots; Alexander McQueen sells various tulle and leather pieces, like a zipper-trimmed-ruffle biker jacket; and at Noir Kei Ninomiya’s Tokyo show, models in bulbous mesh skirts and black bombers pierced by metallic quills looked like goth porcupines—unnerving, but attractive.</td>

      <td>The pandemic is the latest challenge and opportunity for the personal computing veteran in a career that began in the 1980s.</td>
      <td>A decade ago, the rise of smartphones and tablets seemed to spell doom for the  Dell  computer company, which had tried to enter both markets without success. (Does anyone remember the “phablet”?) By 2012 Dell’s market share for PCs had eroded to just over 10%, and its share price had sunk below $9, from around $30 in 2007.<br />“I felt abandoned by the public shareholders,” admits Michael Dell, the company’s founder and CEO, in his new autobiography, “Play Nice But Win,” published next week. But Dell’s historically low stock price also offered a silver lining. With help from Silver Lake, a private-equity firm, in 2013 Mr. Dell paid $24.9 billion to take his company private. This rare maneuver freed him to transform his company “without the tyranny, the ever-ticking shot clock, of a quarterly earnings report,” he writes.</td>

Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said 79% of pregnant or lactating women screened over the past week in Tigray, which has been at war with Ethiopia’s government for almost a year, were suffering from acute malnutrition. Nearly one in five children under the age of 5 were also moderately malnourished, with 2.4% of children severely malnourished, the report said.</td>
