Tesla only produced about half a million cars in all of 2020. The Model 3 sells for about $40,000.

Despite vociferous Israeli protest, the State Department has repeatedly said it would push forward with opening a consulate anyway, and Secretary Antony Blinken will personally lead the effort.<br />The U.S. Embassy to Israel is already in Jerusalem, and it has a consular department that provides services to Palestinians. Opening a separate, independent diplomatic mission would undermine a longstanding bipartisan policy of treating Jerusalem as the exclusive capital of Israel.</td>

      <td>As fascism rose in the 1930s, it was reviled, embraced or misunderstood by U.S. ambassadors in Berlin, Moscow, London, Paris and Rome.</td>
      <td>As we look back on the 1930s and the conflicts that proved to be a prelude to war, it is natural to focus on the decisions of national leaders. But diplomatic relations took place at a less exalted level, too—in far-flung consulates and embassies. David McKean, an ambassador to Luxembourg in the final year of the Obama administration, had the good idea of tracking America’s response to Germany’s rise by describing the milieu of America’s ambassadors and by assessing the policies they pursued and the actions they took. In “Watching Darkness Fall,” he tells the story largely through the eyes of the men who represented the U.S. in London, Moscow, Berlin, Paris and Rome during the pivotal early years of Franklin Roosevelt’s administration.<br />Of the half-dozen ambassadors most prominently on display, William Dodd comes across as the book’s hero. Dodd served unhappily in Berlin from 1933 to 1937, regularly expressing his antipathy to Hitler and his government. Soon after he arrived, Hitler decreed that the Nazis were the only political party in Germany, and his cabinet authorized a series of draconian policies. In his first letter to Roosevelt, the ambassador made a comment that has resonance today: “The [German] people have never learned the give-and-take of group compromises, which English and Americans always apply.” Dodd dutifully attended the 1936 Berlin Olympics, a showcase for the Nazis, but refused to attend their rallies or host German officials in the embassy. Oddly, Mr. McKean never mentions that Dodd’s daughter not only shared his disgust but also spied for the Soviet Union, falling in love with a Russian agent and feeding him information about her father’s activities and his correspondence with Roosevelt.</td>

The Modi government is not only privatizing state-owned enterprises but also overhauling taxes, relaxing foreign direct investment (FDI) rules and deregulating labor and agriculture markets.<br />The Indian Parliament recently voted to abolish retroactive taxation, giving foreign investors a favorable, predictable climate for capital accumulation. Investors received additional succor when the FDI caps in the insurance and telecom sectors were lifted. With labor reforms, India’s notoriously strident unions have been chastened; they must now issue two-months notice before striking, and firms need fewer approvals from the government for redeploying labor. Thanks to agriculture liberalization, Indian farmers are free to engage in contract farming and can sell directly to private buyers instead of through government-controlled stockyards. India further reduced the cost of doing business by cutting corporate tax rates to 15% from 25% for start-ups, and to 22% from 30% for established companies.</td>

She became known as “America’s sweetheart” during her 15 years co-anchoring the Today Show before taking over CBS Evening News then hosting her own daytime show, Katie, on ABC. In the book, she recounts interviewing momentous figures including Barbara and George H.W. Bush, David Duke, John F. Kennedy Jr. and Sarah Palin, and she writes openly about losing her first husband, Jay Monahan, and her sister, Emily Couric, to cancer. The chapters she spends on the sexual assault allegations against her former Today co-host Matt Lauer offer a look into the experience of finding out the worst about someone you cared about and trusted.</td>
