      <td>The Food and Drug Administration evaluates drugs for safety and efficacy, but now the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services wants to act as a political check on the FDA’s decisions. Last week CMS refused to cover a novel Alzheimer’s treatment for millions of patients because it disagreed with FDA approval.<br />Biogen ’s  Aduhelm is the first FDA-approved treatment shown to slow the progression of Alzheimer's. But the drug is now ensnared in a political fight. The public-health left thinks FDA is approving too many new expensive drugs with marginal benefits, and it wants CMS to overrule the drug agency. Progressives are cheering CMS’s Aduhelm decision as a precedent that the agency can restrict access to new FDA-approved treatments. Aduhelm is the target today, but cancer and gene therapies could be next.</td>

Fine if he wants to poke lawmakers to control illegal migration, but why is he also punishing Americans by obstructing legal commerce?<br />Last week Mr. Abbott directed state troopers to inspect trucks crossing his state’s southern border for human trafficking, weapons and drugs. He was responding to the Administration’s coming withdrawal of Title 42, a pandemic policy that has allowed the feds to expel undocumented immigrants, including asylum claimants apprehended at the border.</td>

The shooting shocked New Yorkers because it happened in the city’s central nervous system—and because it symbolizes the larger and steep decline in law and order.<br />Mr. James, whose YouTube videos suggest he is furious at the world and perhaps mentally ill, allegedly set off a smoke bomb in a subway car and shot and wounded 10 people. It’s a miracle no one was killed. Subway cameras failed, and Mr. James eluded police for 30 hours before he was arrested walking in Manhattan. Police said he will be charged with committing a terrorist act.</td>

      <td>Russian Gen. Aleksandr Dvornikov is a ruthless commander with an established record of vicious brutality.</td>
      <td>After horrendous battlefield losses and failed objectives, Vladimir Putin is concentrating his efforts in Ukraine in the eastern provinces of the Donbas. Recognizing that neither his original plan for a blitzkrieg against Kyiv nor his plan for multiple operations in the north, south and east worked, Russia’s president seems ready now to embrace longstanding principles of war: simplicity, unity of effort and focused logistics. No more adventurous airborne operations against airfields. No more stymied convoys or simultaneous but separate attacks on Kharkiv, Mariupol and Sumy. No more disputes among commanders over logistical resupply. Rather, the Russians will pursue a single coordinated effort with, initially, more-limited aspirations in the Donbas.<br />Unity of command has long been recognized as an indispensable prerequisite for victory. Battlefield directions will no longer emanate from the Kremlin or Moscow but from a field headquarters. Mr. Putin’s recent appointment of Gen. Aleksandr Dvornikov to command all forces in Ukraine is consistent with the principle of unity of command. It’s also worrisome. Unlike Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, a politician-cum-general, and Gen. Valery Gerasimov, reputedly the designer of the original attack plan for Ukraine, Gen. Dvornikov is not a staff officer in Moscow. He is a seasoned combat veteran with previous responsibility for operations in Chechnya, Crimea and Armenia.</td>

Data calculated by Harbor Aluminum for the Beer Institute, to be released Thursday, show that U.S. beverage manufacturers have since paid an equivalent of $1.4 billion in Section 232 aluminum tariffs through February 2022.</td>

Today these dynasties are worth billions.<br />“Over the past fifty years,” Mr. de Jong writes, “German political leaders haven’t shied away from taking moral responsibility and acknowledging the sins of the past,” not least the atrocities perpetrated during the Nazi regime. Not so these five dynasties, which, over time and across generations, Mr. de Jong tells us, have deflected or excused themselves from accountability. They have obfuscated their connections to companies that armed and fed the soldiers of the Third Reich; that used slave laborers from Nazi concentration and prisoner-of-war camps; or that were acquired through Aryanization—the Nazi euphemism for the forced takeover of Jewish-owned businesses for a pittance of their worth. In this meticulously researched book, Mr. de Jong, an investigative journalist and former reporter at Bloomberg News, compels us to confront the current-day legacy of these Nazi ties.</td>

In his third Slow Food Fast recipe, Mr. Hereford offers a streamlined version of “The Wedge,” as it’s called in his forthcoming cookbook. But all the key elements are here: crisp iceberg lettuce, a scrumptious buttermilk blue cheese dressing, cherry tomatoes, warm bacon bits, fresh dill. An everything-bagel topping adds crunch.<br />“The thing we didn’t know when we were first testing was just how much everything-bagel topping this can take,” Mr. Hereford said. “And it can take A LOT. We pack it on!” He does not recommend buying the everything-bagel seasoning pre-jarred, however. “You can’t control the salt level and balance,” he said. His own potent mix includes poppy seeds, sesame seeds, and dried garlic and onion. “I’m not big on subtle flavors,” the chef said. “I have no restraint.”</td>

Midway through, tears overtook them and they could not go on. Their country’s dream of a democratic future was being crushed by Soviet tanks, and the world was standing by, doing nothing. This was a powerful early memory and remains a stark lesson in the weakness of the international community in the face of naked aggression.</td>

In her dissenting opinion, Justice Elena Kagan attributed different reasoning to the majority, also entirely plausible. The public has no way to know for which reasons the majority made its decision because it didn’t give any.<br />Justice Amy Coney Barrett made a speech at the Reagan Library on April 4. She referenced the bitter public debate about the legitimacy of the Supreme Court and the increasing tendency to think of it as a group of politicians in robes. Her message was clear and important. She urged the public to “read the opinion” to determine whether the Court made a political decision or a legal decision.</td>

      <td>Professional soldiers like the Wagner Group let clients wage war brutally at minimal political cost.</td>
      <td>Germany’s foreign-intelligence service recently intercepted secret messages confirming Russian mercenaries known as the Wagner Group played a leading role in the massacre in Bucha, Ukraine. For those who track the Wagner Group, this was expected. In recent years, it has become Vladimir Putin’s weapon of choice because it offers plausible deniability. Hiring mercenaries is a foolproof way to confound international laws prohibiting savagery in war. The Wagner Group has left a trail of atrocities everywhere it’s gone: Syria, Libya, the Central African Republic, Mali and now Ukraine. And other nations are following Moscow’s example.<br />It’s impossible to know for certain whether the Wagner Group’s brutality is the work of rogue warriors or Russian policy, but it is plausible it’s the latter. Coercion and terror are a time-tested imperial strategy for pacification, from the First Jewish-Roman War (66-73) to the Second Chechen War (1999-2000), during which Mr. Putin flattened Grozny. When the fighting was over, the city looked like Stalingrad after the Nazi’s five-month siege—post-apocalyptic, with only skeletal buildings left standing and scorched rubble burying unknown dead. Immoral but effective, Mr. Putin’s bombardment ended the war in Russia’s favor.</td>

We’re happy to recount his logic since politicians in Sacramento are clearly in need of legal instruction.<br />The Legislature’s premise for its diversity mandate was that corporate directors tend to select replacements who look like them, resulting in homogenous boards. Ergo, all public companies headquartered in the state were ordered to include at least one member of an “underrepresented” race, ethnicity or sexual orientation, and two to three for larger boards.</td>

The most harshly restrictive Covid policies have recently collapsed. With any luck, we’ll soon be able to say the same about over-the-top climate policies.<br />Governments often go overboard when responding to new threats, and policy makers’ response to Covid mirrored their continuing overreaction to global warming. In both cases they have failed to pursue mitigation strategies that minimize total harm to society. The initial policy response to Covid caused social and economic harms that, in the aggregate, proved worse than the disease itself. Likewise, discussions about the total harm from rising global temperatures often ignore the costs associated with preventing warming.</td>

And the Post does. Instead it justifies the suppression by saying that, because the press was the “unwitting tools of a Russian influence campaign in 2016,” it was “only prudent to suspect a similar plot lay behind the mysterious appearance of a computer stuffed with juicy documents and conveniently handed over to President Donald Trump’s toxic personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani.”</td>

Under pressure from Congress, President Biden belatedly banned Russian oil, natural-gas and coal imports. But he continues to ignore the fuel powering 20% of U.S. electricity generation—uranium. More than 90% of the uranium that fuels U.S. power plants is imported, and Russia is the third-largest supplier. In 2021 Russian imports cost almost $1 billion, money that helped underwrite Mr. Putin’s war machine.</td>

      <td>The child welfare system can operate inefﬁciently and heavy-handedly, but is it really a threat to black families?</td>

Of those children, 34.9% were black, though blacks make up only 13% of the U.S. population. Black children were three times as likely to die from maltreatment as white children, and the number had gone up 17% from the year before.<br />These are not the racial disparities that concern Dorothy Roberts. A law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Ms. Roberts has long argued that the disproportionate danger to black children in this country comes not from abusive parents or other caretakers but from the child welfare system itself. In “Torn Apart,” she says that, just as it is time to end the “prison industrial complex,” it is time to eliminate the public agencies charged with detecting which children are in danger and, if necessary, removing them from the situation that threatens them, sometimes placing them in foster care.</td>

      <td>Josh Brolin stars as a rancher who has to deal with a hectic family life and eerie happenings on his land.</td>
      <td>Galloping out of a wilder west, “Outer Range” certainly corrals one’s attention, wrangling a herd of plotlines into just the first of eight episodes. Among the extended family of rancher Royal Abbott (Josh Brolin), a daughter-in-law has disappeared without a trace; her daughter is suddenly motherless, her husband shaken. Another son has a rodeo career on the ropes. A sexy, spacey, hippie poet with a suspicious amount of money is camping on one end of the family spread, unsettling Royal’s stoical self—though not as much as the very round, very large hole he’s discovered at the other end of his vast Wyoming acreage, which may be a portal into the abyss.<br />Birds are leaving their roosts at night; steer are vanishing; a kind of winter light is persistent over Wyoming, and there are burps in Royal’s personal space-time continuum. The creator of “Outer Range,” newcomer Brian Watkins, is clearly striving for a gothic-in-the-great-outdoors atmosphere and is successful at it, even without the portal. And, by the way, what is this swirling pool of vaporous mystery into which Royal dumps a body in the opening moments of the series? (This is not a spoiler; disclosing where the body goes would be a spoiler.) We don’t know, nor does Royal, though he wants to keep the hole—and the several hundred acres around it—out of the hands of his acquisitive, unhinged neighbor Wayne Tillerson (Will Patton), who when not slurping Clamato juice is plotting legal ways of seizing Royal’s land. Maybe just because he can.</td>

Think formaldehyde in hair products, or asbestos in makeup. The central premise of this four-part exposé by the longtime activist documentarians Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering is that the effect of the lotions, lacquers, hair relaxers and cosmetics—the things people apply directly to their most immediate physical environment—is like the burning of the rainforest or a BP oil spill in your bathroom. Some of the people in “Not So Pretty” could be declared Superfund sites.<br />The filmmakers, including narrator Keke Palmer, don’t pretend that “Not So Pretty” is anything other than an advocacy documentary (as was the last Dick-Ziering project, “Allen v. Farrow,” albeit for entirely different reasons). While the manufacturers involved deny that any of their products are harmful, the series encourages viewers who believe themselves to have been afflicted by toxic substances to seek help (information provided in subtitles). It also urges viewers to lobby their elected representatives on regulatory reform. One element that binds all four segments of “Not So Pretty” is its claim that the most personal products are under the least amount of control by the FDA. This may come as a shock.</td>

I contacted Speer, who had recently published “Inside the Third Reich,” and he agreed to meet. I asked what he considered the greatest threat facing the world. Sitting in Heidelberg, only 120 miles from the Fulda gap, where several Warsaw Pact armies with tactical nuclear weapons were poised to storm across West Germany, I naturally expected the threat of nuclear war to be his response. Instead, he replied: “Pollution.”<br />At first, I thought this was a formulaic response that he believed young American college students like me would appreciate hearing. But he actually meant it. I found myself in the odd position of trying to persuade him, of all people, of the more immediate danger of global war if our enemies perceived military weakness in NATO. He seemed unconvinced.</td>

The shoes’ appearance in the fall Miu Miu show last month, paired with scrunched-up tube socks and hip-slung tennis skirts, suggests this is a trend with legs.<br />It was designer Hedi Slimane who first prominently put the ballerina-inspired shoe back onto the runway in his spring 2021 collection for Celine. Meanwhile, indie sleaze Instagram accounts have been documenting the hipster aesthetic of the mid-noughties—think Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs—a time now viewed as a more innocent, golden age of style, when party girls like Kate Moss wore Repetto Cendrillon ballet flats. Throw in a collective disenchantment with the lumbering boots and sneakers that have been stomping down the fashion landscape for the past three years and the stage was set for the ballet-flat revival.</td>

Inflation ran 8.5% in the year ending last month, while nominal wages grew only 5.6%, a decline in inflation-adjusted wages of 2.7%. This presents a serious challenge to the “hot economy” thesis that tighter labor markets lead to rising real wages. This idea has never been as popular among academic economists as it is among Washington policy makers. A hot economy is surely better than a cold one, but the costs of an overheating economy might be larger than policy makers have appreciated.<br />The hot-economy thesis has been a staple of Beltway economists from both the left and the right and has been frequently cited by Federal Reserve officials. The idea is simple: When the unemployment rate falls, workers have more leverage to negotiate higher wages. Job growth benefits not only the newly employed, but also those already working.</td>
