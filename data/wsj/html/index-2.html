The U.S. found itself injecting thousands of troops back into Afghanistan in recent days to try to evacuate Americans and their allies before the Taliban seal the exits.<br />Much like U.S. Marines burned sensitive documents on the roof of the Saigon embassy in 1975, American commandos in Kabul broke hard drives full of classified material on Sunday to keep them out of Taliban hands, according to a U.S. military official.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—While Biden administration officials sought to cast blame on the Trump administration and Afghan forces for the fall of Kabul, the withdrawal of U.S. troops is creating a set of new problems that will now be even harder to manage.<br />U.S. officials have said they must continue to monitor the rise of new terrorist risks in the region, and hope to protect the gains women and girls have made in Afghanistan. There are also concerns about foreign adversaries attempting to fill the void left by the American departure, and there is the question of what happens to the military equipment left behind.<br />Some of those issues were raised by lawmakers in Sunday briefings with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Others were addressed in media appearances in which Mr. Blinken sought to defend the president’s policy.<br />Mr. Blinken expressed hope that the Taliban would safeguard human rights, including those of women, if it assumes power in the coming days in order to gain wide international recognition and secure the easing of sanctions.<br />“Ultimately, it is in the Taliban’s self-interest,” Mr. Blinken said on ABC’s “This Week.” “If they’re in a position of power and they don’t do that, then I think Afghanistan will become a pariah state.”</td>

Like many travel-related companies, Apple Leisure’s business got clobbered by virus-related lockdowns and travel bans last year, but it has rebounded as restrictions have loosened.<br />For Chicago-based Hyatt, one of the world’s biggest hospitality companies, the deal would bolster its already considerable resort-management portfolio and give it one of the biggest U.S. providers of charter flights and vacation packages for travel to Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the Caribbean.<br />It also would accelerate Hyatt’s transformation, long under way, to a more asset-light business model, focusing on generating an ongoing stream of steady and predictable fees.</td>

      <td>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM, features nearly 300 diagnoses. What’s the science behind it?</td>
      <td>Among the many costs of the pandemic lockdowns and school closures, as both proponents and opponents of these measures agree, is an upsurge in reported cases of mental illness. But underneath this consensus lurks uncertainty about what’s meant by “mental illness.” If there really is a mental-health crisis, then doctors—psychiatrists—should have a lead role in responding to it. Rutgers sociologist Allan V. Horwitz’s history of the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,” or DSM—the medical field’s definitive classification of mental disorders—explores psychiatry’s claim to such authority.<br />“DSM: A History of Psychiatry’s Bible” puts forward two arguments: first, that the DSM is a “social creation”; second, that we’re stuck with it. Throughout much of its history, psychiatry didn’t display a strong interest in precise and variegated definitions of mental disorders. The discipline recognized broad categories of mental breakdown—mania, melancholia, dementia, idiocy—but more precise diagnoses weren’t thought necessary. The DSM was first published in 1952, but it wasn’t widely used until after the third edition was released in 1980. The current edition, the fifth—published in 2013—features almost 300 distinct diagnoses.<br />The DSM now permeates American society. You see it in the widespread, casual use of such terms as “bipolar disorder” and “autism spectrum.” One key player in the DSM’s rise to influence was the insurance industry. As insurance companies became involved in paying for mental-health care, they needed a standard by which to parse which disorders’ treatment merited reimbursement and which did not. They turned to the DSM. Clinicians were at first skeptical about how well the DSM’s classifications reflected their patients’ needs and conditions. But over time clinicians, too, became wedded to it for fear that any major modification might jeopardize their ability to get paid.<br />A formal diagnosis facilitates access to services, so parents came to rely on the DSM’s multiplying diagnoses and resisted any changes that might diminish that access. Drug companies haven’t directly influenced the DSM’s contents, Mr. Horwitz observes, but they have contributed to its popularization. In the early 1970s, the Food and Drug Administration started requiring pharmaceutical companies to stipulate, in ad campaigns, which specific diagnoses their products treated. Drug ads made household names out of DSM diagnoses that, often enough, patients now give to themselves before setting foot in a clinician’s office.<br />Mr. Horwitz persuasively critiques the underlying vagueness of the DSM’s approach to classifying disorders, but he is himself at times vague about how far he wants to press that critique. Where to draw the line between challenging the scientific basis of the DSM and the scientific basis of psychiatry itself? At times he seems to doubt whether the anti-psychiatry movement has ever been adequately refuted. But in the past undermining psychiatry has tended to make worse off those Americans who, without question, suffer from incapacitating psychiatric disorders. Somewhere around 500,000 severely mentally ill people are either institutionalized, incarcerated or homeless. Unless we’re going to tell such vulnerable people to snap out of it and get a job, psychiatry has a place in American society.</td>

      <td>The President tries to duck responsibility for a calamitous withdrawal.</td>
      <td>President Biden’s statement on Saturday washing his hands of Afghanistan deserves to go down as one of the most shameful in history by a Commander in Chief at such a moment of American retreat. As the Taliban closed in on Kabul, Mr. Biden sent a confirmation of U.S. abandonment that absolved himself of responsibility, deflected blame to his predecessor, and more or less invited the Taliban to take over the country.<br />With that statement of capitulation, the Afghan military’s last resistance collapsed. Taliban fighters captured Kabul, and President Ashraf Ghani fled the country while the U.S. frantically tried to evacuate Americans. The jihadists the U.S. toppled 20 years ago for sheltering Osama bin Laden will now fly their flag over the U.S. Embassy building on the 20th anniversary of 9/11.<br />Our goal all along has been to offer constructive advice to avoid this outcome. We criticizedDonald Trump’s deal with the Taliban and warned about the risks of his urge to withdraw in a rush, and we did the same for Mr. Biden. The President’s advisers offered an alternative, as did the Afghanistan Study Group. Mr. Biden, as always too assured of his own foreign-policy acumen, refused to listen.<br />Mr. Biden’s Saturday self-justification exemplifies his righteous dishonesty. “One more year, or five more years, of U.S. military presence would not have made a difference if the Afghan military cannot or will not hold its own country,” Mr. Biden said. But the Afghans were willing to fight and take casualties with the support of the U.S. and its NATO allies, especially air power. A few thousand troops and contractors could have done the job and prevented this rout.<br />Worse is his attempt to blame his decisions on Mr. Trump: “When I came to office, I inherited a deal cut by my predecessor—which he invited the Taliban to discuss at Camp David on the eve of 9/11 of 2019—that left the Taliban in the strongest position militarily since 2001 and imposed a May 1, 2021 deadline on U.S. forces. Shortly before he left office, he also drew U.S. forces down to a bare minimum of 2,500. Therefore, when I became President, I faced a choice—follow through on the deal, with a brief extension to get our Forces and our allies’ forces out safely, or ramp up our presence and send more American troops to fight once again in another country’s civil conflict.”</td>

The U.S., the international community and the Afghan government must do everything we can to protect women and girls from inhumane treatment by the Taliban,” Mrs. Pelosi said.<br />But the “international community” was doing precisely that by maintaining a modest allied force and air power in Afghanistan. Now they’re gone, and we can see what will happen to the women and girls of that country.<br />“Any political settlement that the Afghans pursue to avert bloodshed must include having women at the table,” the Speaker added. Gotta love that “must.” That should impress the Taliban as it closes schools for girls, forces marriages to Taliban fighters, and bars women from public or prominent commercial life.<br />Mrs. Pelosi is so used to giving political lectures she doesn’t seem to realize she is detached from reality.</td>

But tens of thousands of other Afghans who assisted the U.S. over 20 years aren’t so fortunate and now face a potentially gruesome fate.<br />The speed of the Taliban offensive caught the Biden Administration by surprise, but it can’t say it wasn’t warned to move faster on visas and exit plans for Afghan translators, journalists and their families. Former U.S. military officers sounded the alarm, as did Members of Congress. There’s no excuse for the scenes of fear and chaos on Sunday at the civilian wing of Kabul’s airport that had Afghans trying to flee without military protection as the Taliban closed in.<br />One of those sounding the alarm has been James Miervaldis, a U.S. Army vet who served in Afghanistan and Iraq and is now chairman of No One Left Behind. The nonprofit has been trying to fill the vacuum left by the U.S. State Department by negotiating and financing the exit of families who have been lucky enough to obtain U.S. visas.<br />On Sunday morning New York time, Mr. Miervaldis told us that his group had 50 families with some 250 people scheduled to leave Kabul on commercial flights. But they were stuck when commercial flights were halted. He said U.S. military flights appeared to be taking only big shots or U.S. Embassy personnel, and no one knows if or when the Taliban will allow commercial flights to leave.<br />He said U.S. military units contacted his group to obtain information on what is going on at the airport because they had been provided no on-the-ground intelligence. This is unforgivable, and the incompetence of the U.S. is stunning. “It is mind-blowing, the lack of preparation,” Mr. Miervaldis said.</td>

      <td>In late June, a stark new intelligence estimate said the government of President Ashraf Ghani could collapse in as soon as six months after the U.S. withdrew its troops from Afghanistan.<br />By last week, with the Taliban rapidly taking over provincial capitals, a revised estimate gave the Ghani government as little as a month to survive. On Sunday, Mr. Ghani fled the country as Taliban troops entered Kabul.<br />In recent days, Biden administration officials publicly and privately expressed their surprise at how quickly the Taliban were moving through the country, overtaking one provincial capital after another while Afghan forces barely put up a fight.<br />A U.S. official dismissed the notion that only intelligence failures were to blame for the swift collapse of the Afghanistan government, saying a number of factors contributed to the miscalculation, including the speed of the Biden administration’s withdrawal and the fact that the military contractors left as well.<br />​According to an administration official, military planners believed that “speed equals safety.” “Once we made the decision to go, it was important that we go efficiently, to protect our forces,” the official added. “Our departure timeline was clearly communicated to all parties, including Afghan forces and our partners.”</td>

      <td>Was the coronavirus manipulated to infect humans? If so, that will inform our response.</td>
      <td>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wasn’t allowed to visit the city of Wuhan, China, or the Wuhan Institute of Virology in early 2020. We’ve been trying to find out why ever since. Had we encountered transparency rather than stonewalling, it wouldn’t have been necessary to put together the circumstantial pieces of the puzzle on our own.<br />On Sept. 12, 2019, coronavirus bat sequences were deleted from the institute’s database. Why? It changed the security protocols for the lab. Why? It put out requests for more than $600 million for a new ventilation system. What prompted this new need?<br />In January 2020 two hypotheses emerged about the origin of the novel coronavirus: that it began in a bat, then infected another animal before spreading to humans in a Wuhan “wet market,” where wild animals are sold for meat; or that it emerged from the Wuhan laboratory. The wet-market story was pushed by the Chinese CDC and the World Health Organization. Public-health leaders argued that Covid-19 was like SARS and MERS, earlier coronaviruses that emerged from bats and spread through an intermediate animal.<br />But neither of those viruses has ever evolved to the point where it can transmit efficiently from one human to the next. There have been fewer than 10,000 cases of each virus world-wide since SARS was discovered in 2003 and MERS in 2012. What virus comes out of a bat cave and infects humans by the millions? It’s not biologically plausible. If instead it evolved slowly over many years in nature, how come no one knew of it?<br />One of the lab theories hypothesizes that SARS-CoV-2 was manipulated or “taught” to infect humans. Imagine several viruses being run through humanized mice (grafted with human tissue and immune cells) to test their ability to infect human tissue. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 includes a kind of cleavage site that allows its spike protein to change its orientation and dock more easily with a human cell.</td>

Yet Team Biden is still having trouble delineating a policy that actively supports the popular cry for self-governance. It’s enough to make one wonder if regime change is an administration priority.<br />In the days and weeks to come, White House positions regarding remittances to the island and the use of the Magnitsky Act to impose sanctions at the very top of the regime could go a long way in resolving those doubts.<br />Divergent objectives inside the Democratic Party are slowing things down. Moderates, Hispanics in Florida and New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez want the administration to side with the Cuban people.<br />But Mr. Biden’s progressive flank remains faithful to its beloved “revolution.” Some, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, continue to spout Havana’s totalitarian talking points. “The embargo is absurdly cruel,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in a July 15 statement, “and, like too many other U.S. policies targeting Latin Americans, the cruelty is the point.”<br />This is nonsense. The regime can buy all the food and medicine it wants from the U.S. and can freely trade with the rest of the world. Havana’s ruling mafia doesn’t like the embargo because it means Cuba can’t get credit from American banks and largess from multilateral organizations like the World Bank.</td>

But Mr. de Blasio’s mandate is a clear government overreach. Still YouTube removed the video, citing an alleged violation, never explained, of its “medical misinformation policy.” The video was censored for two days. After I appealed YouTube’s decision twice, the video reappeared and I was notified that after “taking another look,” YouTube had changed its mind.<br />Behind the platforms, the people deciding what is “misinformation” and a violation of “community guidelines” are doing so in a subjective manner. Social-media giants suspended the U.S. president while continuing to provide a megaphone to tyrants like Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Venezuela’s Nicolas Máduro of Venezuela and Cuba’s Miguel Díaz-Canel.<br />Big Tech seems focused on acting as an extension of big government, quashing content from those who oppose their liberal ideology. President Biden has criticized social-media platforms, notably  Facebook ,  for allowing the spread of “misinformation.” Press secretary Jen Psaki said the administration is “in regular touch with social media platforms” to flag “problematic” posts.<br />Twitter  suspended the Conservative Party of New York State’s account for six weeks leading up to November’s election.

Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expect the country’s retail sales to increase 11.4% from a year earlier, compared with a 12.1% gain in June. Industrial output in July likely rose 7.8% on year, decelerating from 8.3% in June. China’s nonrural fixed-asset investment—a measure that captures investment in factories, railroads and new homes—also likely retreated although the government has aimed to boost infrastructure investment.<br />U.S. retail sales are expected to post a small decline in July. Economists are forecasting a drag from weaker auto sales, caused in part by supply-chain issues that have limited dealer inventories. It is less clear if a rise in Covid-19 cases during the month had an appreciable impact on household spending.<br />U.S. industrial production—a measure of output at factories, mines and utilities—is expected to increase in July. Manufacturing, the biggest component of the index, has been caught between strong demand for products and unreliable supplies of materials and labor.<br />U.S. housing starts are forecast to have cooled in July.

      <td>Pundits repeat the mantra that there was ‘no military solution.’ The Taliban seem to have come up with one.</td>
      <td>The world is witnessing in Afghanistan a vivid and painful display of what happens when leaders in Washington delude themselves regarding persistent threats, the nature of America’s enemies and the ability to end wars by simply going home.<br />On April 14, ignoring predictions of dire consequences, President Biden announced that all U.S. forces would depart by Sept. 11—20 years to the day after jihadist terrorists used their safe haven in the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan to launch the deadliest terrorist attack in history.<br />As U.S. forces departed, the Taliban seized the initiative and launched an offensive on Afghan cities, taking control of the large majority of provinces in 11 days. The takeovers in the north exposed the Taliban’s plan, along with al Qaeda, to isolate and overthrow the elected government in Kabul and subjugate the country under its brutal form of Shariah. The fall of Kandahar on Thursday gave the Taliban a major symbolic victory in the ideological center of the antimodernist and misogynist movement. The fall of Ghazni, Laghman, Logar and Paktia provinces on Kabul’s doorstep enabled the disaster we are now seeing in the capital.<br />In areas they conquer, the Taliban conduct mass executions and assassinate journalists and anyone else who might oppose their perverted theocratic dictatorship. The Taliban force women to “marry” terrorists, who rape them, force them to wear the burqa and otherwise strip them of rights they have enjoyed for nearly two decades. Taking stock of this catastrophe and determining what might be done to limit the damage requires a rejection of Washington’s fantasy and an acknowledgment of Afghanistan’s reality.<br />In Washington, U.S. forces supposedly had to leave to end a costly “forever war.” But when Mr. Biden made the decision to withdraw, no more than 3,500 U.S. troops were left in Afghanistan. They were supporting Afghans who were taking the brunt of the fight, and not a single American soldier had been killed in combat in a year and a half.</td>

      <td>Washington may follow Beijing’s crackdown, and CEOs need to act now to slow the regulatory rush.</td>
      <td>Big U.S. tech companies must be watching with glee as China cracks down on its homegrown technology companies. They are thrilled not only because they are seeing potential global competitors in e-commerce, music licensing, ride sharing, food delivery and more weakened, but because they now have a powerful card to play at home.<br />It started last October when Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba and its affiliate Ant Financial, complained at the Shanghai Bund Summit that regulators were too cautious: “There is no innovation in this world without risk.” He also said Chinese banks have a pawnshop mentality, requiring collateral before they lend, unlike Ant, which was about to go public, which uses algorithms to assess creditworthiness. Mr. Ma’s criticisms were correct, but he angered the powers that be. Even though shares for Ant Financial’s initial public offering were 870 times oversubscribed, the Shanghai Stock Exchange effectively canceled the IPO in early November. Alibaba stock is down more than a third since then. Ouch.<br />Never bite the hand that feeds you. Back when Alibaba was private, Mr. Ma benefited when Chinese regulators and the Chinese Central bank forced a spinout of their payment system, Alipay, basically taking away value from existing Alibaba shareholders, like Yahoo and  SoftBank ,  and giving it to Chinese investors. That was a money heist.<br />Killing the Ant IPO likely damaged the company’s ability to raise capital. It was a dumb move given how fickle global markets are about government control. Ever wonder if capitalism and communism/authoritarianism are compatible long term? We are finding out.<br />The purge continues. Food-delivery company Meituan was fined $1 billion for abusing its market position. Ride-sharing leader  Didi Global  was warned to delay its U.S. IPO listing over cybersecurity concerns. It went public anyway, at $14, and then the China State Council announced new rules and a probe of overseas listings. Didi stock is now under $9.</td>

She had said the infrastructure package wouldn’t move ahead until Senate passage of the $3.5 trillion antipoverty and healthcare legislation. Progressives have demanded that the two move on parallel tracks to guarantee their priorities.<br />“I have requested that the Rules Committee explore the possibility of a rule that advances both the budget resolution and the bipartisan infrastructure package. This will put us on a path to advance the infrastructure bill and the reconciliation bill,” Mrs. Pelosi said in a letter Sunday.<br />Passage of such a rule is expected to move the infrastructure bill forward procedurally, but not pass it, according to an aide to Mrs. Pelosi.</td>

      <td>OTTAWA—Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called an early national election for next month, looking to capitalize on popular support for his government’s efforts to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and secure a third term in power.<br />On Sunday, Mr. Trudeau officially requested that Governor General Mary Simon, the representative of Queen Elizabeth, who is Canada’s head of state, dissolve parliament and set national elections for Sept. 20. She granted the request. The next parliamentary elections weren’t due until 2023.<br />“Canadians need to choose how we finish the fight against Covid-19 and build back better, from getting the job done on vaccines to having people’s backs all the way to and through the end of this crisis,” Mr. Trudeau told reporters. “I am asking [Canadians] to vote for real progressive leadership, strong healthcare, for affordable housing, and a clean and protected environment.”<br />Mr. Trudeau has governed Canada for the past two years with only a minority of legislators in parliament, forcing him to get support of one of the left-leaning parties to pass legislation. With the snap vote, he is hoping to secure a parliamentary majority that will allow him to pass a progressive agenda including increased child care, more social spending and investments in clean energy.<br />Moreover, opposition parties control parliamentary committees, which has given them the power to conduct politically damaging inquiries into Mr. Trudeau. They have probed the prime minister’s ties to a youth charity that received government contracts, and the prime minister’s record on dealing with sexual misconduct in the armed forces.</td>

You note the report’s estimate of likely climate-sensitivity range: 2.5 to 4 degrees Celsius higher than in the late 1800s, to be compared with a corresponding range reported in the IPCC’s 2013 report: 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius. You say the top end has been moderated, but I’d add that the bottom end has been shortened. A temperature rise as low as between 1.5 and 2.5 degrees is now in the unlikely range, per the IPCC. That’s very significant. The center of the likely range rises. The new IPCC report is not to be taken lightly.<br />Riley Newman<br />Irvine, Calif.<br /><br />Holman Jenkins makes a great point in “Same Climate Report, Different Day” (Business World, Aug. 11). If progressives really believed climate change is the existential threat they say it is, they would entertain a deal that couples a carbon tax with pro-growth tax relief. This could reduce emissions while providing income-tax relief and avoiding a net tax hike.</td>

Yes, antisemitism is a hatred like so many hatreds, but after combatting it for more than 50 years, I can assure you it is also, sadly, unique (“Anti-Semitism Isn’t Merely Another Kind of Hate,” op-ed, Aug. 9).<br />All the hatreds that Mr. Lapid cites single out specific targets: a group, a conflict, a war, a religion and ideology—and in most instances they are limited in time or geography. Antisemitism, the hatred of Jews, is timeless, universal and multipurpose. It serves many masters, many interests. It has continued to metastasize. It matters not what Jews do or do not, say or not say. Facts and truth are irrelevant, as long as the hatred of Jews serves the interests at hand—political, ideological, religious or commercial.<br />It was in the past when Jews were prohibited from doing things others were permitted to do. Today, it is the state of Israel that has become the Jew among the nations. It alone cannot be allowed to decide its capital or have the right to defend itself. And that is not just a hatred as all others.<br />Abe Foxman<br />Bergen County, N.J.</td>

If the government is planning to take in more money, it is going to be collecting more of your money in taxes. That’s money that could and should be spent by families, in a bill we don’t need and can’t afford. This is just another liberal wish list.<br />Politicians in Washington have never been more disconnected from the American people.

Sixty-four percent of voters and 49% of Democrats support ending deficit spending and requiring a balanced budget, and 60% of voters and 55% of Democrats support environmental and labor deregulation to get infrastructure projects going.<br />It’s not only Republican constituents who want fiscal responsibility and deregulation, it’s Democrats as well.

Chinese GDP fell by 6.7% in the first quarter of 2020 from a year earlier, while the U.S. GDP registered a small gain.<br />China’s aggressive response initially restored the country’s growth to a pace faster than America’s, which faced the economic brunt of the pandemic later and largely eschewed mandatory quarantines.</td>

I have an explanation, but it isn’t perfect.<br />My take: Investors came to the realization that the huge post-pandemic debt burden will keep rates lower than in the past, while they kept faith that inflation will be manageable. There is little to indicate investors fear a recession-inducing mistake by the Federal Reserve, and they aren’t expecting runaway inflation either.<br />The market response from March to the start of this month can be thought of as pricing in a repeat of the secular stagnation brought on by the 2008 financial crisis, with the twist of slightly higher inflation than in the past decade.<br />Pramod Atluri, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Capital Group, says this is akin to “too much debt and too much money in the system.”</td>

Joe Dunford. “It is highly likely the Taliban will march into Kabul, overturn the democratic government we have been supporting for 20 years and seek to punish, if not execute, the Afghans who worked with us.”<br />Mr. Biden has resolutely defended his troop withdrawal decision, saying that Washington had accomplished its mission in the region by killing Osama bin Laden and depriving al Qaeda of its sanctuary in Afghanistan, and had nothing to gain by perpetuating its military deployments in the country.<br />“One more year, or five more years, of U.S. military presence would not have made a difference if the Afghan military cannot or will not hold its own country,” Mr. Biden said in a statement Saturday. “And an endless American presence in the middle of another country’s civil conflict was not acceptable to me.”</td>

The transaction comes six months after Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy, in which it cut about $7 billion in debt.<br />The purchase of Vine Energy would make Chesapeake the largest gas company in the Haynesville Shale, a large gas-producing region in Louisiana and East Texas.

      <td>Before wielding the atomic bomb, the U.S. subdued Japan’s forces across the Pacific with weapons designed by an inventor who died two decades earlier</td>
      <td>From March 1945 until the end of World War II, the skies over Japan witnessed some of the deadliest aerial raids in history. Fleets of B-29 bombers, the four-engine “Superfortress” that represented the pinnacle of American aeronautical achievement, firebombed Tokyo and virtually all of Japan’s major cities. The air campaign culminated in the use of another unique American invention, the atomic bomb, and 76 years ago, on Aug. 14, 1945, Imperial Japan surrendered.<br />The monthslong, war-ending aerial pounding was only possible, however, after Allied troops conquered enemy island strongholds from Guadalcanal to Okinawa and shot down thousands of Japanese planes. Those victories were won with other American inventions. Quite unlike the B-29, and most certainly unlike the atomic bomb, these other weapons were conceived by a single man—born before the Civil War and already deceased by two decades. His name was John Moses Browning.<br />In a life of extraordinary mechanical creativity, Browning created the weapons that armed every American fighter and bomber and equipped every American infantry unit. The nation may have forgotten, but every battle won in World War II was won with Browning firearms.<br />It’s also true that Browning’s inventions, including the modern slide-action pistol, have contributed to appalling suffering from gun violence in the civilian world. That was the sad, ironic duality of Browning’s mechanical creativity: His firearms could save a life or take a life, or do both, in a single instant. Whether right or wrong often depended on where you stood, in front of the barrel or with your finger on the trigger. For Americans in World War II, of course, the moral judgment was easy to make.<br />American fighter planes carrying up to eight of Browning’s 5-foot-long, .50-caliber machine guns wiped out the Japanese air force. In Europe, Browning’s guns in P-51 Mustangs and P-47 Thunderbolts eliminated the German Luftwaffe as an effective fighting force. Even the American strategic bombing campaign depended on the same Browning machine guns, as every B-17 and B-24 bomber bristled with a dozen or more.</td>

Both the U.S. and Afghan government have asked the Taliban not to enter the city for two weeks until a transitional government could be agreed to, he said. “I do not think the Taliban will accept the offer,” he said. He added that negotiations were under way with the Taliban to choose a new head for the transitional government that would be acceptable for all sides.<br />Sporadic gunfire erupted in central Kabul in the late morning as the administration of Mr. Ghani told all employees to go home. Many checkpoints were abandoned as panicked residents clogged the streets. By early afternoon, the Taliban took over Kabul’s main Pul-e-Charkhi prison, freeing thousands of inmates, videos on social media showed.</td>

But the investor optimism that drove that borrowing has collapsed.<br />Stress has been building following a string of debt defaults and growing concern about a few large issuers, including property giant  China Evergrande Group .  Sharp price declines in its bonds and those of a few other large Chinese companies, plus concerns about tighter regulation aimed at reining in speculation and soaring housing prices, have pushed the market over the edge.<br />“There’s a confidence crisis in Chinese high-yield debt,” said Paul Lukaszewski, head of corporate debt for the Asia Pacific region at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Singapore.<br />The average yield of non-investment-grade U.S. dollar bonds from companies in China topped 14% in late July and early August, around 10 percentage points above the average yield of junk bonds issued by American companies, according to ICE BofA Indices.</td>

Its stock has skyrocketed more than 1000% since the depth of the Covid-19-related selloff in March 2020 and is now valued at more than  Ford Motor Co.  at about $63 billion.<br />Part of the attraction to investors: selling cars is only part of what makes Carvana money. In the second quarter, around 36% of the company’s gross profit per unit came from selling loans it made to customers to buy the cars. Retail sales accounted for 39% of gross profit per unit, Carvana’s preferred earnings measure. Other types of income, including from vehicle-servicing contracts, made up the rest.<br />Last quarter, the loan surge helped Carvana earn its first ever quarterly profit.<br />The company had a setback this past week when North Carolina suspended Carvana from selling cars in the Raleigh area until January after determining it failed to deliver titles to the motor vehicle department and sold cars without state inspections. Carvana said it was pleased to reach a solution, following a probe by the state’s Division of Motor Vehicles.</td>

To keep his oxygen levels up, he uses a device made by Royal Philips NV that is now subject to a huge recall by the Dutch healthcare conglomerate. It warned in June that the machines could be sending potentially cancer-causing particles into users’ airways.<br />When Mr. Horton, a 30-year-old paramedic from Glen Allen, Va., called his medical-device supplier for an alternative, he was told none was available. For now, he is continuing to use the Philips machine.<br />“Every night, I feel like I’m having to pick between cancerous inhalants and my oxygen saturation dropping,” he said.<br />He is one of roughly two million people across the U.S. affected by the recall. Philips has said an internal sound-dampening foam could release potentially harmful gases or particles. Philips has promised to repair or replace affected machines, but says it will take around a year to do so.<br />Since the recall was announced, doctors have been inundated with calls from worried patients. Prices for machines made by Philips’ main competitor,  ResMed Inc.,  have shot up and the devices are becoming more difficult to get. Some patients, feeling ping-ponged between Philips, medical-device suppliers, doctors and insurers, are taking matters into their own hands, either by removing the foam themselves or bypassing insurance to buy new or used machines out of pocket.</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—The group that organized some of the biggest marches during Hong Kong’s 2019 protests said it would disband, as the national-security law ensnares wider swaths of the city’s civil society.<br />The Civil Human Rights Front, which served as an umbrella organization for a number of pro-democracy and human-rights groups, said on Sunday that its members had decided unanimously to disband amid unprecedented and severe challenges.<br />In April, the city’s police began an investigation into the group, saying that it had been operating without proper registration for more than a decade. Leaders of the group were jailed for offenses related to 2019 protests and on national-security charges, and many of the member organizations had already said they would withdraw.<br />“The millions of people that have marched with us through the years rang their demands through the city,” the group said. “They’ve shown the world Hong Kong, shone light on darkness, and planted democracy and freedom in the hearts of the people.”<br />Since Beijing imposed the national-security law on the city last year, dozens of pro-democracy politicians and activists have been charged with violating it. Some dissidents have fled Hong Kong. Those who remain have been prevented from carrying out all but the most subtle acts of antigovernment protest by the law and pandemic restrictions against gathering.</td>

      <td>Among other things, more flex time, work-from-anywhere periods, and continuing stipends for home offices</td>
      <td>With the coming of the hybrid workplace, employee benefits are being put under the microscope. And many companies are realizing that the current crop of benefits may not make as much sense as they used to.<br />“A lot of employers are re-evaluating their benefits propositions,‘’ says Lauren Mason, a principal at Mercer, a management-consulting firm. “Employee values have shifted quite significantly because of the stressors of the pandemic and around child care and other concerns, as well as just re-evaluating life circumstances.”<br />For many companies, this means expanding some benefits while making others less of a priority. In a Care.com survey of 500 human-resource executives in the U.S. conducted in December 2020 and January 2021, 66% said they plan to offer more flexibility, with 63% planning to increase child-care benefits and 41% planning to expand senior-care offerings. At the same time, some benefits that were important pre-Covid, including commuter benefits, on-site meals and on-site child care, are becoming less important, the survey found.<br />Here’s a closer look at how companies and HR experts expect benefits to change in a world transformed by the pandemic:<br />One lesson companies learned from the pandemic is that people often work best when they feel they have more control over their hours, tailored to their specific life needs at the moment. It’s best to focus on output, many HR executives say, rather than time spent working.</td>

Mr. Biden also defended his decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, as the Taliban continues to advance in the country.<br />The steps announced by Mr. Biden don’t represent a major course correction in his decision to withdraw American forces from Afghanistan and largely consist of adjustments to moves already under way as he seeks to disengage from America’s longest war.<br />“I was the fourth President to preside over an American troop presence in Afghanistan—two Republicans, two Democrats. I would not, and will not, pass this war onto a fifth,” he said in a statement.<br />The 5,000 troops include the 3,000 U.S. infantry troops, including one Army and two Marine Corps units, that were announced last week, as well as another 1,000 troops already stationed on the ground. Mr. Biden’s announcement Saturday effectively means there will be an additional 1,000 troops sent from the Gulf region into Kabul due to the worsening security situation there.</td>

      <td>A dispute between  General Motors Co.  and  Ford  Motor Co. over the name of their hands-free driving offerings has escalated into an unusual legal spat between corporate arch rivals.<br />Last month, GM sued Ford over the name of Ford’s assisted-driving system, BlueCruise, which is scheduled to be released later this year. GM said the name is “confusingly similar” to GM’s own system, Super Cruise, as well as that of its driverless-car division, San Francisco-based Cruise. In the lawsuit, GM called its competitor’s naming choice “a brazen attempt to trade on their goodwill.”<br />Ford late Friday filed a legal motion hitting back. The Dearborn, Mich.-based auto maker said it chose the name BlueCruise with a nod to the term cruise control, a generic driving feature that has been offered by auto makers for decades. Ford asked the U.S. District Court in San Francisco to toss out GM’s suit.<br />“Consumers understand ‘cruise’ to refer to a feature in their vehicle that performs part of the driving task or assists them in driving,” it said. “They do not associate that term with any one company or brand.”<br />Ford also petitioned the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to cancel GM’s trademark of the Super Cruise name. In a statement, Ford cited several other uses of the word “cruise” in descriptions of features marketed by other auto companies, including “Smart Cruise Control” from  Hyundai Motor Co.  and “Predictive Cruise” from Mack Trucks Inc.</td>

The statement said that authorities had taken “criminal coercive measures” toward the two men, which under Chinese law could include bail, detention or arrest, among other actions.<br />In the official account on Saturday, the woman, named by police only as Ms. Zhou, attended a celebratory work dinner in late July, during which beer and liquor were consumed.

During his second visit, Mr. Wang forced himself upon her, then ordered condoms to be delivered to the hotel front desk, according to the police.<br />The next morning, Mr. Zhang visited Ms. Zhou’s room, bringing condoms from home, also forcing himself on her, then taking away her underwear, police said.</td>

Kacsmaryk of the Northern District of Texas said the elimination of the policy was arbitrary and violated federal law because the administration didn’t properly consider the benefits of the program. He also wrote that ending it has contributed to the current border surge.<br />“Since [its] termination, the number of enforcement encounters on the southwest border has skyrocketed,” he wrote.<br />The judge, who was appointed by Mr. Trump in 2019, ordered the Biden administration to restart the program but stayed his decision for seven days to allow the government to appeal.</td>

They make Lukashenko more angry and push Belarus much more toward Russia.”<br />Mr. Protasevich, 26, was one of the leading players behind mass protests that followed last year’s presidential election. From his base in Poland, the NEXTA opposition channel he ran on Telegram became one of Belarus’s most widely viewed information sources on the upheaval. Belarusian authorities put him and other NEXTA journalists on a list of people involved in what they described as terrorist activities.<br />His disavowal of the opposition movement comes as a further psychological blow for its leaders, many of whom have fled Belarus to seek safety in neighboring countries including Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine. Thousands of demonstrators, meanwhile, have been arrested since a wave of protests followed Mr. Lukashenko’s claims that he won last August’s elections. Minsk-based human rights group Viasna says over 600 were still being held as of July.</td>

      <td>The very best cooks are the ones who feel confident enough to stop watching the clock and use their senses.</td>
      <td>The late food writer Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor used to say that she could tell when fried chicken was done simply by listening to it. She could gauge exactly the moment that the chicken was crispy and golden from the particular sizzling sound it made in the oil. Sometimes, she once told an interviewer, people would say, “tell me something real, like, what is it? 15 minutes, 20 minutes, or whatever. And I say, you’ve got to listen to the sound of the grease. Listen to the music.”<br />When learning to cook, many of us put our faith in specific timings as the best means to get reliable and precise results. We learn to boil pasta for exactly 10 minutes and to roast chicken for 20 minutes per pound. But the more meals I cook, the more I see that timing is far less solid and reliable than it seems. After 10 minutes, pasta may be perfectly al dente or it may be overboiled. It depends on the brand, and the only way to know for sure is to fish a piece out of the water and taste it. If you trust the clock more than you trust yourself, you will often end up with a disappointing dinner. The very best cooks are the ones—like Vertamae Smart-Grosvenor—who feel confident enough to throw the kitchen timer away.<br />The timings in a recipe can never be the final word, not least because the recipe’s author has no idea what it is like to cook in your kitchen with your particular stove and pans. In her excellent debut cookbook, “Cook This Book: Techniques that Teach and Recipes to Repeat,” recipe developer Molly Baz proposes that because stoves and ovens can vary so widely in size and power, we should regard timings as guidelines rather than fixed dogma. The example Baz gives is steak: “If a recipe says ‘sear the steak until deeply golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes,’ and after 5 minutes has passed your steak is only lightly golden, continue to sear it until it reaches that visual indicator, and no less.”<br />Cooking by the clock can let you down if you stick to it too rigidly. I’ve been making crepes for so many years now, I thought my formula couldn’t fail me. Thirty seconds on the first side, then flip and give it 10 seconds more. At home, these timings give me perfect lacy-brown crepes every time, assuming I have started with a pan hot enough to make the butter sizzle.<br />But this summer, while staying with relatives, I made crepes in an unfamiliar kitchen with an unfamiliar stove and pan and suddenly, my timings were useless. After 30 seconds, the first crepe was raw and pale. Two minutes later, it was still flabby around the edges. In all, it took 3-and-a-half minutes to brown on the first side and a minute on the second side. If I’d trusted the kitchen timer, there would have been no breakfast that day.</td>

Many employees, working at home, became more efficient, productive and happier; others struggled and desperately missed office life.<br />Now, as returning to the office becomes more feasible, the temptation for many managers is to consider the past year and a half as an aberration—a period that’s best left behind and forgotten. Or they will take some of the emergency pandemic practices and consider them a permanent fixture of the workplace.<br />Bosses do both of those at their peril. If managers ignore some of the lessons remote work has taught us, empty offices may remain the norm—but this time it will be because resentful employees have moved on to other companies that better serve their new needs.<br />Whether dealing with employees who are working in the office, remotely or on a hybrid schedule, here are some of the key mistakes that managers should avoid with returning employees.<br />During the pandemic we learned that management practices of 2019 that centered on control are as antiquated as those from a century earlier when factory bosses sat in glass offices watching workers make widgets.</td>

Though some of that volume might include institutional buying—Coinbase, for example, has in general seen strong growth in volume from institutional clients—“in all likelihood most of the exchange spot volume is retail,” said Nate Maddrey, a senior research analyst at Coin Metrics.<br />Beyond trading volume, other signs of activity abound from retail, or nonprofessional, investors. Many so-called altcoins, or alternatives to bitcoin, have seen their prices surge recently—a sign that retail investors are active as they search for digital assets with small market capitalizations and potential for big gains. Cardano, for example, has surged roughly 63% over the course of the last month, according to Friday afternoon figures from CoinDesk, while litecoin has risen about 38% over the same period.</td>

When one sent his son to the hospital, Mr. Perkin noticed how frequently doctors sanitized their hands.<br />His family was sent home with a powerful skin cleanser that was effective—but unpleasant. “The idea just hit me: Why is there no premium product hand sanitizer in the marketplace for consumers?” he said.<br />Inspired by this experience, Mr. Perkin helped launch a hand-sanitizer business in 2015 that became known as Olika. It began selling sanitizer in 2017; and, this week, publicly traded biotechnology company  Amyris Inc.  closed on an agreement to buy the company. Mr. Perkin said he and his family invested more than half a million dollars and received a return of more than 10 times their investment in the Amyris purchase.<br />On the largest scale, there are pandemic winners such as vaccine-maker  Moderna Inc.  The company hadn’t yet developed an approved drug two years ago. But there are also smaller beneficiaries in the medical business and industries alongside it. It is hard to say what those companies’ futures would have held if the pandemic had never come along.</td>

All it will take to level the playing field is a few billion dollars in subsidies.<br />Computer chips have become the 21st century equivalent of oil—a resource so critical to national security and economic growth that no country wants to become dependent on a foreign supplier, especially for the U.S. and Europe if that supplier is China. The chip shortage, which has hampered production of cars and appliances over recent months, has amplified those concerns.<br />The timing of the shortage could be fortuitous for Mr. Gelsinger, who was hired this year to turn around a company that had lost its technological edge, leading to missteps in making its newest semiconductors. With the chip drought, governments are motivated to spend like never before to avoid a repeat. For Intel, the money could fast-track Mr. Gelsinger’s turnaround plan.</td>

      <td>Classrooms that have reopened for the fall are seeing a growing number of Covid-19 outbreaks just days into the semester, causing some schools to temporarily shut down buildings or send students home to quarantine.<br />The outbreaks are among the first indications of how the virus is affecting schools, and come as the country pushes toward—and hopes for—a full return to in-person learning. The rough start has led some school administrators to change course and even consider how to add a virtual learning option.<br />The 3,424 students at Pearl River County District in Mississippi will revert to virtual learning on Monday, just a week after the first day of school, because the number of positive cases among students and teachers doubled within a four-day period, said superintendent Alan Lumpkin.<br />Seventeen teachers and 101 students tested positive for the virus on Thursday, up from 10 and 45 on Monday, respectively. The velocity at which the number of positive cases rose compelled the district’s decision to shut campuses for two weeks.<br />“We never saw that quick spread within a week,” said Mr. Lumpkin. The district was open for in-person learning all last year and managed to avoid any shutdowns, which made the campus closures so soon into this school year all the more surprising. The district will reinstate a mask mandate indoors when students return. It had required students to wear masks last year, in compliance with a statewide order that expired at the end of the school year.</td>

      <td>It’s not too late to prevent a bloodbath and total Taliban victory.</td>
      <td>What an awful, tragic irony. President Biden in April chose Sept. 11 as the deadline for U.S. troops to withdraw from Afghanistan. Now it’s possible that, on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, the Taliban that once protected Osama bin Laden and that the U.S. ousted from power could again rule in Kabul.<br />Mr. Biden would like to absolve himself of responsibility for this looming defeat, but he cannot. He could have withdrawn U.S. forces in a careful way based on conditions and a plan to shore up Afghan forces or midwife an alliance between regional tribal warlords and the government in Kabul. The President did none of that.<br />Instead his mid-April decision to withdraw, on the eve of the summer fighting season, triggered the May 1 start of the Taliban offensive. The rapid withdrawal timetable meant U.S. forces would be preoccupied with that task rather than assisting Afghan forces. His decision to abandon multiple military bases, and withdraw all air power, has denied the Afghan army crucial support it relied on.<br />We are now watching the consequences, as the Taliban captures city after city. Soon the group could control or contest more than 90% of the country, including traditional anti-Taliban strongholds in the north. Insurgents have seized Kandahar and Herat—the second and third largest cities—and an assault on Kabul could come soon. The U.S. is evacuating all but a bare-bones diplomatic staff and may even move them from the U.S. Embassy.<br />Even now, however, it’s not too late to stop or slow the slaughter. Outside of well-regarded special forces units, Afghan army troops have retreated willy-nilly as they’ve lost confidence in holding off the Taliban. But allied air power and maintenance assistance were a basic part of Kabul’s defense strategy.</td>

      <td>The Justices block a New York ban, as the CDC gets a reprieve.</td>
      <td>The Supreme Court on Thursday partially blocked New York’s state eviction ban, and given how politicians have abused the law amid the pandemic, it’s good to see the judiciary push back. Next up is President Biden’s nationwide eviction moratorium, which received a reprieve Friday in a lower court, but the Justices may get another look at that soon.<br />New York’s law allowed tenants to halt eviction proceedings merely by attesting that they faced financial hardship due to Covid-19. Landlords couldn’t get a hearing or challenge tenant claims. “This scheme,” the Supreme Court said in an unsigned order, “violates the Court’s longstanding teaching that ordinarily ‘no man can be a judge in his own case’ consistent with the Due Process Clause.”<br />The initial effects will be somewhat limited. Tenants can still raise a Covid hardship defense under New York law. Mr. Biden’s national eviction ban, issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, covers most of the state. But as of Friday, seven counties were excluded. Evictions may also proceed on tenants earning above $99,000 (or $198,000 for couples), who aren’t shielded by the CDC order. New York will begin to tiptoe toward housing normality.<br />Justice Stephen Breyer dissented, joined by the Court’s other two liberals. He argues that the Supreme Court should grant New York judicial latitude, given the health and economic uncertainties posed by Covid. Where’s the limiting principle? Landlords still have property rights in a pandemic, and they ought to have due process, too.<br />Justice Breyer also leans on the argument that New York’s eviction ban is set to expire Aug. 31, and the state “is currently distributing more than $2 billion in aid.” That was Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s argument in June for leaving the CDC’s national eviction ban in place—before Mr. Biden extended it anyway. It’s encouraging that six Justices didn’t fall for it this time.</td>

      <td>Drug prices are falling, but the President needs a foil for inflation.</td>
      <td>President Biden is worried inflation is undermining public support for his agenda so he’s rounding up the usual villains. On Thursday he lambasted drug makers for “jacking up prices.” These are the companies that have produced the vaccines and treatments that are saving the world from Covid-19.<br />“Right now, right here in America, we pay the highest prescription drug costs of any developed nation in the world,” Mr. Biden said in touting his plan for drug price controls. He’s right, but Americans also get access to more and better treatments sooner—as with the Covid vaccines.<br />Profits from successful drugs finance research and development into new treatments and many failures that lead to future discoveries.  Pfizer ’s  profits from blockbuster drugs like Viagra have allowed it to invest in its mRNA research that became the platform for its vaccine, new first-line treatment for non-small lung cancer, and novel oral treatment for advanced prostate cancer.<br />Meanwhile, drug prices have been falling due to increased competition. Prescription drug prices have declined 2.6% over the past year while the consumer-price index rose 5.4%. Here’s something else Mr. Biden got wrong: Medicare already negotiates over prescription drug prices, which is the reason some consumers aren’t seeing the price cuts.<br />Private insurers that manage Medicare Part D plans demand rebates from drug makers to place their drugs on formularies. The insurers then use the rebates to reduce premiums for all beneficiaries. As a result, drug makers raise their list prices, so some beneficiaries with higher deductibles and coinsurance pay more out of pocket for some drugs.</td>

      <td>A top official recognizes America’s relative decline in the Pacific.</td>
      <td>The drumbeat of concern from America’s most important Asian ally about China’s military rise is getting louder. Last month Japan’s Deputy Prime Minister Taro Asowarned that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan could threaten Japan’s “survival.” Now Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi has bluntly acknowledged America’s relative decline in the Western Pacific and the need for Japan to assert itself militarily to fill the void.<br />The remarks came in an interview with Australia’s Sydney Morning Herald. Mr. Kishi “said the shifting power balance between the US and China ‘has become very conspicuous’ while a military battle over Taiwan had ‘skewed greatly in favour of China,’” the paper reports. He added that China “is trying to change the status quo unilaterally backed by force and coercion” and said “we must build a structure where we can protect ourselves.”<br />Japanese officials are normally soft-spoken in public, but China’s immense military buildup has become impossible to ignore. According to a new Lowy Institute report by military analyst Thomas Shugart, China has “become the world’s premier sea power by most measures,” adding 80 warships to its navy in the last five years while the U.S. added 36.<br />Measured by warship tonnage, China’s naval expansion since 2016 easily outpaced the expansion of the U.S. Pacific fleet and the allied “Quad” navies of India, Japan and Australia combined, the report finds. The U.S. Navy retains some qualitative advantages, but quantity eventually overwhelms quality.<br />Japan, which mostly relies on the U.S. for its defense, has a front-row seat to this realignment in sea power. Meanwhile, the Biden Administration has proposed an inflation-adjusted cut to America’s defense budget. The Senate Armed Services Committee added $25 billion last month, but with Congress preparing a $3.5 trillion welfare-state expansion, observers in Tokyo have good reason to doubt the U.S. can ever afford to underwrite Pacific security in the way it has since World War II.</td>

Democrats, meanwhile, have largely avoided casting blame at the White House after supporting the idea of the withdrawal.<br />Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), who has warned that Afghanistan could be “an even worse sequel” to the 1975 fall of Saigon, said he had an “urgent conversation” Friday with Afghanistan’s ambassador to the U.S., Adela Raz.<br />“This debacle was not only foreseeable, it was foreseen,” Mr. McConnell said in a statement. “The President and his team actively decided against a far more responsible approach to preserving our national security interests and protecting our Afghan partners.”<br />He said it isn’t too late to prevent the Taliban from overrunning Kabul. “The Administration should move quickly to hammer Taliban advances with air strikes, provide critical support to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) defending the capital, and prevent the seemingly imminent fall of the city,” Mr. McConnell said.<br />“If they fail to do so, the security threat to the United States will assuredly grow and the humanitarian cost to innocent Afghans will be catastrophic,” he added.</td>

All that remains outstanding are $33 million of tether tokens, frozen by the company Tether in the effort to recover the stolen goods.<br />Poly Network is still waiting for the hacker to provide access, known as the final key, to the wallet containing the returned crypto, the company said.<br />The incident highlights the risks of trading in crypto markets. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler said recently that the area is rife with “fraud, scams and abuse” and in need of investor protections and regulation.<br />“When I look at DeFi projects, this stuff is not tried-and-true-tested,” said Halsey Huth, head of growth at MoonPay, a cryptocurrencies payments platform, referring to companies that provide financial services using blockchain technology. “Everyone interacting with this stuff knows there’s always a chance there’s going to be a bug or an exploit.”</td>

      <td>The New York state Assembly said it would suspend its impeachment investigation of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, days after the three-term governor said he would resign.<br />Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, a Democrat, said Friday that the investigation’s purpose was to determine whether Mr. Cuomo should remain in office.<br />“The governor’s resignation answers that directive,” Mr. Heastie said, adding that the state’s constitution doesn’t allow the legislature to impeach and remove an elected official who is no longer in office. An impeachment trial could have led to a finding that barred Mr. Cuomo from holding statewide office in the future.<br />The Assembly had been looking into sexual-harassment allegations against Mr. Cuomo as well as alleged misuse of state resources in publishing a pandemic memoir and the misleading disclosure of Covid-19 nursing home data.<br />“This evidence, we believe, could likely have resulted in articles of impeachment had he not resigned,” said Mr. Heastie.</td>

      <td>U.S. trade judge’s findings on some of the tech giant’s phone and speaker products could lead to import ban</td>
      <td>Sonos Inc.  netted a legal victory in a patent dispute with Google, as a U.S. trade judge ruled Friday that some Pixel smartphones and Nest audio speakers infringe on Sonos’s technology and could be barred from import.<br />Judge Charles Bullock of the U.S. International Trade Commission found that Google has infringed on five patents related to synchronizing audio, adjusting volume and connecting to Wi-Fi. The judge’s full ruling is expected in coming days.<br />The initial decision should help Sonos as it presses  Alphabet Inc.  subsidiary Google to strike a royalty agreement for a portfolio of patents. Amid rising competition from  Amazon.com Inc.,   Apple Inc.  and others, the speaker maker has looked to supplement hardware sales by licensing its portfolio of patents to other tech companies. Analysts estimate such an agreement could be worth as much as $50 million annually. Sonos reported $1.34 billion in its latest fiscal year ended Oct. 3.<br />The patent dispute is playing out as regulatory pressure rises for tech giants, including Google, Apple and Amazon, which lawmakers and regulators alike have accused of using their platforms to curtail competition. Sonos has helped lead an attack against those larger players, testifying before the Senate that they subsidize products to gain market share and collect data to further their dominance.<br />“This decision re-affirms the strength and breadth of our portfolio, marking a promising milestone in our long-term pursuit to defend our innovation against misappropriation by Big Tech monopolies,” said Eddie Lazarus, Sonos’ chief legal officer.</td>

Virgin Galactic Holdings and satellite-launch company Virgin Orbit have been bright spots.<br />Last month, Mr. Branson beat fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos into space in a high-profile trip that took him on a Virgin Galactic Holdings spacecraft more than 50 miles above Earth.

      <td>Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman bring sparks to Alfred Hitchcock’s ‘Notorious,’ a film that weaves together morals and emotions.</td>
      <td>Seventy-five years after its premiere in theaters, Alfred Hitchcock’s “Notorious” remains a masterpiece of manipulation. Its rather sordid story of a credulous woman used by the FBI to outwit Nazis living undercover in Brazil is enrobed in elegance and emotional tension, to the point that the audience cannot help but sympathize with both the lovers and the “villain” they seek to unmask.<br />The ninth film made by the British director in Hollywood, “Notorious” took two years to create. Late in 1944, while World War II was still raging, Hitchcock and the veteran screenwriter Ben Hecht conceived a Nazi plot to use uranium-235 for a weapon that would somehow restore the power of the Third Reich. This was almost a full year before atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the Americans.<br />David O. Selznick, to whom Hitchcock was contracted, found the story implausible, and sold “Notorious” to RKO Radio Pictures as a package for $800,000 (close to $12 million today). When François Truffaut told the master, “This is truly my favorite Hitchcock picture,” Hitchcock responded with the comment that “Notorious” had cost RKO some $2 million and had grossed $8 million—a profit of some $84 million in 2021.<br />The film’s dramatic theme was no guarantee of success, however. Orson Welles’s “The Stranger,” which opened just one month prior to “Notorious,” also dealt with Nazis on the run but failed to please either critics or audiences. The brilliance of “Notorious” stems from its casting of Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant and the underestimated Claude Rains, allied to Hitchcock’s meticulous control of dialogue, image and music. Hecht had first worked with Hitchcock on “Foreign Correspondent” and was renowned for his speed in concocting or even rescuing a screenplay. The verbal exchanges in “Notorious” exemplify Hecht’s skill in suggesting profound feelings under cover of everyday conversation (Grant’s laconic “I’ve always been scared of women, but I’ll get over it”).<br />The debonair yet somber Devlin (Grant) finds himself more than just beguiled by the fresh-faced candor of Bergman’s Alicia Huberman, whose father has been imprisoned for fomenting a Nazi revival in Florida. Devlin obeys his FBI superiors by persuading Alicia, a reluctant Mata Hari, to get involved with a Nazi fugitive, now posing as Alex Sebastian (Rains) in Rio de Janeiro.</td>

      <td>Xi Jinping, the ruler of China, suffers from several internal inconsistencies which greatly reduce the cohesion and effectiveness of his leadership. There is a conflict between his beliefs and his actions and between his public declarations of wanting to make China a superpower and his behavior as a domestic ruler. These internal contradictions have revealed themselves in the context of the growing conflict between the U.S. and China.<br />At the heart of this conflict is the reality that the two nations represent systems of governance that are diametrically opposed. The U.S. stands for a democratic, open society in which the role of the government is to protect the freedom of the individual. Mr. Xi believes Mao Zedong invented a superior form of organization, which he is carrying on: a totalitarian closed society in which the individual is subordinated to the one-party state. It is superior, in this view, because it is more disciplined, stronger and therefore bound to prevail in a contest.<br />Relations between China and the U.S. are rapidly deteriorating and may lead to war. Mr. Xi has made clear that he intends to take possession of Taiwan within the next decade, and he is increasing China’s military capacity accordingly.<br />He also faces an important domestic hurdle in 2022, when he intends to break the established system of succession to remain president for life. He feels that he needs at least another decade to concentrate the power of the one-party state and its military in his own hands. He knows that his plan has many enemies, and he wants to make sure they won’t have the ability to resist him.<br />It is against this background that the current turmoil in the financial markets is unfolding, catching many people unaware and leaving them confused. The confusion has compounded the turmoil.</td>

      <td>His price controls led to an exponential increase in demand, which caused a shock when they ended.</td>
      <td>President Richard Nixon announced a 90-day freeze on all prices and wages in the U.S. on Aug. 15, 1971. Suddenly and with no warning, every shop and factory was forbidden to raise prices for every product sold anywhere in the country. It was a watershed moment—a radical program that imposed direct government control over the economy aimed at breaking the cycle of inflationary price and wage hikes.<br />A half-century later, the policy seems almost otherworldly. Does anyone think factory owners and shopkeepers would accept a peremptory presidential directive to freeze prices today? Resistance to government action has become deeply ingrained. In the face of the pandemic, Americans routinely flout governmental decrees to wear face masks and maintain social distance. Opposition to a freeze directive would almost certainly be swift and overwhelming.<br />Yet 50 years ago, retailers and employers, small and large, accepted Nixon’s order. Consumers, whose purchasing power had been eroded by years of rising prices, felt as if they’d caught a break; government had stepped in and forced greedy merchants to stop gouging them, at least for a while. What was not to like?<br />A Democratic Congress had passed the Economic Stabilization Act in 1970, with language authorizing the president to impose price controls to fight inflation. Nixon signed the law, but Democrats were confident that a Republican president would never freeze prices. They planned to use his failure to do so as a political cudgel in the 1972 campaign. Nixon’s surprise announcement turned the tables.<br />It worked—for a while. The freeze persuaded organized labor to temper wage demands and broke what had been an inflationary spiral of price and wage hikes that sapped consumer buying power. But Phase II of Nixon’s program imposed increasingly complex rules that became both unpopular and a political burden. After the initial burst of popularity—which lasted long enough to boost Nixon’s landslide re-election in 1972—the program failed spectacularly and ushered in nearly a decade of so-called stagflation—high inflation coupled with slow growth, which reduced living standards for millions of Americans.</td>

      <td>A classic capitalist enterprise attacks capitalism.</td>
      <td>This has been the year of woke and weak corporate CEOs trying to signal virtue by endorsing leftist politics and attacking Republicans. But now we have a bizarre case of a business attacking itself. The Manhattan Institute’s Christopher Rufo writes this week in the New York Post about a lecture hosted by  American Express .  He reports that at the Amex corporate event a guest speaker argued that the system of capitalism was founded on racism and that “racist logics and forms of domination” have shaped Western society from the Industrial Revolution to the present. Mr. Rufo quotes the insufferable lecturer telling Amex employees, “You are complicit in giving privileges in one community against the other, under the pretext that we live in a meritocratic system where the market judges everyone the same.”<br />Well, it’s true that the company’s advertisements have touted the privileges enjoyed by consumers who use its ubiquitous green cards. But the history of American Express is the story of a company that has thrived by offering its many services to a broader and broader clientele. The firm’s website says it has more than 100 million cards in use—accepted by millions of merchants. Sure, it has generally served a higher-income segment than Visa and Mastercard, but there are options for all kinds of consumers.<br />Mr. Rufo describes how American Express employees had to define themselves:<br />American Express would seem to be a particularly difficult choice if one is seeking to prove a case of systemic racism. Paul Beckett reported in the Journal in 1999:<br />Mr. Chenault would go on to enjoy a long tenure in the top job as capitalists bid up the price of American Express shares.

      <td>The Swedish filmmaker’s most recent work, ‘About Endlessness,’ pays tribute to artists like Marc Chagall and Edward Hopper.</td>
      <td>The Swedish filmmaker Roy Andersson, 78, often refers to his intricately designed movies as “three-dimensional paintings.” He tends to find his visual inspirations in the work of master painters as opposed to other filmmakers. “I don’t think that many other directors work with art history in the way that I do,” Mr. Andersson says.<br />His most recent film, “About Endlessness,” was released in the U.S. this year after winning a Silver Lion for best director at the Venice Film Festival in 2019. The film, which took about five years to make, knits together 40 vignettes about human vulnerability; they are, by turns, comic, satirical, tragic and deeply personal. In one silent scene, a father ties his daughter’s shoelace while grappling with an umbrella in the teeth of a howling gale; in another, an alcoholic priest suffering a crisis of faith stumbles through a communion service.<br />In “About Endlessness,” Mr. Andersson uses specially built studio sets, with extensive modeling and trompe-l’oeil effects, to evoke the themes and imagery of some of his favorite painters, including Otto Dix, Edward Hopper and Pieter Bruegel the Elder. A recurring visual motif in the film is an entwined couple floating over the bombed-out ruins of World War II-era Cologne. Mr. Andersson based the image on Marc Chagall’s ethereal painting “Over the Town” (1918), which depicts the artist and his wife flying over the artist’s hometown of Vitebsk, in Belarus, where he grew up.<br />Mr. Andersson said he reconstituted the Chagall image as a way of expressing his abiding sadness over the memory of World War II, “a time of shame in history.” Born in Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1943, he grew up in a working-class family where the war wasa constant topic of conversation. Though Sweden was neutral in the conflict, Mr. Andersson’s father served in the military as a border guard.<br />Mr. Andersson’s creative and personal struggles in making “About Endlessness” are brought into focus in a new documentary by British director Fred Scott, “Being a Human Person,” released in the U.S. last month. In the film, Mr. Andersson talks openly about his lack of self-confidence and his reliance on alcohol to raise his spirits in the face of adversity. His first feature, “A Swedish Love Story” (1970), was a critical and commercial success in Sweden and abroad, but after his second film flopped in 1975 he retreated from making features altogether. For the next quarter-century he focused on establishing Studio 24, an independent film company in Stockholm, and making hundreds of commercials and several short films.</td>

      <td>Federal judge says any stop to Biden’s moratorium must come from higher court</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—A federal judge on Friday allowed the Biden administration’s new eviction moratorium to remain in place, saying she didn’t have authority to block it despite her misgivings about the ban’s legality.<br />U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich in Washington said she was bound by a previous ruling from the appeals court above her that said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention likely possessed the authority to impose an eviction ban in the name of public health.<br />Judge Friedrich in May ruled the previous version of the moratorium was unlawful because it exceeded the CDC’s powers, but that ruling never went into effect while litigation continued. In her Friday decision, she suggested the new ban suffered from the same legal problems. “But the court’s hands are tied,” she wrote in a 13-page opinion.<br />If there is to be a judicial order blocking the latest eviction ban, it will have to come from a higher court, the judge, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, said.<br />The moratorium has protected millions of tenants during the Covid-19 pandemic but created financial hardships for some landlords unable to collect rental income they rely upon for their own livelihoods.</td>

      <td>Biden’s alternative empowers the government to confiscate and redistribute.</td>
      <td>Jason L. Riley’s op-ed “Biden Is Delivering Obama’s Third Term” (Aug. 10) contends that allowing working parents to keep more of their hard-earned money is “wealth redistribution—in the form of some kind of basic income guaranteed by the government.”<br />The argument makes no sense. The alternative to a tax code that lets working parents keep more of their money is a tax code that empowers the government to confiscate and redistribute more of that hard-earned money.<br />At issue is the misrepresentation of my proposal to expand the child tax credit for working parents. In 2017, despite opposition from many in my party and the Journal’s editorial page, I worked with Sen. Mike Lee and Ivanka Trump to double the credit as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. By some estimates, the changes helped the average family of four keep an extra $2,900 a year of their own money.<br />That’s not redistribution; it is common sense. Thankfully, Senate Republicans agree with me, voting unanimously in March to expand the credit beyond the TCJA levels, up to $3,300 a child, including $4,200 for children under 6. But it is a credit against taxes paid, which means work is required.<br />By contrast, the Biden administration’s new child allowance is wealth redistribution and the first step toward a universal basic income, because it includes no work requirement. For example, over the next six months, some American households with no working adults will receive more than $6,000 in cash payments from the federal government.</td>

      <td>Instability threatens the government in Islamabad and Beijing’s economic program in Central Asia.</td>
      <td>The Taliban are taking over city after city in Afghanistan at a stunning speed. But as the U.S. found in 2001, it’s one thing to topple a regime, another to set up a stable new one. Even if the Taliban can negotiate a formal return to power, the country will remain chaotic for a long time, with serious implications for the region, especially for Pakistan and China—in different but geopolitically significant ways.<br />The impact will be most immediate for Pakistan, which is already feeling it. In the past two decades the Taliban have gone from being a proxy of Islamabad to a threat. When Washington toppled the Taliban in late 2001, Pakistan saw it as a major foreign-policy loss even though it cooperated with the U.S. Islamabad continued to view the Afghan jihadist movement as an ally even in 2007-14, when it faced a major insurgency on its own soil from the Pakistani Taliban rebels. For more than a decade the “good vs. bad Taliban” narrative dominated the national conversation, distinguishing between those who fought in Afghanistan and those who sought to topple the Pakistani state.<br />It wasn’t until early last month that the country’s top two generals—the army chief and the head of Inter-Services Intelligence—acknowledged, in a rare briefing to opposition members of Parliament, that the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban were “two faces of the same coin.” These remarks underscore that the Pakistani elite now fears its erstwhile proxies because their own country has been deeply penetrated by the Taliban ideology.<br />The Taliban comeback in Afghanistan will galvanize many Islamist actors in Pakistan to emulate the Afghan jihadist movement. It will be a huge challenge for a terribly weakened Islamic Republic of Pakistan to sustain itself with an Islamic emirate next door. Only a few years ago, and at great cost in blood and treasure, was Islamabad able to take back large swathes of its territory near the Afghan border from Taliban rebels. Those gains are at risk of being lost again.<br />Since the end of major military operations against Taliban insurgents in 2015, Pakistan has been increasingly dependent on China for its economic recovery. The biggest project of China’s Belt and Road Initiative is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, in which Beijing has invested tens of billions of dollars. The fate of CPEC has increasingly come into question, especially in recent weeks with growing attacks, likely by Pakistani Taliban, targeting Chinese workers in the country. From Beijing’s point of view, a spillover of insecurity from Afghanistan will undermine its investments in Pakistan.</td>

      <td>The government set out to help small businesses but left landlords at the mercy of abusive tenants.</td>
      <td>The U.S. Supreme Court’s Thursday injunction against New York state’s eviction moratorium didn’t come too soon for Rosanna Morey. She is dying of blood cancer, and her worst enemy lives downstairs.<br />Ms. Morey, 48, lives with her teenage son in Seaford, N.Y., in a high ranch house she bought in 2013, about five years after she was diagnosed with a rare, incurable and unpredictable cancer. Ms. Morey undergoes chemotherapy, and last year her sister offered to move into the ground-floor apartment to help care for her. In June 2020, Ms. Morey told her tenant, Lorrie Santucci, that she wouldn’t renew the lease. Ms. Santucci, who has lived there for about three years, refused to leave. According to Ms. Morey, Ms. Santucci hasn’t paid rent since November.<br />New York state’s Covid-19 Emergency Eviction and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2020 permits tenants to declare hardship because of the pandemic and prohibits landlords from evicting them or even challenging their claim in court. By a 6-3 vote, the justices held that the scheme violates the “longstanding teaching that ordinarily ‘no man can be a judge in his own case’ consistent with the Due Process Clause.”<br />Under a nationwide moratorium issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, landlords can face fines or jail time for evicting tenants who fall below an income threshold and cite Covid hardship for their failure to pay rent. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in June that the CDC had “exceeded its existing statutory authority” with the moratorium, but he joined four colleagues to let the ban stand until it expired “in only a few weeks.” The CDC extended the moratorium anyway, and on Friday a federal district judge declined to block it. The justices are likely to revisit the question.<br />Covid relief measures like the Paycheck Protection Program were designed to help the vulnerable while dispersing the cost among current and future taxpayers. The eviction moratoriums are different: They impose severe hardships on certain people in the name of helping others. The toll is especially high on small landlords like Ms. Morey, who must pay for insurance, mortgages, property taxes and upkeep regardless of whether they’re receiving rent payments. Ms. Morey says Ms. Santucci owes her almost $16,000.</td>

      <td>BEFORE MICHAEL KORS decided to pursue a career in fashion, he wanted to be an actor. “I took lessons in acting, and I quickly realized that I was never going to be anything on the stage,” Mr. Kors said in an interview from his Midtown Manhattan office. If his theatrical career fizzled, he figured he’d end up waiting tables—not an ideal prospect. “I knew I’d be the worst waiter in the world.”<br />Instead, he turned to fashion—something that had interested him since childhood—studying at New York’s Fashion Institute of Technology. If a fashion career didn’t pan out, “I knew I could always work in retail, and I’m a confirmed shopaholic. That seemed like nirvana for me,” Mr. Kors said.<br />He didn’t need to work in retail. This year, the American designer—who helmed the French fashion house Celine from 1997 to 2004 and later exercised his theatrical chops as an unfiltered judge on “Project Runway”—celebrates his eponymous label’s 40th anniversary. “I think the best things take time,” he said.<br />Known for lush basics and simple elegance, his collections often bring that stepping-off-a-private-jet look to everyday life. “We’re social animals,” he said, explaining his aesthetic. “We want to see other people strutting their stuff.”<br />It all comes back to performance. “When we get dressed, everything we put on helps us build the character we want to present in the world,” he said. Here, Mr. Kors discusses his love of art, super-luxe lip balm and aviators, and how he brings his many exotic travels back home.</td>

      <td>New research shows that the older we are, the more altruistic we become</td>
      <td>Psychologist Alison Gopnik explores new discoveries in the science of human nature. Read previous columns here.<br />Like many people in their 60s, I feel that I’m less driven and ambitious than I used to be. I find myself thinking more about helping my students and children and grandchildren. But do we really get more generous and altruistic as we get older? Two new studies suggest that we do and that this change in our motivations runs deep.<br />Earlier studies had already provided some evidence that this might be true, finding that older people donate more money to charity both in real life and in hypothetical experiments and, like me, say that they care more about others. But what if older people just tend to have more money and resources than younger ones, or they don’t value money as much, so they find it easier to give it away? Or do they just want to appear more generous to the researchers?<br />Julia Spaniol at Toronto’s Ryerson University and her colleagues tried to answer these questions earlier this year by combining 16 different studies with more than 1,000 participants in a “meta-analysis” in the journal Psychology and Aging. They analyzed whether the size of the altruism effect depended on how rich or well-educated you were, whether the researchers looked at your actual behavior or what you reported about yourself, and whether the researchers knew who you were or you answered questions anonymously. None of it made any difference—the older people were just as altruistic in all the studies.<br />Patricia Lockwood at the University of Birmingham and colleagues designed a very clever new experiment, published in the journal Psychological Science in April, to ask the same question. Instead of asking people how they felt, or getting them to donate money, the researchers got them to squeeze a “dynamometer,” a machine that measures the strength of your grip. Participants could choose whether to put in effort and squeeze harder to get more points. The points translated into a small monetary reward. In half the trials, the reward would go to the participants themselves; in the other half they would go to another person. There were 150 trials, so people had a lot of chances to decide whether to go for the easier or harder choice, and they had to make the decisions quickly and intuitively, without thinking about it much.</td>

Even certain planting techniques are being abandoned by designers and landscape-architecture gurus.<br />Consider rows of ornamentals such as pansies and impatiens sidling up to hydrangea. This froufrou fantasy surged as a status symbol in the 1950s, said New York designer Laurence Carr, but is far too resource-sucking today. “Functional gardens are the way of the future,” said Ms. Carr, who sees hodgepodges of “edible plants, bushes and trees, including many native plants, pollinators and medicinals,” sprouting instead.<br />We polled scores of pros for what else counts as passe landscaping these days, and got their picks for what to plant instead.<br />Dated: Los Angeles interior designer Susan Davis Taylor’s clients used to pave paradise, opting for a concrete or flagstone pool deck “leaving very little room for natural grass or garden spaces.”<br />Up-to-date: Lawn that is brought right up to the pool coping creates a resort-like beauty. Lounges and chairs sit on minimal hardscaping and look as if they are on the grass, said Ms. Taylor. The platforms “protect the furniture from water damage while leaving a luscious green yard that goes to the pool’s edge.”</td>

      <td>In 1967, Billie Jean King was the number one women’s tennis player in the world, but she could barely support herself. The big international tournaments barred professional players, which left amateurs to subsist on shoestring per diems. Everything seemed to change the following year, when Wimbledon opened competition to moneymaking players and other tournaments followed suit. At 24, after nearly a decade on the amateur circuit, Ms. King was eager to finally earn a living as a tennis phenom. Her husband Larry, a law student at the time, was more skeptical. “Just watch,” he said. “Once men get open tennis, they’re going to squeeze the women out.”<br />“Larry was totally right,” Ms. King, 77, recalls over the phone from her home in New York City. “He understood the old-boy network better than me.”<br />Frustrated with piddling prizes and dwindling opportunities to play, in 1970 Ms. King and eight other players, later known as the “Original 9,” risked suspension to create their own professional tour. They had the backing of  Philip Morris ,  which hoped to promote its Virginia Slims cigarettes.<br />“Our livelihoods hung in the balance,” Ms. King writes in her new autobiography, “All In,” which will be published Aug. 17. By October 1971, she became the first female athlete to earn over $100,000 in a single season; President Richard Nixon called to congratulate her. In 1973 she founded the Women’s Tennis Association to organize tournaments that would offer female players better prize money and far more opportunities to play.<br />Fifty years on, tennis players are the highest paid female athletes in the world. “When a player gets a check now, it’s because we were willing to give up our career for them,” says Ms. King. “Even if you’re not a born activist, life can damn sure make you one.” Last month, the Original 9 entered the International Tennis Hall of Fame.</td>

      <td>Generous and spiteful, patriotic and paranoid, the most powerful man in American law enforcement was a study in contradiction.</td>
      <td>No one in American history wielded so much power for so long as J. Edgar Hoover. He created a peerless law-enforcement agency in his own unsmiling image and served eight presidents, from Coolidge to Nixon, none of whom dared fire him although some yearned to see him gone. He ruled his FBI with an autocratic hand, micromanaged his national celebrity, and cozied up to cafe society at New York’s Stork Club, especially gossip columnist Walter Winchell. He palled around with singer Frankie Laine and movie stars like Jimmy Stewart—he even chatted up Marilyn Monroe. He loved dogs and racehorses, “Gunsmoke” and “Rawhide,” steak and potatoes and, in moderation, Jack Daniel’s Black Label. But what was he really like?<br />The shelves are laden with books about Hoover and his bureau—idolatrous, iconoclastic, one even claiming the imperious G-man liked to prance around after hours in full drag. But there has never been an account quite like “The Director: My Years Assisting J. Edgar Hoover,” by Paul Letersky (with veteran journalist Gordon Dillow). In the mid-1960s the author, then in his early 20s, spent three years as a junior member of Hoover’s tiny office staff and five more as a special agent, and he has mined his experience to draw a vivid, foibles-and-all portrait of the fabled scourge of gangsters, Klansmen and communists, who died in 1972 after 48 years on the job.<br />This is no hagiography. The fearsome director, he writes, was “kind, courteous, thoughtful, fearless, sometimes funny, a perfect gentleman, and a devout patriot” but also “vindictive, close-minded, hypercritical, a man of intense hatreds and eternal grudges, a man who in his sincere belief that he was protecting his country had repeatedly violated the principles of the Constitution on which that country was founded.” In short, a “strange and remarkable,” “fascinating and perplexing” creature.<br />Older Americans are marinated in the Hoover legend, thanks to the slick FBI publicity machine that touted his and the bureau’s exploits in complaisant newspapers and magazines, movies like “The House on 92nd Street” and “The FBI Story,” and the long-running ABC television series “The FBI,” starring the handsome Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as a dashing special agent. For others, Hoover is a pug-nosed wraith from some long-gone America of machine-gun toting mobsters and commie spies. Mr. Letersky’s riveting book will be fresh meat for people who think they know all about Hoover and an education for the rest.<br />Put in charge of the tiny, corrupt Bureau of Investigation in 1924, when he was not yet 30, Hoover invented the new Federal Bureau of Investigation and ruled it from its birth to his own death. He created the FBI crime lab with its forensic wizardry, the FBI academy to train agents and local and state police, the fingerprint records that ultimately held more than 200 million cards, and those “secret files” supposedly full of dirt on presidents, lesser pols, business titans and celebrities. He set weight, height and appearance standards for agents old and new, even including a ban on applicants with “pear-shaped” heads. Violation of any of Hoover’s countless norms meant transfer to one of the bureau’s punishment outposts, like Billings, Mont., or dismissal “with prejudice.”</td>

      <td>Households with an additional 1.6 million children received payments on Friday</td>
      <td>The second monthly payment of child tax credits reached the households of nearly 61 million children, the Treasury Department said. That is a 2.7% increase from July, indicating that more people are being added to the program than are leaving through taxpayers’ decisions to opt out of the regular payments.<br />Friday’s payments of up to $300 per child totaled $15.4 billion, and they come as Democrats try to build political momentum to extend the expanded tax credit beyond its scheduled Dec. 31 expiration.<br />The March coronavirus-relief law expanded the credit in several ways. It raised the amount from $2,000 per child to $3,000 for children ages six to 17 and to $3,600 for those under six. Families with little or no income can now get the full amounts. Previously, those households were limited to getting $1,400 of the $2,000 credit. And it is delivered in the middle of every month instead of as part of the annual tax refund, creating something approaching a universal child allowance.<br />A Census Bureau survey released this week found that households with children reported having an easier time paying for food after the July payments were delivered.<br />Treasury Department officials also have been trying to make sure that eligible households sign up. That is a particular challenge for low-income families who don’t normally file tax returns.</td>

The two had a “lively discussion,” the union said.<br />Hours later, Mr. Lafortune was dropped off by unidentified people at a hospital with broken arms and a gash in his throat, said another legal clerk working with him. At the hospital, Mr. Lafortune was pronounced dead, leaving behind a wife and at least two children, the clerk said.<br />The hospital where Mr. Lafortune was taken couldn’t be determined. His family members and the judge couldn’t be reached to comment.<br />“Is it a coincidence that he is dead? Look at it: It is not a coincidence,” the legal clerk said. “It’s a clear signal that shows that a clerk cannot work on this case.”</td>

      <td>Telescopes explore the stars, but the invention of the timepiece sought to model the workings of heaven.</td>
      <td>For generations, the Royal Observatory in Greenwich tested each of the British Navy’s chronometers. These precision instruments—deck clocks used to calculate longitude and thus fix a ship’s position at sea—helped ensure safe navigation. The observatory’s testing room hummed with activity: “What a wonderful instance of the proof of our maritime power is this apartment!” exclaimed one 19th-century astronomer.<br />Yet power can be a burden, and observatory staff began to tire of visitors bearing chronometers who interrupted official business to ask for the time. In 1836, an observatory assistant started taking a precisely accurate pocket watch out to chronometer makers for weekly visits instead. His wife assumed the task after his death, and their daughter carried on the work until World War II. Hand to hand, from the Prime Meridian throughout London and then across the sea, time was delivered. In this way, clocks made empire.<br />If timepieces could empower, they could also dominate. As David Rooney, a former curator at the Royal Observatory, writes in “About Time: A History of Civilization in Twelve Clocks,” the British used timekeeping as one more tool of imperial repression. Colonial authorities marked noon each day at the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa by firing a cannon: hardly subtle. Some 100 British-built clock towers stood out over the landscape of India during the colonial period, reminding residents who was in charge. Nor did the British have a monopoly on horological symbolism. Mr. Rooney writes that, “wherever we are, as far back as we care to look, we can find that monumental timekeepers mounted high up on towers or public buildings have been put there to keep us in order.”<br />“About Time” is a fascinating volume on what clocks say both to us and about us, from the Roman sundial to the GPS satellite. Our ancestors have used timepieces to make war, seek peace, advance knowledge and enforce virtue. Every clock has some ulterior motive—political, social, economic—beyond merely measuring time, Mr. Rooney asserts. In its omnipresence and adaptability, the clock becomes a totem of the human experience, like currency. Mr. Rooney offers not a comprehensive study of timekeeping but instead an episodic survey. “About Time” is obviously not for those who shrug off the need for a proper wristwatch by saying they can just check their phones. For readers with a longer view, though, and a taste for intellectual history, it is full of riches.<br />Time and faith go hand in hand, Mr. Rooney writes. “In the Sikh religion, prayers are offered during an early-morning period called Amrit Vela, at dusk and at nighttime. In Hinduism, time is God. In Buddhism, time only exists in our minds—and perhaps our nostrils, as incense-burning clocks were used to mark the passage of time in Buddhist ceremonies in Korea, Japan and China for hundreds of years.” As mechanical timepieces appeared in the 13th century, replacing sundials and water clocks, craftsmen tried to replicate the heavens through earthly designs, fashioning devices whose internal wheels would make revolutions akin to celestial motion. “The idea behind this thinking was that the universe was God’s prototype,” Mr. Rooney writes: “Could humans make production versions of that prototype?”</td>

      <td>A look back into deep time reveals an American landscape of upheaval and transformation.</td>
      <td>All summer, the soot from massive western wildfires has been casting a haze over clear eastern skies. When in Minneapolis-St. Paul on a recent family visit, I watched that soot paint the full moon a creamy orange. When flying back east over the Great Lakes, I saw that soot as a dirty brown layer sandwiched between blue stratosphere and freshwater sea. When back on the ground in New England, I breathed air that toggled in quality between unhealthy and excellent.<br />Earth scientist John Dvorak’s exuberant new book “How the Mountains Grew: A New Geological History of North America” puts these Anthropocene fires into the context of deep time. In his chapter “Fires, Forests, and Coal” he describes “black grimy” layers of fire fallout thick enough to blanket the globe with a soft charcoal called fusain. “Fires probably raged through the year,” he concludes, thanks to an excess of oxygen. “In fact, for tens of millions of years, much of the surface of the Earth was probably shrouded beneath a planet-wide haze of fire-produced soot.” Life not only survived, it thrived. “The giant dragonflies, the spiders with eighteen-inch legs and the fifty-pound scorpions rarely, if ever, had a clear sunny day.”<br />In one of Earth’s grandest ironies, those 300-million-year-old fires forced trees to evolve a thick protective bark that led to dense, tall stands of an ancient tree called Lepidodendron that dominated the Carboniferous Period. Those in coastal swamps flooded by a rising sea blew down to form thick seams of coal that would, much later, fuel a global industrial civilization addicted to cheap energy. Carbon-rich gas exhausted into the atmosphere warmed the planet to the point where raging fires are now, once again, the new norm. All life is being forced to adapt, not to something evil, but to an integrated planetary system that gave birth to life and still controls our human fates. We are not in charge.<br />Mr. Dvorak—a geophysicist turned volcanologist turned astronomer turned writer—is a wonderful storyteller. Based on personal experience from “fifty years of travel and four years of writing” he weaves disparate threads of past worlds into a coherent fabric of time, place and life that provides the ultimate context for all specific modern environmental issues. Of feathered dinosaurs terrifying the land. Of global sea levels a thousand feet higher than today’s. Of a Snowball Earth encased by ice. Of a Jurassic atmosphere with four times more carbon dioxide than today. Of an asteroid impact so large that the night sky glowed incandescent red with molten droplets of rock.<br />When reading “How the Mountains Grew,” I could easily imagine being outdoors with him breaking rocks in a search for fossils, crawling up some canyon wall to count the sands of time or trekking across one of our great ice sheets. His human stories are also fascinating, especially those involving serendipitous discoveries. He finds paleontologists most interesting, seismologists most self-assured, volcanologists most adventurous and mining geologists most passionate.</td>

      <td>Payments went to tens of millions of households</td>
      <td>The second monthly payments of the child tax credit hit Americans’ bank accounts Friday, continuing an experiment in family and fiscal policy. Democrats tout the monthly payments as a way to reduce child poverty and change annual lump-sum tax refunds into a more reliable stream of income. Republicans have criticized the changes for breaking the prior link between the credit and earned income.<br />The child tax credit is a federal benefit that reduces income tax liability for people with children. It was created in 1997 and since then has expanded several times. It is a credit that reduces taxes owed as opposed to a deduction that reduces taxable income. The temporary changes in effect for 2021 make it a near-universal monthly child allowance, far from the annual tax break it started as. The changes came about as part of the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus bill passed in March.<br />Here is how it works.<br />Until 2021, the credit was $2,000 per child under age 17, based on the child’s age at the end of the year. For 2021 only, Congress increased the credit to $3,000 for children ages 6 to 17 and $3,600 for children under age 6.<br />On the low end, there were limits, but they have been removed for this year. Until 2021, low-income households that didn’t owe income taxes could get as much as $1,400 of the $2,000 credit. This year, they can get the full credit even if they have no income.</td>

They got another job offer.<br />Now they have a secret.<br />A small, dedicated group of white-collar workers, in industries from tech to banking to insurance, say they have found a way to double their pay: Work two full-time remote jobs, don’t tell anyone and, for the most part, don’t do too much work, either.<br />Alone in their home offices, they toggle between two laptops. They play “Tetris” with their calendars, trying to dodge endless meetings. Sometimes they log on to two meetings at once. They use paid time off—in some cases, unlimited—to juggle the occasional big project or ramp up at a new gig. Many say they don’t work more than 40 hours a week for both jobs combined. They don’t apologize for taking advantage of a system they feel has taken advantage of them.<br />“It’s two jobs for one,” says a 29-year-old software engineer who has been working simultaneously for a media company and an events company since June. He estimates he was logging three to 10 hours of actual work a week back when he held down one job. “The rest of it is just attending meetings and pretending to look busy.”</td>

      <td>It’s National Kool Aid Day, celebrating a beverage that has survived some highly negative associations over the decades</td>
      <td>For the rest of the world it’s Friday the 13th, but in Hastings, Neb., it’s National Kool-Aid Day. It was there in 1927 that local legend Edwin Perkins invented the powdered, sugary beverage now owned by food giant  Kraft Heinz .  It became the state’s official soft drink in 1998 and is celebrated every August.<br />A town embracing its claim to fame isn’t surprising at all, but the fact that Kool-Aid has lasted so long is. Marketed to children since the 1950s with an anthropomorphic jug who bursts through walls, it would have a less-wholesome association in the 60s with the publication of Tom Wolfe’s “The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test,” the true story of how the beverage was laced with LSD by “the Merry Pranksters.” Far, far worse was what happened a decade later when either Kool-Aid or a similar drink—reports vary—was laced with poison in the mass suicide at Jonestown in 1978.<br />The phrase “drink the Kool-Aid” has since developed less-sinister connotations, but none of them positive. More to the point, actually drinking even unadulterated Kool-Aid, now marketed disproportionately toward minorities in our health-conscious era, still isn’t very good for you. “Long-term consumption may increase the risk of obesity, diabetes, and even cancer,” says Isitbadforyou.com.<br />Write to Spencer Jakab at spencer.jakab@wsj.com</td>

      <td>I recently met a woman who quit her job after 11 years working for the same organization. The pandemic was stressful, but it was the hybrid meetings that did her in.<br />“During the pandemic we were all in the same boat—trying to work with our kids screaming in the background or our partners fighting with us over the one ‘good’ corner of the house to work,” she said. But several months ago, most of her team started coming back to the office. She and a handful of others stayed remote.<br />Over those months she noticed a growing communications divide between the in-office and remote people. During meetings, the office people would direct their comments to each other instead of to their screens. They would tell inside jokes and forget to call on the remote people. Sometimes they would stand around at the end of the meeting laughing; the remote people were stuck watching.<br />She felt like a ghost on the wall—watching her team interact but unable to contribute in any meaningful way.<br />After months of feeling socially excluded and left behind, she quit.</td>
