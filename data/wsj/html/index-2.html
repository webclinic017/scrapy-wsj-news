      <td>It gives the Supreme Court an opportunity to revive the separation of powers.</td>
      <td>Hours after President Biden’s Sept. 9 speech announcing a series of vaccine mandates for private-sector employees, his chief of staff, Ron Klain, retweeted an MSNBC anchor’s quip that wielding workplace-safety regulation to force vaccinations was “the ultimate work-around.” Congress has never enacted a law requiring American civilians to be vaccinated—assuming it even has the constitutional authority to do so, which is doubtful. The Supreme Court hears arguments Friday on two of the mandates, which are likely to meet the same fate as other recent attempts to circumvent Congress that the courts have rejected.<br />The Constitution vests the power to make laws in Congress and charges the president with the duty to execute them. That’s what many in Washington derisively call the “high school civics class” model of government. It’s slow, it’s cumbersome, it rarely approves measures that don’t enjoy widespread public support, and it forces compromise, moderation and tailoring of policies to address the circumstances of a vast and varied nation. The temptation of avoiding it via executive fiat is obvious.</td>

Tehran is striding toward nuclear weapons and has little interest in a diplomatic breakthrough.<br />That makes it almost certain that President Biden will soon face the fateful choice between allowing the clerical regime to become a nuclear-weapons power and using military force to stop it. The red line for military action will come when Iran’s timeline to sprint to a nuclear weapon shrinks to less than the Pentagon’s response time. On the current trajectory, that could happen early this year. If and when it does, the president should order military strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities to prevent Tehran from building the bomb.</td>

Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev fired his cabinet and reinstituted price controls, but it wasn’t enough for a population fed up with much more than expensive liquefied petroleum gas.

Prosecutors will “make incarceration a matter of last resort,” with a strong presumption against jail or prison for offenses other than murder, armed violent felonies that cause serious injury, domestic violence, sex crimes, public corruption, racketeering and white-collar crimes.

      <td>Beijing has developed a reputation for blocking imports from countries it wants to punish. Australian wine became a target last year. Now China is punching back at Lithuania, which recently allowed Taiwan to open a representative office in Vilnius. But here’s the new twist: China is holding up not only Lithuanian imports, but all imports that include Lithuanian parts. The effects are rippling across Europe.<br />In 2020 Lithuania exported goods worth $350 million to China—an increase over previous years but peanuts in overall trade. Lithuania has long imported far more from China than vice versa; last year, about four times as much. So Lithuania’s government perhaps calculated that the country’s economy could handle whatever retaliation China inflicted for the gesture to Taiwan.</td>

He also believed that the American frontier had ceased to exist by 1890, but only because he assigned insufficient importance to Alaska. The disjunct territory that did not become a state until 1959 continues to exist in our imagination—and in truth—as a place where Old World versions of wilderness survive, where Americans can still court danger, take the measure of their resourcefulness and perhaps reinvent themselves. Millions of us at home can watch this in process on such reality TV shows as “The Deadliest Catch.”</td>

      <td>The hero of “A Hero” looks heroic from the first moment we see him full-face. He’s strikingly handsome, with a trim beard, piercing eyes and a radiant smile. That will change—not only his looks but how we perceive him. Almost everyone, and everything we think we know about them, changes constantly in Asghar Farhadi’s latest morality tale, in Persian with English subtitles; it’s his finest work since his Oscar-winning “A Separation” a decade ago. People do the right thing, then the wrong thing, then things that are right for the wrong reasons or wrong for even wronger reasons. Half the time they have little or no idea what they’re doing because their good side doesn’t know what their bad side is concocting. This astute, subversively funny film fills a broad canvas. Mainly, though, it’s about long division, the all-too-human state of being permanently and unwittingly split down the middle. (Currently in select theaters, “A Hero” will move to Amazon Prime Video on Jan. 21.)<br />The setting is Shiraz, a city in southwestern Iran, and the title is ironic, for reasons that emerge from a chain of events with a special kind of gravity; they’re deadly serious for all concerned, yet worthy of a Preston Sturges comedy. (Specifically his classic “Hail the Conquering Hero,” the one in which a World War II G.I. discharged for hay fever concocts a story about having been wounded in combat.) The ostensible paragon in this case is a former sign painter and calligrapher named Rahim (Amir Jadidi). When the movie opens Rahim is just starting a two-day pass from a prison to which he was sent for failure to pay a three-year-old business debt. (His creditor, Bahram, is played by Mohsen Tanabandeh.) Things are looking up, though. Rahim’s girlfriend, Farkhondeh (Sahar Goldust), has found 17 gold coins in a bag someone lost; they’ll go a long way toward satisfying the creditor and getting Rahim out of prison.</td>

      <td>After the death of a friend, three women try to reinvent themselves in Fox’s sitcom.</td>
      <td>All sitcoms have a central joke, a kind of trunk that keeps them stable and erect through their seasonal lifespans and on which gags are hung like ornaments. At first blush, “Pivoting,” which makes its debut Sunday on Fox, seems based on the barely arguable point that women are asked to do far more than is possible, men are asked to do far less, and the math is somehow hilarious.<br />And yet the half-hour comedy, created by Liz Astrof and starring Eliza Coupe, Ginnifer Goodwin and Maggie Q, turns out to be about something a bit more complicated, even profound, and potentially funnier in the long run: people resisting their natural inclinations and temperaments in order to be “better” people. Better for whom? That’s the question.</td>

      <td>The Irish Repertory Theatre scores once again in its revival of Charlotte Moore’s song-filled adaptation of Dion Boucicault’s 19th-century play</td>
      <td>New York<br />Theater lovers throughout America owe a huge debt to the Irish Repertory Theatre for having kept us sane and entertained by streaming exemplary, standard-setting video productions throughout the Covid-19 lockdown. Now the Irish Rep, for me New York’s finest off-Broadway theater, is reopening its doors with a revival of Charlotte Moore’s 2002 musical version of Dion Boucicault’s “The Streets of New York.” In his play, the celebrated 19th-century theatrical ne’er-do-well, who died in New York in 1890 after spending his career shuttling back and forth across the Atlantic, told a succulent tale of melodramatic woe. It is greatly enhanced by Ms. Moore’s songs and is performed to the hilt by her new cast (a fine director, she has also staged this production).</td>

Jones, echoing several of the Ailey friends and company members who appear throughout, including Judith Jamison, George Faison and Masazumi Chaya. Mr. Jones speculates that his onetime collaborator suffered the “demon” that often torments those who rise from humble origins to great heights. “If I’ve gotten this far,” he says, rhetorically, “I must have pulled one over on somebody. And any day now, I may be found out.”</td>

The problem they target—partisan spending by public officials—may be real, but their proposed ban is a significant infringement on free speech. Contributions by the private sector, whether by Mark Zuckerberg or Charles Koch, should be fully protected. But public-sector recipients of those contributions must not spend them in a politically discriminatory manner.<br />Under current law, unlimited private, independent expenditures on behalf of candidates or parties are permissible. Direct contributions to candidates and parties are, regrettably, capped. They should not be. Ditto for private contributions to fund elections. Mr. Zuckerberg should have every right to fund get-out-the-vote drives in Democratic, but not Republican, districts (although he denies that allegation). Voluntary contributions for such purposes are preferable to coerced taxpayer funding. On the other hand, the law should prohibit expenditures by public-sector officials that favor any party or candidate.</td>

      <td>How a new class of weapons upended the foundations of Western society and led to a race for technological supremacy that continues today.</td>
      <td>No one knows exactly when gunpowder, a Chinese invention dating to the ninth century, arrived in the West. The English natural philosopher and cleric Roger Bacon described its formula—sulphur, charcoal, saltpeter—in the late 13th century; it did not take long for that new knowledge to be put to awesome use. Protocannons known as bombards were monstrous and crude but devastating. Mons Meg, a siege bombard cast in the Low Countries in 1449, could throw a 300-pound chipped-stone ball a distance of 2 miles at a speed of 700 miles an hour—just shy of the speed of sound. Knocking down castle walls had never been so easy. Within a century of their first appearance in the early 1300s, these new engines of war ousted the English from France, the Moors from Spain and the Byzantine dynasty from Constantinople.<br />In “Firepower,” a sweeping survey of the evolution of the weapons of war from the late Middle Ages through World War II, Paul Lockhart follows the cascading events that the advent of gunpowder set off. In the half millennium after their invention, gunpowder weapons fundamentally changed the way armies trained, fought and organized themselves. These weapons also, in Mr. Lockhart’s argument, upended the very foundations of Western society and political order.</td>

      <td>‘Kidcore’—a fad that sees adult men conjure their tweenage years with expressive, if juvenile, outfits—has thrived during the pandemic. Why the style is resonating and how to strike a somewhat age-appropriate balance.</td>
      <td>IT HAD BEEN a youthful year for men’s fashion. Cutesy charm necklaces often encircled the necks of Pete Davidson and Justin Bieber, making those shlumpy style icons—and paparazzi favorites—look like they’d been sprung from summer camp. Last November, Washington Wizard Kyle Kuzma pulled up to the locker room in a pink Raf Simons sweater with gigundo sleeves, calling to mind a kid wearing his big brother’s hand-me-downs. And fashion companies minted adult-size clothes with serious  Children’s Place  overtones. British label JW Anderson’s spring offering was littered with sweaters and other pieces in cutesy strawberry prints, while  Urban Outfitters  carries a “doodle” hoodie covered in infantilizing smiley faces.<br />This adult embrace of dressing like a tweenager has a name: “kidcore.” While it’s been simmering for a while (the 2018 explosion of tie-dye was an early indicator), kidcore has soared during the pandemic. You might theorize that men found solace in dressing like their preteen selves: Lyst, a British company that tracks the behavior of more than 150 million online shoppers in 2021, ranked kidcore as one of its top trends of 2021, based largely on the strength of searches for things like charm necklaces and cartoony  Crocs .  “A lot of people were searching for comfort and familiarity,” said Pierre Lavenir, a cultural specialist at Lyst.</td>

      <td>The late Italian writer Augusto Del Noce saw its ironic triumph coming in the West.</td>
      <td>When I was a teenager, I spent a year meeting weekly with a psychiatrist. In the end, talking about myself bored even me. But the value of the sessions was real. They gave me, at a turbulent time in my life, a chance to speak honestly and deeply with another human being without the hand-wringing of my family or the burden of guilt. For many, psychiatrists and other mental-health counselors have replaced the clergy as healers of the soul. Today, science too often and too easily seems to preclude the hunger for God. But at least modern therapists share something important—their humanity—with their patients. Both are creatures of flesh and blood.<br />But the world is changing. Robots with clinical psychology expertise may still sound like a joke, but artificial-intelligence alternatives to human therapists no longer belong to “The Twilight Zone.” Quite the opposite. AI is already used to scan medical records, social-media posts, and similar data for mental-illness indicators and potential therapies. For the moment, medical experts are duly cautious. In the words of John Torous, director of the digital psychiatry division at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, AI-driven chatbot therapy may sound exciting, but “we are not yet seeing evidence matching marketing.” The modern, and especially American, addiction to technology as the answer to every problem may be excessive, but it would not have surprised Augusto Del Noce. And therein lies a cautionary tale.</td>

It reported that same-store sales in the quarter ended Nov. 27 fell 7% compared with a year earlier—much more than the 0.9% decline analysts had been expecting. Some of that had to do with problems beyond its control. Without supply-chain snags, the company said, it would have sold $100 million more. But some are of management’s own making: The company last year got rid of too many printed circulars, which it later realized were an important traffic driver. Even after deciding to correct the issue, paper-supply problems last quarter meant the retailer couldn’t print those out as quickly as it wanted to.</td>

      <td>We’re in an acrimonious period of partisan tribalism and have been for some time. Both parties are guilty of overwrought denunciations of their political opponents. My criticisms are often aimed at Democrats; on the anniversary of Jan. 6, I’m addressing squarely those Republicans who for a year have excused the actions of the rioters who stormed the Capitol, disrupted Congress as it received the Electoral College’s results, and violently attempted to overturn the election.<br />These apologists say those who stormed the Capitol were innocent patriots, tourists visiting the seat of the national government to petition their elected representatives peacefully. We’re told that these harmless, ordinary Americans are being persecuted as political prisoners.</td>

      <td>Current ‘net zero’ plans will cost many trillions while doing little to slow global warming.</td>
      <td>Energy prices are soaring, and it’s likely a sign of things to come. The rise can be blamed on a variety of things, including the demand rebound after the lockdowns ended, a drop in renewable electricity output from a lack of wind in Europe during most of 2021, and increasingly costly climate policies. But while the pandemic will end and the wind will blow again, climate policies to achieve “net zero” emissions will keep hiking prices.<br />Barack Obama acknowledged in 2008 that electricity prices “would necessarily skyrocket” under his proposed climate policies. He was more candid than many of today’s politicians and advocates. Limiting the use of fossil fuels requires making them more expensive and pushing people toward green alternatives that remain pricier and less efficient.</td>

      <td>That’s a legal term that denotes much more than a sporadically violent riot or disturbance.</td>
      <td>The events of Jan. 6, 2021, are misunderstood, and the failure to correct the record could be damaging to both America’s future and its justice system. Words have to have meaning, and the continuous mislabeling of the U.S. Capitol breach as an “insurrection” is an example of how a false narrative can gain currency and cause dangerous injustice.<br />Many crimes undoubtedly took place at the Capitol that day. Demonstrators rioted, destroyed government property and in some instances engaged in acts of violence. Many are charged with violating 18 U.S.C. 371, which makes it a crime “to commit any offense against the United States, or to defraud the United States,” and with underlying charges of civil disorder, disorderly conduct, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, destruction of government property, and obstruction of an official proceeding.</td>

      <td>After 12 boys and their chaperone were trapped in a flooded cave half a mile below ground, only a few people in the world could save them.</td>
      <td>On June 23, 2018, 12 boys—members of the Wild Boars soccer team—and an assistant coach wandered into the Tham Luang Nang Non cave in northern Thailand. The boys ranged in age from 11 to 16, the coach was 25. The official monsoon season hadn’t begun; if it had, the cave would have been closed. But rain began falling—lots of it—and when the young adventurers tried to turn back, they discovered that they were trapped, with more than half a mile of rock above them and 21/2 miles of flooding cave behind them.<br />Three days later, Vernon Unsworth, a British spelunker on site outside the cave, persuaded government officials that if the boys were to be saved, consummate cave divers would be needed. The next day, Rick Stanton and two colleagues landed in Thailand.</td>
