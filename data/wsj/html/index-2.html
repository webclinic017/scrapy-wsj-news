      <td>Friends, Americans, citizens of the world, lend me your ears. I come to bury Christopher Columbus, not to praise him.<br />In Shakespeare’s famous Marc Antony speech, he speaks of Julius Caesar’s “grievous fault” of ambition, and of the honorable nature of Caesar’s friend and assassin, Brutus. Antony then subverts the accusations against Caesar, skillfully and sarcastically reminding the gathered crowd of Caesar’s achievements and love of the Roman people—and how they all used to love him in return.</td>

      <td>A ‘whistleblower,’ not Trump officials, delayed funding for molnupiravir.</td>
      <td>When Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics announced on Oct. 1 that their new antiviral pill reduced Covid hospitalizations by roughly half, some in the media blamed Donald Trump. An Axios headline: “Before Merck backed COVID antiviral, Trump admin turned it down.” In fact, Trump officials pushed for government funding to accelerate the development of the drug, molnupiravir. They were opposed by a career official, Rick Bright, whom Democrats praised as a “whistleblower.”<br />Mr. Bright joined the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority in 2010 and became Barda’s director in 2016. The authority, part of the Health and Human Services Department, is charged with preparing for and responding to public-health threats. After Mr. Bright repeatedly clashed with HHS officials, he was reassigned in April 2020 to a lower-level job at the National Institutes of Health. Mr. Bright then filed a complaint accusing Trump officials of pressuring him to fast-track unsafe drugs and award contracts “based on political connections and cronyism.”</td>

      <td>As the cryptocurrency universe expands, with innovative offerings and thousands of new users each week, the U.S. regulatory response has been slow and uneven.<br />In certain areas, U.S. regulators have successfully applied traditional models. The Securities and Exchange Commission treats those who issue new speculative cryptocurrencies like issuers of securities. The Treasury Department’s anti-money-laundering office, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, regulates firms that transfer or exchange cryptocurrencies as money-service businesses—like  Western Union —with the accompanying responsibility of knowing their customers and monitoring for suspicious activity.</td>

      <td>Another year in which the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to a writer I’ve never read—and I’m beginning to despair. Is the Swedish Nobel committee setting out to show me up as a philistine? I ask myself that question even as I declare that I’m a hungry reader and have what might be called an elite education. So a detachment from the matter at hand—fine (even difficult) novels and poetry—is not what ails me.<br />At least this year’s winner—Abdulrazak Gurnah, an Anglo-Tanzanian novelist from Zanzibar—has been on my to-read list for years. I’ve given priority to other, probably better African novelists, including some, such as Ngugi wa Thiongo, who haven’t yet found favor with the Swedes. At least I’d heard of Mr. Gurnah, unlike last year, when Louise Glück, a very recondite American poet, was foisted on an unsuspecting world as the lit laureate. Even in her own country, yawps of consternation were heard. (My biggest gain from the episode was to chance upon the German word Glückschmerz, which means sadness—or, in my case, indignation—over someone else’s success.)</td>

      <td>If you think Covid restrictions are onerous, try going on a cruise, as I did recently. The Adriatic coastline was beautiful, and the staff was lovely, but the Covid rules were jarring. We all had to prove we were vaccinated to board. But the cruise line also required that we submit to a daily PCR test and temperature checks and even wear a tracking device—a small medallion on a necklace, tied in to the ship’s computer. Despite all this, we were told to wear masks in all the ship’s common areas, not only indoors but out and during walking tours ashore.<br />I was on Viking, and the rules vary slightly from line to line, but the vaccination and mask requirements are typical on European trips. Making matters even more confusing are the different rules at various ports and for passengers depending on citizenship or residency. The U.K. “red list” rules meant our stop in Montenegro had to be canceled: All British travelers who visit a country on the list are forced into hotel quarantine on returning home, at their own expense. For Americans, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s changing list of at-risk countries meant concern over whether travel insurance would be valid.</td>

Guggenheim. In the shelter of Guggenheim’s faux-Norman castle, Falaise, Lindbergh famously retired to a guest room and revised the ghostwritten, error-riddled account of his flight, “We.”<br />But even devoted prop-heads are not likely to know that it was Guggenheim who conceived, planned and financed Lindbergh’s famous goodwill tour over the summer after he returned from crossing the Atlantic. During that three-month excursion across the country, Lindbergh flew his “Spirit of St. Louis” monoplane to packed events in 92 American towns and cities across the 48 continental states. The Lone Eagle’s continental tour cemented his fame and helped turn American aviation into a growth industry for the next half century.</td>

The hospital trust fund is set to run dry in 2026, and Democrats worry that expensive drugs aren’t affordable. But then why do they want to add hugely expensive new coverage for dental, hearing and vision care?<br />Democrats claim that half of Medicare recipients have no dental insurance, but they’re overstating the coverage gap. Nearly nine in 10 low-income seniors have access to dental coverage through Medicaid. AARP sponsors dental plans with low premiums, and many graduate dental schools offer charity care for low-income seniors.</td>

In Europe energy prices have risen by a factor of five in the last year, and Vladimir Putin is exploiting the situation for Russia’s gain. It’s a reminder that America’s energy production is a source of strategic strength that it risks trading away for climate dreams.<br />Europe’s energy system, which has sought to banish domestic fossil fuels, has left the Continent vulnerable to the global surge in oil and gas prices. The Financial Timesreports that “the strength of the wind blowing across northern Europe has fallen by as much as 15 per cent” in 2021. That’s reduced the productivity of European wind farms and increased reliance on natural gas, of which Russia is the main supplier.</td>

If the IRS truly wanted to increase receipts, it should start by cashing the checks it receives.<br />Shortly after my mother passed away in January 2020, the first “stimulus” check was deposited in her bank account. After some diligent searching on the IRS’s nonuser-friendly website, I was able to find a way to return it. I did so, with a cover letter. As of today, many months later, the check has not been cashed. I guess when Congress gives the IRS its $80 billion, it will hire someone who knows how to fill out a deposit slip.</td>

      <td>‘No Time to Die” is the latest James Bond episode and the last one to star Daniel Craig. His performance elevates—all but ennobles—the dramatic core of an otherwise choppy narrative, a succession of impressive but impersonal action sequences and affecting interludes that lead to a stirring climax.<br />Time figures in more than the title. The film evokes time’s haunting passage— how long its hitherto indestructible hero has been saving the planet from a bountiful supply of malefactors, how much the years and decades have given and taken from him. (The running time, not incidentally, is 163 minutes, including some late-stage sags. It is in theaters Wednesday.) When the story gets up to speed after a short, pungent preface, Bond and the woman he has cautiously allowed himself to love, Léa Seydoux’s psychiatrist Madeleine Swann, are in a car on a cliff-clinging road in southern Italy. It’s not just any car but the same venerable Aston Martin DB5 in which they drove off happily at the end of the 2015 “Spectre.” Now, in the afterglow of their getaway, she wants him to drive faster, but he resists “We have all the time in the world,” he says serenely.</td>

Rounding up those votes proved challenging, as Republicans had pledged to force Democrats to raise the debt ceiling themselves and were reluctant to give in.</td>

The plan consists of two pillars. The first is a major overhaul to century-old rules for taxing large companies, aimed especially at tech firms. The second is a new global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, which is supposed to limit tax-policy competition among governments.</td>

Mr. Kagan relies on some just-so oversimplification, but we’d be foolish not to see the risk of civil disorder and legal shenanigans as high no matter who loses in 2024. Downtowns were boarded up on the eve of the 2020 race not against angry and aggrieved Trump voters. Rural riots are hardly a thing. It was in deeply blue areas that local officials feared mass violence if the election didn’t turn out the way Democrats wanted.</td>

Though conscious of Covid restrictions, brands found ways of opening up the party to a wider audience than the usual editors and buyers. In a notably novel reinvention of the standard format, Balenciaga’s creative director Demna Gvasalia masterminded a Paris screening, complete with red carpet, of a film made in collaboration with the creative team from “The Simpsons.” The brand also posted the (hilarious) short for all to see on YouTube.<br />In New York, Tory Burch took over a block of Mercer Street, the site of her new shop, for a festive street fair that she kicked off with a runway procession down the cobblestones. In Paris, Valentino’s Pierpaolo Piccioli infiltrated the Carreau du Temple market square with models parading past unassuming cafe denizens. And everywhere in the City of Lights, uninvited fashion fans gathered at the periphery of shows to cheer. At the Chloé outing on the banks of the Seine, producer Alexandre de Betak marveled at how followers always manage to find the best perch from which to watch the show at a distance. “It’s like they have a Parisian sixth sense,” he said.</td>

      <td>Pizza-making at home is the new pandemic craze, but it can seem intimidating. Here’s the ultimate guide to get you going: from party-friendly backyard pizza ovens to insider recipes, topping tips and much more.</td>
      <td>IT WAS as good a reason as any to make pizza: “During the pandemic, I needed to have some sort of passion,” said Frédéric della Faille, a product designer in New York City.<br />He found the intervals between hydrating his dough and adding salt, the kneading and the observations of the dough’s fermentation over a few days in his refrigerator “a great meditative process.” It added structure to weeks that could otherwise seem formless. The process was, for him, as important as the product. “I didn’t even eat a tenth of the dough I made.”</td>

      <td>Nearly 140 countries agreed Friday to the most sweeping overhaul of global tax rules in a century, a move that aims to curtail tax avoidance by multinational corporations and raise additional tax revenue of as much as $150 billion annually.<br />But the accord, which is a decade in the making, now must be implemented by the signatories, a path that is likely to be far from smooth, including in a closely divided U.S. Congress.</td>

      <td>Kellogg workers unleash a wave of cereal offenders on the internet</td>
      <td>This week about 1,400 workers at  Kellogg  went on strike. One thing is clear: The Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union doesn’t represent Kellogg‘s marketing department. Photos showed a single picketer drawing on his employer’s iconic brands—Frosted Flakes mascot Tony the Tiger declaring “I’m Greedy,” without so much as an extra “r.” For a campaign aimed at a company with products ranging from Rice Krispies to Pop-Tarts, Bear Naked and Cheez-It, it is a missed opportunity.<br />Luckily, the internet rose to the occasion. One commenter on  Twitter  said the strikers “should milk it for all it’s worth.” More than one advised them to “snap, crackle and stop.”</td>

The deal includes the budget arm Air India Express and a 50% stake in an airport-services joint venture with Singapore’s  SATS Ltd.</td>

      <td>Illumina’s CEO Francis deSouza explains the Grail diagnostic test and the FTC action that risks slowing it down.</td>
      <td>Scientific breakthroughs are sometimes a matter of serendipity. Eight years ago Meredith Halks-Miller, a pathologist at the genetic-screening company  Illumina ,  stumbled on something unusual while running prenatal blood tests for fetal chromosomal abnormalities. In some blood samples, the fetal genes were normal but the maternal DNA wasn’t. Illumina alerted pregnant women’s doctors to the finding. After further investigation, all the women were diagnosed with cancer, though none had symptoms when their blood was drawn.<br />This discovery led to the development of a blood test that can now detect 50 types of cancer and has the potential to save tens of thousands of lives a year if it becomes widely available. But regulators may slow the process.</td>

So was my friend Travis Williams. Kent called them “the last Negroes at Harvard” because presently the term “Negro” would be retired in favor of “black” and later “African-American.” I, too, was a member of the class of ’63. I am white.</td>

      <td>What begins with ‘anything goes’ ends with a new hierarchy.</td>
      <td>Nicole Ault’s op-ed “The ACLU Decides ‘Woman’ Is a Bad Word” (Oct. 4) is an excellent riposte to the latest attempt to gerrymander reality via politically driven manipulation of the English language. Her final comment about where this might stop is more than an abstract question about the range of possible identities. It has worrying political implications, too.<br />In a world where anyone can be whoever or whatever they feel, it is inevitable that some identities will stand in insufferable contradiction to others—the conservative Christian to that of the queer activist, for example. If society is to be at all coherent, this means that somebody is going to have to decide which identities are privileged and which are not.</td>
