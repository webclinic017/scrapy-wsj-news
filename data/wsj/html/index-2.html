      <td>Biden’s falsehoods show a misunderstanding of the continuing threat from Islamic terrorism.</td>
      <td>Cleaning up President Biden’s many false statements on Afghanistan is a difficult job, but someone in his Administration has to do it. On Sunday that task fell to Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the matter of al Qaeda’s presence in Afghanistan.<br />“Look, let’s put this thing in perspective here. What interest do we have in Afghanistan at this point with al Qaeda gone?” Mr. Biden said on Friday at the White House. “We went to Afghanistan for the express purpose of getting rid of al Qaeda in Afghanistan, as well as—as well as—getting Osama bin Laden. And we did.”<br />That wasn’t correct. A Pentagon spokesman acknowledged as much on Friday, and a recent United Nations report said al Qaeda was active in 15 of 34 Afghanistan provinces. On Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace put the question to Mr. Blinken: “Is al Qaeda gone from Pakistan—from Afghanistan?”<br />Mr. Blinken: “Al Qaeda’s capacity to do what it did on 9/11—to attack us, to attack our partners or allies from Afghanistan—is vastly, vastly diminished.”<br />Mr. Wallace: “Is it gone?”</td>

      <td>A ‘preclearance’ regime designed for Jim Crow is a poor fit in 2021 and probably unconstitutional.</td>
      <td>The Senate’s theatrical push this year for H.R.1, the bill to federalize U.S. elections, was intended as a political show, since it never had the votes to pass. Part of the point was to build pressure for Democrats’ next proposal, H.R.4, also called the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The text of H.R.4 was unveiled last week, and it also deserves to die when the House votes on it this week.<br />The bill’s biggest aim is to revive part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), which forced certain states and localities to get federal “preclearance” before altering election rules. The law helped to break Jim Crow in the South, but that was a different age. Preclearance was supposed to last five years. Congress has extended it to 2031, without revising the 1975 criteria that determined which states were covered.<br />This old formula is what the Supreme Court struck down in Shelby County v. Holder (2013). As Chief Justice John Roberts explained, black voter registration before the VRA was 6.4% in Mississippi. By 2004 it was 76.1%, higher than among whites. Black turnout in the most recent election, the Chief added, “exceeded white voter turnout in five of the six States originally covered.” The VRA’s formula, he said, bore “no logical relation to the present day.”<br />Without a valid way to establish where it applied, the VRA’s preclearance process went dormant. H.R.4 would resuscitate it, while greatly expanding its reach. Every jurisdiction in the country would need to be on guard, since H.R.4 says that some election changes would automatically need federal preclearance, nationwide. These include many voter-ID rules, along with new district lines and polling locations in certain areas with a substantial proportion of racial or linguistic minorities.<br />Preclearance would be required more broadly in any state where 15 “voting rights violations” occurred in the previous 25 years, with a lower threshold for smaller jurisdictions. What’s a “violation”? It includes prior rejections via the preclearance process. It also counts federal court rulings that found a breach of protected voting rights, plus some legal settlements to the same effect. Violations could be created if Democratic officials settled lawsuits brought by Democratic attorneys.</td>

      <td>Biden’s Aug. 31 deadline for evacuation is political and could leave many behind..</td>
      <td>The ugly, chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan continues despite Biden Administration attempts to spin it as a triumph of logistics and planning. More Americans and Afghans are getting out. But some have been beaten by the Taliban, and the pace is too slow for confidence or safety as President Biden’s Aug. 31 evacuation deadline nears.<br />The worst humiliation continues to be President Biden’s deference to the Taliban on how and when U.S. citizens and allies can get to the airport. So far he won’t let the Pentagon create corridors into Kabul city where the State Department last week told people to shelter in place, and as far as we know won’t send the military beyond Kabul so Americans around the country can find refuge and escape.<br />On  CBS ’s  “Face the Nation” on Sunday, host Major Garrett asked Secretary of State Antony Blinken: “Someone in our audience might listen to you, Mr. Secretary, and say, ‘Oh, so we have to ask the Taliban for permission for American citizens to leave.’ True or not true?”<br />Mr. Blinken replied: “They are in control of Kabul. That is the reality. That’s the reality that we have to deal with.”<br />Yes, but this isn’t the reality the U.S. has to accept. The U.S. military has more than enough force to dictate better terms to the Taliban, but the other reality is that Mr. Biden is too risk-averse to do it. Instead, the U.S. evacuates on the Taliban’s terms. Over the weekend the Taliban put the Haqqani network in charge of security in Kabul. In 2012 the U.S. designated the Haqqani network as a “foreign terrorist organization” because of its attacks on U.S. personnel and close ties to al Qaeda.</td>

      <td>The U.S. debacle in Afghanistan has rightly dominated the news, but the rest of the world keeps turning. China’s new five-year-plan for economic regulation in particular deserves more attention than it has received.<br />The document, formally the five-year plan for enhancing “rule of law,” should be read alongside the overarching five-year plan for the economy that Beijing unveiled in March. That program placed a renewed emphasis on manufacturing after many years when Beijing had said it wanted to boost services. President Xi Jinping’s government also played up “security” concerns. This mainly means looking askance at foreign influence, including imports and investment.<br />China’s Communist Party knows how to stick to a plan. Recent months have demonstrated with force what “de-emphasizing” services looks like. Authorities launched investigations of data practices at many internet firms. One target has been Didi, a popular ride-hailing app, which was instructed to stop taking new customers days after it raised $4.4 billion in an initial public offering in New York.<br />Beijing has since all but shut down the lucrative after-school tutoring market, may fine food-delivery app Meituan $1 billion for alleged antitrust violations, and is threatening the online gaming platform of Tencent, which is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange.<br />This month’s “rule of law” blueprint makes clear that these punishments will continue indefinitely. It calls several times for beefed-up antitrust enforcement, which in Meituan’s case is proving an effective vehicle for economic control. It contemplates legislation on national security and technological innovation, among other matters, and says Beijing will play a bigger role in regulating the development of industries such as internet finance, artificial intelligence and cloud computing.</td>

Economists expect to see a modest slowdown in the expansion of the services sector in both the U.S. and Europe and declines in activity in both Japan and Australia.<br />U.S. home prices hit a record in June amid a housing boom that is pitting low mortgage rates and strong demand against limited supplies of homes for sale. Economists are forecasting a small drop in existing-home sales in July, to an annual pace of 5.83 million from 5.86 million a month earlier, as price and supply constraints lock more would-be buyers out of the market.<br />U.S. jobless claims fell to a new pandemic low in the second week of August, a sign the labor market continues to improve despite rising Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations. Economists are forecasting little change in applications for unemployment benefits during the week ended Aug. 21, an outcome that would suggest layoffs are holding fairly steady as the summer unfolds.</td>

      <td>Evacuation effort continues amid chaos outside the Kabul airport, where U.S. forces are set up to stop potential attacks</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. warned that Islamic State poses a threat to Americans in Afghanistan as the Biden administration seeks to evacuate thousands of U.S. citizens and Afghan allies.<br />“The threat is real. It is acute. It is persistent. And it is something we are focused on with every tool in our arsenal,” Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s national security adviser, told CNN on Sunday when asked whether crowds at the Kabul international airport are vulnerable to terrorist attacks.<br />Mr. Sullivan said the U.S. military and intelligence community are working to stop potential attacks and to defend the airport. “We will do everything that we can for as long as we’re on the ground to keep that from happening. We are taking it absolutely deadly seriously,” he said.<br />The U.S. has sufficient resources on the ground to defend the airport, Mr. Sullivan added. Asked whether Mr. Biden would consider sending in more troops, Mr. Sullivan told NBC, “Every single day, the president asks his military commanders…whether they need additional resources, additional troops. So far, the answer has been no. But he will ask again today.”<br />The U.S. is continuing its massive evacuation effort in the country amid ongoing chaos outside the airport. The U.S. evacuated nearly 8,000 people from the country on about 60 flights over the 24-hour period through early Sunday morning, according to U.S. officials. More than 25,000 people have been evacuated since the airlift began on Aug. 14, the officials said.</td>

      <td>Lecturing and moral superiority aren’t working. Healthcare workers should try humility and respect.</td>
      <td>Mobile, Ala.<br />I practice medicine in an emerging Covid-19 hot spot in a state with one of the lowest vaccination rates. Last year I saw Covid at its worst when I deployed to New York to take care of patients in an overflow intensive-care unit. I am vaccinated. I wouldn’t say I “believe in science,” because science doesn’t work that way, but I trust the scientific process. Yet when it comes to trust and persuasion, the medical profession isn’t always winning the Covid-19 battle, and it’s worth understanding why.<br />The current attempts at persuading people to get the vaccine follow the typical trinity of persuasion put forth by Aristotle—logos, pathos and ethos. Social media and government platforms focus on data (logos), such as the stark disparities in serious illness between the vaccinated and the not. Then it turns into emotional pleas (pathos), with personal stories of lost patients or loved ones. Advocates talk about a moral duty of getting a vaccine (ethos).<br />But when the desired response doesn’t materialize—when a substantial portion of the country still refuses a shot—the calls devolve into histrionic and condescending pleas. Many people respond by digging in their heels. Plenty of research shows that once people make a decision and attach a strong moral identity to it, they ignore contrary data.<br />The medical community needs to confront the ugly reality of distrust, especially in my state. The Tuskegee Syphilis Study is a living memory. Between 1932 and 1972, government researchers actively withheld treatment for syphilis while promising free medical care, meals and burial insurance. Some reluctance in blindly trusting a new vaccine is understandable.</td>

      <td>The U.S. adopts, and in some ways exceeds, the high taxes and spending that have hurt the Continent.</td>
      <td>America is the land of “predatory capitalism,” German chancellor Helmut Schmidt liked to say. Most Europeans who celebrate social justice and the caring state would agree. But if the Europeans weren’t so leery of America, they would clap their hands in delight at the $3.5 trillion spending package and the $1.2 trillion infrastructure cornucopia working their way through Congress.<br />President Biden’s tax plans might soon make Europe look like a capitalist heaven by comparison. He wants to raise the long-term capital-gains tax from just below 24% to above 43%. Switzerland has no such tax. In Britain, inventor of the welfare state, it is 20% and in Germany 26%. On income tax, the U.S. may soon top the scale. Mr. Biden wants a top marginal income-tax rate of just below 40%. Add state and local income taxes, like California’s 13.3% for top earners, and wealthy U.S. taxpayers could pay more than their European counterparts.<br />The  New York Times  got it right: The Biden budget promises to “reshape the government’s role in the economy.” Don’t worry about the bill. A 10-year Treasury note nominally fetches about 1.25%, but at 5% inflation, the net yield falls below zero. Servicing a mountain of public debt with depreciating dollars is a steal. These days, profligacy is a virtue, not a vice. Why fret? It is a free ride, as long as central banks keep pumping no-cost money.<br />Somebody always pays. The laws of economics still apply. Why is inflation climbing on both sides of the Atlantic? The same adage: too much money chasing too few goods. Add the wage pressure caused by pernicious government programs pouring out the most generous income supports ever, and you get millions of unfilled jobs. Why look for a job if unearned money matches after-tax pay? It is a rational reflex, though it isn’t responsible.<br />The middle class will pay the bill. Inflation eats up savings, though the rich evade the trap by investing in assets like stocks, art and real estate, whose rising prices are rocketing past the inflation rate.</td>

      <td>Regimes that tried to rule from Kabul have always generated insurgencies in the countryside.</td>
      <td>Current and former political, military and intelligence officials are trying to pin responsibility for the catastrophe in Afghanistan on everyone but themselves. Some say what happened was inevitable. One retired senior military commander said we should have built the Afghan security forces to look more like the Taliban. President Biden blamed the Afghans as well as his predecessor. Such statements are infuriating. If these people knew that what has unfolded was inevitable and didn’t reassess and adjust policy and strategy accordingly, they are criminally negligent for sacrificing thousands of lives. If they were unaware that U.S. policy and strategy were not working, they are incompetent.<br />The fall of Afghanistan is, more than anything else, the result of U.S. political-military arrogance and incompetence at the senior levels over the past 20 years. Blaming the Afghans and claiming that only a political solution could bring peace are smoke screens. The administration’s assertion that the choice was between fighting the Afghan civil war or ending U.S. involvement is also nonsense and a false choice. Afghanistan could have been a success.<br />The Afghan failure is the result of a fundamental design flaw in U.S. Afghan policy that shaped the government in Kabul. Regimes that have tried to impose strong central authority from the capital have generated insurgencies against them. The presence of security forces composed of nonlocal troops periodically patrolling the countryside added to the instability because they were viewed as defenders of the central government rather than the local population. The policy left the countryside, where 70% of Afghans live, mostly unprotected from the Taliban. Yet the U.S. fell into this pattern, insisting on a government design contrary to the way rural Afghans understand governance and security. This was never a formula for stability; it was the cause of instability and of the growth and strength of the insurgency.<br />It was clear by 2005 that the U.S. approach wasn’t working. But rather than adjust, every administration either ignored the evidence or reinforced failure. The military continued to rotate units into the country as if Afghanistan were an extension of its National Training Centers. When “winning” was eliminated from America’s political-military list of acceptable terms, leaders focused on getting out with a veneer of honor.<br />This created a bizarre situation. The U.S. initiated peace talks directly with the Taliban, the enemy it removed from power almost 20 years ago. The Afghan government, America’s own creation, was excluded from the negotiations because the Taliban demanded it. The U.S. pressed the Afghan government to release thousands of Taliban prisoners as a good-faith gesture. American leaders have been oblivious to their culpability for the deteriorating situation and for undermining the will of the Afghan security forces.</td>

      <td>Biden’s Afghanistan bug-out got the priority backward.</td>
      <td>Joe Biden likes to end speeches by saying: “May God protect our troops”—perhaps a tribute to his late son Beau, who was awarded the Bronze Star for his yearlong military service in Iraq.<br />But the sentiment is wrongheaded, and the Afghan fiasco shows why. Perhaps sensing that point, Mr. Biden signed off last Monday’s and Friday’s addresses with a slight tweak: “May God protect our troops, our diplomats, and all of the brave Americans serving in harm’s way.” He still has it backward. Protecting troops’ lives is paramount, but their primary role is to defend America and its citizens.<br />In Afghanistan, we have a role reversal. Once the president decided to leave, the correct sequence would have been first to remove American civilians and Afghan allies from harm’s way, and only then order troops out. Instead, the mission seemed mostly designed to evacuate and protect troops, while diplomats, other “brave Americans,” and Afghans in distress became an afterthought.<br />Last week Mr. Biden ordered thousands of troops back in to secure Kabul’s airport. But Taliban fighters controlled the access roads, and the State Department sent a memo instructing Americans in the country that reaching the airport was their responsibility. As widely reported, armed Taliban at checkpoints used whips and guns to assure that only they have the authority to decide who reaches the airport. Travel documents, including of American citizens, were confiscated and ripped, leaving their holders with no means to leave. The sequence, again, is backward. The troops safeguarded the airport, where they are protected, while civilians were called on to brave the Taliban’s ire.<br />Is the American military capable of fighting the Taliban to create a safe passage for Americans and Afghans whose lives are endangered after decades of cooperating with America? Pentagon briefings give the impression that commanders on the ground believe such a mission is doable, even advisable. But the commander in chief needs to green-light such an operation, which may entail putting troops in harm’s way.</td>

Following the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, however, and a slew of regulations limiting the sale of ammunition, Coulombe decided to pull bullets from his shelves. Besides, there were other deals to be made—in wine, maple syrup, even Brie. The key was adaptability.<br />Actually, there are many keys to creating a thriving company, and Coulombe shares them all in “Becoming Trader Joe,” a memoir and how-to-succeed-in-business chronicle that appears posthumously.

Among other essentials: Be well informed (that is, read the fine print in leasing contracts); offer generous worker pay to reduce turnover (and deter unionization); and be wary of opening a store with access to a freeway. “Holdups are most common in stores which are closest to freeway on-ramps, because it’s easier to make a getaway.”<br />From 1967 to 1988, Coulombe ran Trader Joe’s, and ran it beautifully. Although he sold the company to the Albrecht family (of Aldi grocery-store fame) in 1979, it still bears the imprint of his original idea. “We went from leveraged to the gills in the early days to zero leverage by 1975,” he writes, adding that “we never lost money in a year, and each year was more profitable than the preceding year despite wild swings in the income tax rates.” Given such a record, any budding entrepreneur would do well to heed his advice, beginning with having a clarity of purpose.<br />“The fundamental job of a retailer is to buy goods whole, cut them into pieces, and sell the pieces to the ultimate consumers,” Coulombe writes. “This is the most important mental construct I can impart to those of you who want to enter retailing.” Of course, it’s not that simple—he describes the complexity of interstate-commerce laws, the strictures of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the ordeals of tax audits, and troubles he had with the United Farm Workers: Having picketers claim that Trader Joe’s was selling goods “full of piss and pesticide” distracted from that important mental construct.</td>

Best line: “America’s middle class is Cinderella, and the nation’s elites are her evil stepsisters.” OK then.<br />So who are they—the “sophisticated, vaccinated crowd” at the Obama birthday bash a New York Times reporter gushed about?

An American Illuminati? I keep looking. What I’ve discovered is that “elites” are mostly made-up groups everyone uses as punching bags of envy for whiny complaints.<br />A federal criminal filing notes that many Oath Keepers, a right-wing group, believe “government has been co-opted by a cabal of elites actively trying to strip American citizens of their rights.” Hillary Clinton wanted to collect “taxes in an equitable manner, especially from the elites.”<br />Ancient Rome had patricians and plebeians too. Look what happened to them. Same for Florence’s grandi, made famous by Machiavelli. The French foolishly funnel university elites into government. The Chinese Communist Party elites are now cracking down on their rich entrepreneurial elites. And the British still have hoity-toity duchesses and lords and knights and dames.</td>

      <td>JFK remade his decision-making process after the Bay of Pigs debacle. Biden could learn something.</td>
      <td>White House infighting can be a bad thing. But when advisers refuse to disagree with the president, an administration can be at risk of groupthink. The history of the U.S. presidency has shown that this can lead to disaster. We now see how fear of disagreement with President Biden doomed the decision-making process for the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.<br />The problem of groupthink was evident during the Vietnam War, when Lyndon B. Johnson was mostly intolerant of differing opinions on Vietnam. One adviser, George Ball, was designated as the in-house skeptic, but this role made Ball an outcast among his colleagues. As Johnson aide W. Marvin Watson wrote of Ball, “The arguments he expressed—always calmly but forcibly stated—were, to say the least, annoying to the President’s other advisors.”<br />And if you weren’t Ball, standing apart from Johnson on Vietnam was dangerous. Johnson maintained a narrow circle of advisers on Vietnam, dismissed internal dissenters, and berated those, like Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, who became more skeptical about the war over time.<br />Johnson called one McNamara proposal for a bombing halt in Vietnam “a load of s—.” He suspected McNamara was more loyal to “the Kennedys” than to him, and eventually Johnson dismissed him. Staffers who disagreed with Johnson’s Vietnam policy had to meet secretly in what they called the “nongroup” so he wouldn’t know about their conversations. Had Johnson sharpened his thinking with dissenting opinions, he might have reduced the 35,000 Americans who died in Vietnam on his watch, prevented the souring of U.S. public opinion on Vietnam, and stayed in office past 1969.<br />There is a historical example of an administration that fell into groupthink, saw the disastrous consequences, and righted the ship. The 1961 Bay of Pigs debacle occurred in part because no one among John F. Kennedy’s advisers was willing to play devil’s advocate. As the historian and Kennedy aide Arthur Schlesinger wrote of the decision to send poorly trained Cuban exiles to overthrow Fidel Castro, “our meetings were taking place in a curious atmosphere of assumed consensus, [and] not one spoke against it.”</td>

Among today’s great black public leaders, such as Robert Woodson Sr., Carol Swain, Glenn Loury, Jason Riley, John McWhorter, Thomas Sowell, the late Walter Williams, Ian Rowe and Shelby Steele among others, can be found an optimistic and grateful strain of thought on black agency, progress and life in America.<br />I had the privilege of hearing Mr. Woodson and Ms. Swain speak to a racially mixed audience. They noted how much improvement they’ve experienced in their lifetimes and their optimism for the future. Mr. Woodson characterizes his outlook as “radical grace,” encouraging his people to look ahead, not back, and to exercise agency for their personal and family success. “Things that are all black should not be seen as bad,” nor should black success depend on “what white people do or think of us,” he said. Ms. Swain noted that she was not raised to hate white people but to accept individuals as they come, and judge them likewise.

Hundreds of scientists volunteer time, producing the most intensively scrutinized expert review in the scientific world. They weigh all relevant studies to deliver a collective scientific judgment. This report assessed more than 14,000 scientific publications. It addressed over 78,000 scientific and public comments.<br />The product is the definitive word on climate science. The document is policy-relevant—not prescriptive—empowering governments to act, armed with the best possible knowledge.<br />The evidence is undeniable: Burning fossil fuels and deforestation are heating the Earth, making heat waves, heavy rainfall, droughts and fire weather more frequent and severe. The consequences of our failure to act are mounting and likely to worsen. This isn’t politics; it’s physics.<br />The Biden-Harris administration understands that scientific knowledge, free from politics, is paramount to a better future. Its leaders are taking aggressive action to reduce carbon pollution and the impacts of climate change in ways that bolster economic opportunity and create jobs. Obfuscating the world’s best science is a disservice to readers who depend on objective information to make independent assessments in the face of a changing planet.</td>

The FDA must weigh, among other things, the potential good of adult cigarette smokers switching to a less harmful option against the potential harm of young people getting hooked on nicotine.<br />The process already has eliminated some products from the market, and the agency has told e-cigarette makers to expect stricter controls on the way their products are marketed and sold. Some companies may be put out of business entirely. The FDA also could allow some sweet and fruity e-cigarette cartridges back on the market after temporarily restricting flavored vaping products last year.<br />“We are working furiously on application review in order to move on from sort of a Wild West unregulated marketplace,” the FDA’s acting commissioner, Janet Woodcock, said at a congressional hearing in June.  “We intend to use [our] authority to protect kids and optimize public health.”</td>

They are limiting the number of people with whom they socialize, wearing masks indoors again and avoiding inside dining.<br />Over the past year my reaction to Covid news from the U.S. has been one of astonishment. What struck me as odd about this article is that the measures are voluntary. In the U.S., significant numbers of people continue to insist they can do pretty much what they want. In Spain, where I have lived on and off for half a century, it is very different. Seventy percent of the population is vaccinated, and the percentage increases every week. Anti-vaxxers constitute a tiny minority. Virtually everyone still wears a mask outdoors, even though, as of June 26, it is no longer the law. Indoor diners take their masks off only once they are seated and the food is served. No bus driver or taxi driver will allow you to board unless you are masked.<br />This all began in March 2020 due to a drastic lockdown decree from the central government that almost everyone obeyed. People who didn’t were fined by police. Things are better now, and many of the restrictions have been eased or lifted. Nevertheless, most people continue to calmly follow the sorts of sensible protocols the physicians in the article recommend.<br />John J. Healey<br />Madrid</td>

      <td>Democratic leaders want to move two major bills in tandem, but some centrists are demanding the House first vote on infrastructure</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Centrist House Democrats were locked in a weekend standoff with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) over when to vote on a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill, imperiling the chamber’s ability to advance a sweeping segment of President Biden’s agenda in votes expected early this week.<br />A group of nine centrist Democrats has been at an impasse with Mrs. Pelosi and liberal Democrats for more than a week over a strategy to tie together the infrastructure bill, already passed with bipartisan support in the Senate, and Mr. Biden’s $3.5 trillion package of healthcare, education and climate provisions currently being crafted. That bill is expected to rely on just Democratic support under a process tied to the budget. To unlock that process, Mrs. Pelosi needs nearly all of her caucus on board for a procedural step planned for this week in the House.<br />“Any delay to passing the budget resolution threatens the timetable for delivering the historic progress and the transformative vision that Democrats share,” Mrs. Pelosi warned in a letter to House Democrats Saturday night.<br />The infrastructure and broader antipoverty bills are central to Mr. Biden’s domestic agenda, which he wants to keep on track after a chaotic week focused on the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. Democratic leaders months ago established a plan to move the two bills in tandem through both chambers of Congress. Their strategy gives both centrists—whose top priority is the infrastructure bill—and the liberal wing of the party—which is adamant about passing the broader package—some leverage in ensuring both bills get passed as Democrats hold each chamber by the narrowest of margins.<br />But earlier this month, the group of centrist Democrats balked at the plan and demanded that Mrs. Pelosi first bring the infrastructure bill to the House floor to swiftly pass it. Unless that happens, they threatened to oppose a budget framework, which is the first step in advancing the broader $3.5 trillion budget package and is expected to get a vote on the House floor Tuesday.</td>

A recount of a sample of ballots in Maricopa County found no issues. Two firms accredited by the federal U.S. Election Assistance Commission, considered the gold standard for the industry, tested Maricopa’s voting machines and said they passed.<br />As Mr. Trump continued to contest the results of the election and called on his supporters to do the same, Republicans in Arizona’s state Senate commissioned another review led by a Florida-based company called Cyber Ninjas Inc. No court or election authority has found evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election, and routine audits of paper ballots have confirmed the election outcomes in key states. Arizona’s election results were already certified, and this review won’t change them, state officials said.<br />The GOP-ordered review was expected to take two months but has stretched to four. Cyber Ninjas says it may complete the review this month.<br />Arizona Republicans who back the audit say it is necessary to show voters that they are taking election security seriously and that the 2022 elections will be fair.</td>

      <td>At first blush, small-cap stocks look like a bargain. But dig deeper and the story gets more complicated.<br />One common way to gauge whether a stock is looking expensive is to divide its price by the company’s earnings. By one measure, the Russell 2000 benchmark, whose members have an average market capitalization of about $3.3 billion, recently traded at about 19 times its past year’s earnings, while the large-cap Russell 1000 index traded at 25 times—making the small-cap segment seem like a deal.<br />However, when calculating the price-to-earnings ratio, analysts sometimes—as in the figures just cited—cut out the companies that don’t turn a profit. This can have a dramatic effect on how pricey a broad swath of the market appears, especially since the share of the small-cap index without profits, high to begin with, surged in the aftermath of the pandemic-induced recession.<br />For the Russell 2000 benchmark, leaving out the unprofitable companies means setting aside what for the past year has amounted to more than one third of the market value of the small-cap index, according to an analysis from Jefferies looking at earnings over the previous 12 months.<br />In comparison, only about 8% of the large-cap Russell 1000 index, whose members have an average market capitalization of about $511 billion, was made up of unprofitable companies at last count.</td>

      <td>Square’s deal for Afterpay has had a mixed effect on related stocks in payments and commerce, so investors can start hunting for relative bargains</td>
      <td>Square bet the future of “buy now, pay later” on Afterpay, acquiring it for $29 billion. Investors should spread their chips around.<br />The deal unleashed a flurry of buying not just in online checkout carts but in the stock market. Shares of other so-called BNPL players, including  Affirm Holdings  and Zip Co., jumped after the deal despite the fact that their giant competitor teamed up with Square. The thinking appeared to be that Square’s willingness to pay a premium for one of their peers shows that fears about installment payments becoming commoditized are overblown, and that the market is overall poised for huge growth.<br />Even if it seems counterintuitive, there are definitely reasons to hop on the bandwagon. BNPL providers don’t all do exactly the same thing: Affirm, for example, also offers larger, longer-term point-of-sale loans for bigger purchases. Overall, BNPL likely represents less than 3% of e-commerce globally, and about half of BNPL users recently surveyed had used more than one service, according to payments research firm the Strawhecker Group. So there is likely room for volumes to continue to grow sharply. Plus, based on the multiple of forward sales for which Afterpay was acquired, even at a relative discount Affirm could still plausibly trade well over $70 per share, according to Autonomous Research analyst Rob Wildhack—several dollars above where it is now.<br />There might also be some attractive trades elsewhere. For one,  PayPal Holdings  has slipped this month. Yet PayPal also offers installments via its payment button and in some ways competes with Square to provide payment services to merchants. But PayPal’s installments work within its wallet already, so it doesn’t even necessarily require additional merchant buy-in to drive volumes still higher. If consumer awareness of BNPL grows broadly, PayPal would very likely be a beneficiary.<br />Another sometimes-competitor to Square for merchants,  Shopify ,  is also down in August. Here too, Shopify would also likely be lifted by a rising tide of BNPL as it offers installments via its Shop Pay service. Notably, Affirm is its partner for the types of smaller, shorter-term installments that compete with what Afterpay does.</td>

And even if it does, the country needs a lot more of it.<br />Those are a couple of the arguments being heard in Tokyo as the rich world’s most-indebted government relative to its size prepares for a new round of spending this fall that could reach into the hundreds of billions of dollars.<br />Japan often serves as a tryout venue for policies that later debut on the world economy’s biggest stage, the U.S. The Japanese central bank was a pioneer in introducing zero interest rates and buying large quantities of government bonds to stimulate a sluggish economy, tools subsequently used by the Federal Reserve.<br />In debt as well, Japan has led the pack. Its central-government debt first surpassed the size of the economy about 20 years ago. Now the U.S. is crossing that threshold too, and Congress is debating trillions of dollars more in proposed spending.<br />Tokyo’s central government is already on the hook to pay out nearly $10 trillion to its creditors.

It’s the first to run Google’s revamped software for wearables, Wear OS 3. That means the Watch4 can run native Google services, such as Google Maps and Google Pay, and download watch apps from the Google Play store.<br />The partnership between Google and Samsung makes sense. Samsung is eager to catch up to Apple, the longtime smartwatch leader. The most recent estimates indicate that the Apple Watch maker has captured 33% of the global market, according to Counterpoint Research. Samsung accounts for just 8% of smartwatches, while Fitbit has 4.5% world-wide.<br />Previous Galaxy Watch models were powered by Tizen, a Samsung-designed operating system. Google couldn’t get Wear OS to take off with other smartwatch makers. The result? A confusing software ecosystem, with developers shrugging their shoulders and not really supporting many apps for either. Google says by merging platforms with Samsung, the joint effort also sped up app loading times and lengthened battery life.</td>

      <td>Is the Fed more concerned about battling inflation or helping the economy?</td>
      <td>Three vital issues for investors remain uncertain as the Federal Reserve moves toward tapering its bond buying. Will this quantitative tightening mean Treasury yields go up or down? Will stocks do better with rising or falling bond yields? And, a linked issue, is the stock-bond relationship that has held for the past three decades going into reverse?<br />Few people share my first uncertainty, because it seems so obvious that if the Fed buys fewer Treasurys, the price will drop and hence the yield rise. It is basic supply and demand, goes the response: Duh.<br />It is certainly true that all else equal, fewer bond purchases should mean a higher yield. But all else isn’t equal, because the Fed’s discussion of withdrawing stimulus shows a shift in mentality toward tighter monetary policy. Tighter monetary policy means less growth and inflation in the long run, and so lower long-term bond yields. The balance between the demand impact of less Fed buying and the perception of policy tightening will determine whether 10-year yields rise or fall, and it isn’t obvious to me which way they will go.<br />Wednesday and Thursday of last week provided an early test, as stocks and commodity prices dropped around the world after Fed minutes showed the central bank shifting toward tapering bond-buying this year. After briefly rising, 10-year yields dropped back.<br />The market’s early moves also provide a guide on the second uncertainty: Ending Fed bond-buying might be bad for stocks. We should be cautious about how bad, though, because of the uncertain interplay of two forces. Tighter monetary policy itself is bad for stocks, but the stronger growth that usually pushes the Fed to tighten is good for stocks. Since about 2000 this has shown up in a strong short-term correlation between rising yields and rising stock prices (despite the fact that over periods of years stocks have risen and yields fallen).</td>

Without outside support or access to a border with a friendly nation, the anti-Taliban militias would find it difficult to hold out for long.</td>

      <td>With the latest wave of return-to-office delays from Covid-19, some companies are considering a new possibility: Offices may be closed for nearly two years.<br />That is raising concerns among executives that the longer people stay at home, the harder or more disruptive it could be to eventually bring them back.<br />Many employees developed new routines during the pandemic, swapping commuting for exercise or blocking hours for uninterrupted work. Even staffers who once bristled at doing their jobs outside of an office have come to embrace the flexibility and productivity of at-home life over the past 18 months, many say. Surveys have shown that enthusiasm for remote work has only increased as the pandemic has stretched on.<br />“If you have a little blip, people go back to the old way. Well, this ain’t a blip,” said Pat Gelsinger, chief executive officer of  Intel Corp. , whose company has benefited from the work-from-home boom. He predicts hybrid and remote work will remain the norm for months and years to come. “There is no going back.”<br />Return dates have been postponed repeatedly. On Thursday, Apple Inc. told corporate employees that its planned return to U.S. offices would be delayed until at least January. Companies such as  Chevron Corp.  and  Wells Fargo  & Co. have postponed September returns, while tech companies such as  Amazon.com Inc.  and  Facebook Inc.  have pushed them to early next year.  Lyft Inc.  said it would call employees back to its San Francisco headquarters in February, about 23 months after the ride-sharing company first closed its offices.</td>

      <td>The bipartisan infrastructure bill approved by the Senate this month is the latest in a series of extraordinary infusions of federal money into public transit agencies. But all that money likely won’t buy what transit really needs: more riders.<br />Unless ridership recovers from its pandemic-induced drop, agencies will again confront large budget deficits once the federal money runs out in three or four years, analysts say. That could mean service cuts and fare increases, according to transit agencies.<br />“As soon as the money stops flowing, transit agencies are going to be in the same position as they were before,” said Baruch Feigenbaum, a transportation policy expert at the libertarian-leaning Reason Foundation.<br />New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority, for instance, expects to use up its $14.5 billion allocation of federal aid by 2024, at which point it will face a $3.5 billion two-year shortfall.<br />Transit ridership nationwide fell by 78% between February and April 2020 as the rise in Covid-19 cases prompted people to stay home. Agencies pared back their services but still lost crucial revenue. Fares account for about a third of operating costs, according to the Transportation Department.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is planning a dramatic ramp-up of its airlift from Kabul by making preparations to compel major U.S. airlines to help with the transportation of tens of thousands of evacuees from Afghanistan, while expanding the number of U.S. military bases that could house Afghans.<br />The White House is expected to consider activating the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, or CRAF, created in 1952 in the wake of the post-World War II Berlin Airlift, to provide nearly 20 commercial jets from up to five airlines to augment U.S. military efforts to transport Afghan evacuees from bases in the region, according to U.S. officials.<br />The civilian planes wouldn’t fly in or out of Kabul, which fell to Taliban rule Aug. 15, officials said. Instead, commercial airline pilots and crews would help to ferry the thousands of Afghans and others who are stranded at U.S. bases in Qatar, Bahrain and Germany.<br />The involvement of the commercial airliners would relieve the pressure on those bases, which are fast filling up with Afghan evacuees as the U.S. expands efforts to fly them out of the airport in Kabul. Thousands of Afghans at risk of retaliation from the Taliban because of their association with U.S. forces have flooded the airport in the past week.<br />The U.S. Transportation Command, part of the military, has provided an initial notification to airlines that they may be told to implement the reserve fleet, the U.S. officials said. White House, Pentagon and Commerce officials hadn’t yet issued final approvals for its use, and alternative options still could be instituted, the officials said. The possible use of CRAF hasn’t been previously reported.</td>

By Friday morning, the Journal said it facilitated the safe passage of its Afghanistan colleagues and their families, evacuating 76 people to Qatar; the last four remained in the airport in Kabul awaiting a promised flight for three days.<br />Those four people were in the air en route to Ukraine on Saturday, according to Journal Managing Editor Karen Pensiero.<br />The New York Times and Washington Post said earlier this week those two news organizations successfully evacuated colleagues and their families from Afghanistan.<br />The Biden administration said earlier this week that Kabul’s international airport was open for military and commercial flights, but thousands of people trying to leave Afghanistan still struggled to get to the airport in the capital city. By Friday, the perimeter of Kabul’s airport remained engulfed in chaos, with troops firing tear gas to control desperate crowds.</td>

      <td>Research shows that we are overconfident in our beliefs but underconfident about being heard. So we compensate by being loud.</td>
      <td>There is a lot of shouting in today’s discourse, from both sides of the political spectrum. Shouting matches have erupted on the House floor between Democrats and Republicans over individual Congress members’ vaccination status and in school board meetings over critical race theory and masking requirements.<br />It’s clear that shouting doesn’t actually persuade anyone. So then, why do we do it? Recent research points to a surprising answer: lack of confidence.<br />As a social psychologist I’ve studied the misperceptions people have about influence for more than 15 years, and I’ve seen that while we often are overconfident in our beliefs, the tendency to shout—whether over our neighbors, friends or adversaries—comes from underconfidence in our ability to convince others.<br />For a long time, it seemed as if researchers were constantly uncovering new ways in which people were overconfident. For example, in 2002 a team of Stanford researchers reported in the journal “Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin” on three surveys in which participants rated themselves as less susceptible to bias than their peers or than “average Americans.” In one follow-up, respondents stood by their assertion even after hearing an explanation of how their own view of themselves could be biased.<br />Using similar methods, researchers have found that the average person thinks of himself or herself as better in myriad ways (more moral, creative, athletic, even a better driver) than the average person—a statistical impossibility.</td>

      <td>Extremely weird Crocs, Yeezys, Nikes and Balenciaga sneakers were only the beginning. Shoes keep getting more casual—and more unsightly. Here, a unisex guide to the bizarre kicks that are growing more popular each season.</td>
      <td>IN THE SHOE market, weirdness has won. Take a spin through a department store’s footwear floor and you’ll find a buffet of bizarre high-fashion shoes like a Bottega Veneta women’s $1,250 blocky wedge heel with red, chicken pox-like specks or J.W. Anderson’s unisex $645 leather mule with a gigundo Mr. T-esque gold chain across the front.<br />It’s not only high-end designers that have come down with a case of the weirds. Approachable retailer Zappos.com offers $65 platform  Crocs  in a zesty zebra print and $120 clementine-orange, hefty-soled Hoka One One running shoes. “There is a real appetite for color, pattern and interesting fabrication,” said Catherine Newell-Hanson, the site’s style director. Shoes, she continued, have become “a safe space for people to play around with a more outlandish expression of personal style than they might in the rest of [their] outfit.”<br />There are precursors to this trend—like Margiela’s cloven Tabi boots, which debuted in 1988—but the weird-is-good movement has truly erupted over the past half-decade. It’s been gaining ground in the pandemic, as WFH freedom to experiment away from co-workers’ critical eyes has coincided with a drive toward comfort at any cost. In 2017, the launch of Balenciaga’s bulbous, pre-weathered Triple S sneakers set a new standard for intentionally ugly designer shoes. Meanwhile, frumpy Crocs and Birkenstocks were being recontextualized as beloved, even covetable, shoes, a trend spurred by collaborations with stars like Justin Bieber and luxury brands like Jil Sander, respectively.<br />The forces of casualization have made office footwear like shiny dress shoes and chaste heels—once a crucial adult investment—increasingly irrelevant. It’s now acceptable to wear startlingly informal shoes daily. “The more outrageous [the shoe], the better,” said Jessica Pridgen, 37, a graphic designer in Raleigh, N.C. She owns a multitude of statement shoes including Bottega Veneta boots with a globular toe and stacked-sole  Nike  sneakers made in collaboration with Japanese label Sacai.<br />The pandemic accelerated the trend, said Ms. Newell-Hanson of Zappos. Free from the strictures of an office, work-from-homers began purchasing diverting shoes. It’s hard not to smile (or smirk) at a pair of wacky tie-dye Crocs or furry purple Marni mules. Who didn’t need that his year? And when your only daily excursion is a brisk dog-walk or an efficient march though the grocery store, function trumps formality: All you really need is doughy gray New Balances or springy Keen mules.</td>

It was also part of a campaign by Mr. Karzai that he says is aimed at preventing fighting and negotiating some kind of power-sharing agreement between the Taliban and other Afghan political forces. For the past two years, Mr. Karzai has sought to put himself at the center of such efforts.<br />Last Sunday, he said he was forming a three-person “coordination council” to secure a peaceful transfer of power along with Abdullah Abdullah, the head of the former Afghan government’s peace delegation, and the veteran Islamist warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.</td>

The decision by wire-transfer services  Western Union Co.  and  MoneyGram International Inc.  to stop doing business in Afghanistan restricts the flow of overseas payments that are a key source of support for many Afghan families.<br />Earlier guidance by the world’s terror-finance watchdog organization, the Financial Action Task Force, warned member countries they must freeze the assets of the Taliban given the Taliban’s designation as a terrorist group by the U.S., the United Nations and other countries, “and to ensure that no funds or other assets are made available, directly or indirectly” to them.<br />With the Taliban seizing key cities in recent weeks, including the capital, Kabul, last weekend, and taking control of institutions of state, markets and key industries, finance officials say they are concerned that the sanctions will apply to a much broader array of transactions, including payments to Afghan entities via the country’s commercial banks.</td>

      <td>As first-year college students head to campus this fall, they’ll be making a big leap toward independence from their parents. Or will they?<br />Many parents have a hard time letting go, especially in recent times. And with apps that can track their kids’ every move, they don’t have to let go anymore. Parents can maintain a digital tether indicating whether their kids are partying at a frat house or studying at the library, how fast they’re driving and even if their phone battery is running low.<br />The decision of whether to track college kids—through apps such as Life360 or a smartphone’s location-sharing settings—is polarizing. There’s the camp that believes tracking kids keeps them safe, allowing parents to send help when their children have been in car accidents or to guide them when they’ve gotten lost. And then there’s the camp that says it offers parents a false sense of security while stifling kids’ development.<br />Lupe Ruiz-Catala, a mother of two in Bergenfield, N.J., began using Life360 to keep tabs on her daughter, Victoria Catala, when she went to college. Victoria went to Greece her first semester of freshman year as part of a study-abroad program, and her mom freaked out. “I was sick to my stomach,” Ms. Ruiz-Catala recalls. “How would I keep her safe other than move to Greece with her?”<br />Ms. Ruiz-Catala looked into a number of apps but decided on Life360—a leader in the category, with more than 32 million monthly active users—because it could show her daughter’s location on a map, track how fast she was going in a car and report when her phone battery was low—which it frequently was.</td>

      <td>Ruling to ban mega ships from lagoon splits a city reliant on foreign visitors</td>
      <td>VENICE—Gianluigi Rizo, a porter at Venice’s iconic Piazza San Marco, pushes a cart of luggage as scores of tourists hop off water taxis, coming in from the airport through the medieval city’s canals.<br />Business is picking up as Covid-19 restrictions are lifted. But a ruling last month by the Italian government to ban cruise ships from approaching Venice’s lagoon is threatening to deprive the city of its most lucrative visitors for another summer season.<br />“It’s good that tourists are back, but the real money comes from the cruise ships with the Americans and the well-off Asians,” Mr. Rizo said. “They spend big in a short time, before sailing out.”<br />Venice, which averaged around 20 million tourists a year before the pandemic, is desperate to bring back the foreign visitors that keep its economy afloat. Tourism revenue dried up over the past two years, but the city’s canals and piazzas are busy again and hotels are 80% full on average in August.<br />Access to the lagoon and Piazza San Marco has for years been a bone of contention between environmental campaigners, tourism bodies and cruise operators. Critics argue that runaway tourism—fed by the massive ships that move more than 5,000 passengers each—has pushed out many of Venice’s permanent residents, put a strain on housing and destroyed jobs not related to travel and hospitality. Tensions heightened in 2019 when a cruise ship crashed into a small tourist boat inside the lagoon, injuring five people.</td>

Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management together invested $2.75 billion into Melvin’s hedge fund on Jan. 25 as Melvin was hemorrhaging money. In return for the rare intra-month investments, the two firms received non-controlling revenue shares in Melvin for three years. The arrangement means they share in the management and performance fees Melvin collects from its clients over that time but don’t get any control over Melvin or its investments.<br />Citadel will keep its revenue share, some of the people familiar with the matter said. It couldn’t be determined Friday if Citadel plans to redeem additional money later, but a person familiar with Citadel said it expected to remain a large investor.<br />Founded by Gabe Plotkin, a former star portfolio manager for Mr. Cohen, Melvin had been one of the best-performing hedge funds in recent years until the meme-stock misadventure in January upended its portfolio. Individual investors banding together on forums like Reddit and Discord claimed victory for driving up shares of GameStop and other companies. Some hedge funds profited from the unprecedented market moves. Melvin lost 54.5%, or more than $6 billion, in just a few weeks.<br />The dizzying ascent of a handful of stocks, plus mounting losses at Melvin and other prominent hedge funds including Point72 and D1 Capital Partners, transfixed Wall Street and individual investors and sparked a congressional hearing, regulatory inquiries and federal probes.</td>

      <td>Regulator tries to balance individual benefits with those to society</td>
      <td>LONDON—The U.K.’s Covid-19 vaccination campaign has been one of the fastest in the world. But when it comes to teenagers, it is going slowly.<br />The U.K.’s decision to extend vaccination to all older teenagers only this month leaves it trailing the U.S. and many other Western countries in giving shots to younger age groups.<br />Though they rarely get seriously ill, young people can harbor the virus and transmit it to adults, potentially seeding further surges of infections—a possibility heightened by the extreme transmissibility of the Delta variant now dominant in the country.<br />This may present a risk as schools and colleges reopen in the fall, some disease experts say, though there is a debate among scientists about the scale of that risk in places like the U.K., where a large majority of adults are vaccinated.<br />The U.K. has vaccinated nearly 90% of adults with at least one dose, and over three-quarters with two, compared with 72% and 62% in the U.S., respectively. But nearly 17% of under-18s in the U.S. have been vaccinated with at least their first shot, compared with 2% in the U.K.</td>

      <td>Migrant arrests are hitting records, but many who are intercepted are sent to Mexico while those who stay are often tested for the virus</td>
      <td>As the rate of Covid-19 infections rises across the U.S., some policy makers have said that the surge in illegal crossings at the southern border is contributing to the pandemic.<br />Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has cited the federal policy of allowing some asylum-seeking migrants to enter the U.S. as a reason for the wave of Delta-variant cases in his state. He said in a Fox News interview in July that President Biden, a Democrat, is “importing Covid into Texas and the United States.”<br />Such concerns have raised questions about how many migrants are allowed to stay in the country after crossing the border and how they are handled when it comes to health policies for limiting the spread of the deadly virus.<br />It depends who they are. Generally, single adults and some families are immediately returned to Mexico under a public-health policy known as Title 42, while children who arrive at the border without a parent are permitted to stay. Of the nearly 1.3 million arrests made by the Border Patrol so far this budget year, which began in October, 66% resulted in the person being sent back to Mexico immediately.<br />Families who aren’t immediately turned away under Title 42 are instead allowed to pursue their immigration claims in the U.S., where federal law permits anyone to apply for asylum regardless of how they entered the country. The most recent government data show that 87% of families who crossed the border in July were given this option. The Border Patrol typically releases them with a court date or an appointment to check in with immigration authorities, and migrants most often then travel to different parts of the U.S. to join family members or friends.</td>

Clients can be anonymous too, generally acting through lawyers. Most investigations never become public.<br />Some of the text detectives say part of their work is pro bono and driven by a desire to defend ethical standards in publishing. Their targets include authors of nonfiction books, newspaper or journal articles and—in Germany, where Ph.D.s are common among politicians—dissertations.</td>

      <td>Lew Seok-choon’s comments about World War II-era sex slaves led to defamation charges and put him at the center of controversy over classroom speech</td>
      <td>SEOUL—Deep into a three-hour sociology class, a South Korean professor offered a controversial view of women in Japan’s World War II-era military brothels. They weren’t taken forcefully by the Japanese military. The work was “a form of prostitution,” the professor said, according to a 2019 transcript of his remarks.<br />Those words cost professor Lew Seok-choon his job, got him indicted and have now made him an avatar in the global debate about academic freedom on college campuses.<br />A recording of the comments, made two years ago in the first class of the fall semester at Seoul’s Yonsei University, became public after a student leaked the audio to local press on the day of the lecture. The school blocked Mr. Lew, now 66 years old, from teaching the course during his final year before retirement. Prosecutors last year charged him with three counts of defamation. The case remains ongoing.<br />Among the list of grievances between Tokyo and Seoul, none carries as much emotional charge in South Korea as “comfort women” who were forced into sex slavery by Japan. To many Koreans, the matter remains unresolved and serves as a painful reminder of Japan’s 35-year colonial rule. It endures as a central point of tension between the two countries, unfolding in diplomacy, at protests and in forced-labor lawsuits.<br />The Japanese government has acknowledged its military was involved in the “comfort women” system and issued formal apologies. Tokyo’s disagreement on the matter now with Seoul largely revolves around whether the government bears any legal liability—which it denies, citing prior accords with Seoul. The United Nations, as far back as 1996, has published reports describing the comfort-women system as sexual slavery.</td>

      <td>The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum reunites six works, based on Ovid’s ‘Metamorphoses,’ that the Renaissance master created for Philip II.</td>
      <td>Boston<br />Between 1551 and 1562, Tiziano Vecelli (about 1488-1576)—Titian—the most famous artist in Europe, painted six canvases of mythological subjects for Philip II, king of Spain, the world’s most powerful ruler. Based on tales of the loves, caprices and vengeance of the gods recounted in Ovid’s “Metamorphoses,” the paintings are known as poesie—painted poetry—familiar stories reinvented as complex visual narratives full of voluptuous flesh, sumptuous textures and evocative landscapes. (The very Catholic ruler also commissioned religious subjects from Titian.) Installed together in the Alcázar toward the end of the 16th century, after Philip moved his court to Madrid, then dispersed, the paintings are reunited in “Titian: Women, Myth & Power” at Boston’s Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, jointly organized by the Gardner, the National Gallery (London), National Galleries of Scotland, and Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid. Seen earlier in Europe, the Gardner’s exhibition includes works that have never before traveled to the U.S. We’ll never see the poesie this way again.<br />Fortuitously, the Boston showing coincides with the 125th anniversary of Isabella Stewart Gardner’s acquisition of the magnificent “Rape of Europa” (1559-62)—the last of the series executed, probably the most important Renaissance painting in the U.S., and, it seems, the poesia Titian was most pleased with. Its gorgeous color radiant after recent cleaning, at eye level instead of its usual elevation, “Europa” dominates a gathering of some of the most glorious works produced in 16th-century Venice, beautifully installed by the Gardner’s curator Nathaniel Silver, one of the international organizers of the show and a contributor to the excellent catalog.<br />Taking his cue from Titian’s surviving letters to Philip and the paintings’ visual relationships, Mr. Silver arranged the poesie in pairs. The first painting completed, “Danaë” (c. 1551-53), a reclining nude facing forward, ravished by Jupiter as a shower of gold, is joined by “Venus and Adonis” (c. 1553-54), a seated nude seen from the back, as she struggles to keep her lover from going hunting. Actaeon’s accidental encounter with Diana, goddess of the hunt, bathing with her chaste retinue (1556-59), flanks Diana’s discovery of the nymph Callisto’s pregnancy after Jupiter had his way with her (1556-59). (See “Danaë.”) The two marine subjects are side by side: Perseus rescuing Andromeda—nude, vertical, chained to a rock—from a sea monster (c. 1554-56), and Jupiter, disguised as a white bull, swimming off to Crete with Europa—scantily clad and precariously horizontal on the bull’s back.<br />The poesie, which could be described as thought transubstantiated into resplendent color, gesture and touch, asserted that painting, far from being manual labor or craft, was an intellectual pursuit, like poetry—a lingering debate during Titian’s lifetime. Titian used Ovid’s stories as points of departure, reinventing entire narratives as single images. Actaeon gazes at a stag’s skull and drying deerskins, prefiguring his being turned into a stag and torn to pieces by his hounds as punishment for seeing Diana unclothed. Europa’s companions and the herd that Jupiter joined as a white bull are on the distant shore, providing the back story to her abduction. Perseus (the son of Danaë and Jupiter, to keep it all in the family) swoops in, his pose echoing with the spiraling putti in “Europa”; branches of coral at Andromeda’s feet remind us that he slew the Gorgon Medusa and that drops of blood from her severed head created coral.</td>

      <td>The Covid-19 vaccine maker’s shares are the top performer in the S&P 500 so far this year, but some analysts question the rally</td>
      <td>Shares of  Moderna Inc.  have been on a tear lately, making the Covid-19 vaccine-maker the top performer in the S&P 500 this year.<br />Cambridge, Mass.-based Moderna’s stock price has surged 267% in 2021, handily trouncing all other companies in the benchmark index. Retailer  Bath & Body Works Inc.,  recently rebranded from L Brands Inc., follows in a distant second, with a 120% year-to-date gain. Only two other companies in the S&P 500—steel producer Nucor Corp. and cybersecurity stock  Fortinet Inc. —have, based on Friday’s closing prices, seen their stock double this year.<br />The vaccine maker’s outperformance is the latest win for Moderna. The company, which before the pandemic had yet to commercialize a product, has reported roughly $5.9 billion in Covid-19 vaccine sales in the first half of the year. It has already signed $12 billion in advanced purchase agreements—with an additional $8 billion in options—for its coronavirus vaccine next year. Meanwhile, the stock is being embraced by both professional and individual investors, who together drove the stock as high as $497.49 intraday, an all-time-high, this month. It closed Friday at nearly $383.<br />That combination has vaulted Moderna to a more than $150 billion market capitalization, down from its peak of roughly $200 billion intraday earlier this month. Still, Moderna’s current market cap ranks it higher than pharmaceutical powerhouses  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.  and  GlaxoSmithKline  PLC, as well as retail pharmacy chain  CVS Health Corp.<br />Few analysts and investors predicted that Moderna, a company founded just over a decade ago, could have found success—or swelled to its current market cap—as quickly as it did. Even at the end of last year, after its Covid-19 vaccine received emergency use authorization in the U.S., many questioned whether the stock would continue to rise after it already surged 434% in 2020.</td>

      <td>Many who started careers during the pandemic have never worked in the same space as colleagues. But there are ways bosses can ensure they don’t miss out on mentoring.</td>
      <td>More than a year into the great remote-work experiment, a new breed of young professionals has emerged: those who have never worked in an office.<br />Workers like 20-year-old Matt Franchi are joining their ranks every day as the Delta variant delays many office-reopening plans. Mr. Franchi secured a software-engineering job in July after graduating from Clemson University and was all set to move to Washington, where his new employer has an office. But with Covid-19 cases climbing again, the company told him a few weeks ago that his position would be remote for the foreseeable future.<br />“I was looking forward to the move, because D.C. seems more diverse and there’s a lot more going on,” says Mr. Franchi, who started work this month—from his childhood bedroom in Summerville, S.C. “Now, I’m not sure if I’ll ever make it to D.C.”<br />Some young workers are disappointed they have yet to experience working side-by-side with colleagues and the spontaneous collaboration and coaching that can come from being in the same space. Others say they have gotten accustomed to the virtual world and don’t feel they are missing much. Regardless, some workplace and management experts say that missing out on an office experience so early in a career may hurt mentorship prospects and the development of interpersonal office skills, and that managers should make an extra effort to offset those risks.<br />“Young workers need those close relationships, people to vent to, and mentor figures more than older ones,” says Eddy Ng, a management professor at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, who conducted a survey last summer of 424 people working remotely after the pandemic’s outbreak. Of those over 40, 45% said they preferred to continue working remotely after the pandemic, compared with 30% of those under 40. Among the younger set, he says, “there’s an element of FOMO,” or fear of missing out.</td>

The company also identified a further 667,000 former clients who had some personal information compromised.<br />T-Mobile also said the hack accessed IMEI and IMSI data—serial numbers tied to phones—from current customers.

The average account covers more than one phone line.<br />Security researchers said the phone-specific serial numbers, when paired with other personal information, could prove particularly damaging in the hands of criminals who use the data to commit fraud. Attackers with information about a person’s subscriber identity module, or SIM, can use the information to impersonate a victim and take over his or her phone line.<br />“Our investigation is ongoing and will continue for some time, but at this point, we are confident that we have closed off the access and egress points the bad actor used in the attack,” the company said.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration asked the Supreme Court on Friday to block lower-court orders to reinstate a Trump-era policy that requires asylum applicants to remain in Mexico while their claims are evaluated by U.S. authorities.<br />The lower-court decision “imposes a severe and unwarranted burden on Executive authority over immigration policy and foreign affairs by ordering the government to precipitously re-implement a discretionary program that the Secretary [of Homeland Security] has determined was critically flawed,” the Justice Department filing said.<br />The administration said the order effectively required the Remain in Mexico policy, formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, to operate indefinitely, because it would terminate only when the government had capacity to detain all asylum applicants in the U.S.—something that Congress never has provided funding to accomplish.<br />President Biden canceled Remain in Mexico, responding to criticism that it forced vulnerable migrants to wait out their cases in violent border cities. As a practical matter, Remain in Mexico hasn’t been in use since 2019. Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, U.S. officials under both the Trump and Biden administrations have been turning back migrants under public-health orders issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />The Republican-controlled states of Texas and Missouri in April sued the Biden administration, arguing that canceling the Remain in Mexico program would impose costs on their taxpayers, for instance by requiring motor-vehicle departments to process driver’s license applications for noncitizens who moved in while their cases were pending. It can take months or years to resolve asylum claims before U.S. immigration courts.</td>

      <td>Thirty years ago, police held back while roving bands attacked Jews in a Brooklyn neighborhood.</td>
      <td>“The most serious anti-Semitic incident in American history,” as historian Edward S. Shapiro describes it, took place precisely 30 years ago when a mob took over the streets of Crown Heights, a neighborhood in Brooklyn, N.Y. Rioters killed one Orthodox Jew and beat dozens. Thousands were forced into hiding while windows shattered, police watched and Mayor David Dinkins stayed aloof. Members of the crowd shouted “Hitler should have finished the job” and “Death to the Jews.” Yet then as now, many liberals hesitated to pass judgment.<br />The Lubavitch Orthodox Jewish population has been growing in Crown Heights since 1940, but the neighborhood around it has changed. In 1960 Crown Heights was 71% white and 27% black. By 1970 the numbers had flipped. By 1990 it was around 80% black, including a large Caribbean-American population.<br />What happened is no mystery. As Jimmy Breslin wrote in 1993, “in all of America, wherever a large group of blacks settle, every white in sight flees.” Irish, Italians and other Jews left Crown Heights. But “the Lubavitchers do not run,” Breslin wrote. “These people in hats and beards are better than any other whites because they stayed and everybody else ran.” They might not have marched for civil rights in Selma, Ala., but neither did they decamp to the suburbs.<br />On the night of Monday, Aug. 19, 1991, the Lubavitcher rebbe was returning home from a visit to a cemetery. His motorcade’s third and final car, driven by Yosef Lifsh, had fallen behind and sped to catch up. Either running a red light or making a yellow one, his car collided with another at a Crown Heights intersection. It veered onto the sidewalk and struck 7-year-old cousins Gavin and Angela Cato. Gavin was killed, Angela seriously injured.<br />Mr. Lifsh got out and attempted to help, but a crowd began to beat him and his passengers. Nearby police struggled to control the situation until two ambulances arrived, one from Hatzalah, a volunteer Orthodox Jewish organization, and one from the city. Thinking quickly, officers ordered Hatzalah to take the injured Lubavitchers, while city medics attended to the children. That launched a rumor that the Jewish ambulance service had cared only about Jews and left Gavin Cato to die.</td>

It’s also good that 18,000 people have been evacuated since the Taliban took control of the capital. But the U.S. still doesn’t know how many Americans are in the country, and the U.S. Embassy warned this week that “the United States government cannot ensure safe passage to the Hamid Karzai International Airport.”<br />Mr. Biden said Friday that “we’re in constant contact with the Taliban,” who he says are letting Americans with passports through their checkpoints. But it’s distressing to hear a Commander in Chief admit that he’s relying on the promises of jihadists who have spent years killing Americans. Mr. Biden even suggested they’ll let Americans pass because, well, they need to make a good impression on the world community. Lovely.<br />The situation is worse for the thousands of Afghans who have applied for entry to the U.S. through the Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program. Including families, they total 50,000 or more. Mr. Biden vowed to evacuate them as well, as a matter of national honor.</td>

      <td>The vast bureaucracies of the White House, Pentagon and State Department may have been taken by surprise by what’s unfolded in Afghanistan. But not Allyson Reneau. Thanks to this 60-year-old Oklahoma mother, 10 members of the Afghan Girls Robotics team have escaped from Afghanistan.<br />Mrs. Reneau had met the girls, ages 16 to 18, at a 2019 Humans to Mars summit in Washington while they were on a visit for a robotics competition in the U.S. A few days ago on Instagram, she posted a photo of herself with some of those girls and asked people to pray for a “miracle.”<br />But Mrs. Reneau, who has nine daughters of her own, didn’t sit back and wait for one. Instead, she flew to Qatar on Aug. 9. There a former roommate of hers now working at the U.S. Embassy stayed up all night to process the paperwork needed to get the girls out. The government of Qatar sent a plane and flew the girls out. The rescue is one of the few images of hope coming out of the mess and chaos of Afghanistan.<br />“I just decided to take any action I could to save a few,” Mrs. Reneau explained on Instagram. She went on to warn that “the window is closing” for another group of girls from the team who also need to be rescued.<br />We join all Americans in saluting the pluck and enterprise of this extraordinary woman—and hope it will inspire our own government to devote whatever resources it needs to finish the job. Maybe Mr. Biden should put her in charge.</td>

      <td>The Food and Drug Administration is expected next week to grant full approval of the Covid-19 vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and partner  BioNTech SE ,  according to people familiar with the planning, an action that could spur more vaccination requirements by employers and encourage more people who are hesitant to get vaccinated.<br />The two-dose shot was first cleared in December by the agency on an emergency use basis for people 16 years and older. The emergency designation allows for products to be distributed during public-health crises based on the best available evidence.<br />Opponents of mandatory vaccinations have cited the emergency approval as grounds for not requiring inoculations, so full approval is expected to lead more businesses and institutions to require mandatory vaccinations.<br />Public health officials and vaccine experts also hope full approval will sway some people who have been hesitant to get vaccinated. About 60% of eligible people in the U.S. are fully vaccinated, according to federal figures.<br />Three in 10 unvaccinated adults said they would be more likely to get vaccinated if one of the vaccines currently authorized for emergency use were to receive full approval from the FDA, according to a June poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation.</td>

      <td>Treasury suggests how states can continue the incentives not to work.</td>
      <td>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh on Thursday broke the news to Democrats in Congress that the Administration doesn’t intend to extend the $300 federal unemployment bonus past the Sept. 6 expiration date. Hold the confetti.<br />“As President Biden has said, the boost was always intended to be temporary and it is appropriate for that benefit boost to expire,” the secretaries wrote to Sen. Ron Wyden and Rep. Richard Neal. But they added: “there are some states where it may make sense for unemployed workers to continue receiving additional assistance for a longer period of time.”<br />They are implicitly acknowledging that unemployment continues to run far higher in states run by Democrats. Unemployment nationwide fell to 5.4% in July, but it was above 7% in Nevada (7.7%), California (7.6%), New Mexico (7.6%), New York (7.6%), Connecticut (7.3%), New Jersey (7.3%) and Illinois (7.1%). All have Democratic governors.<br />On the other hand, unemployment in some states run by Republicans such as Nebraska (2.3%), Utah (2.6%) and South Dakota (2.9%) have hit pre-pandemic levels. Others such as New Hampshire (2.9%), Idaho (3.0%), Alabama (3.2%), Oklahoma (3.5%), Georgia (3.7%) and Indiana (4.1%) aren’t far off.<br />One reason is they didn’t impose excessive lockdowns. Another is that most GOP states ended the $300 bonus and other emergency benefits and 78 weeks of eligibility for benefits in June or July (normal is 26 weeks). The jobless rate last month averaged 4.4% in the 25 states that ended benefits in June or July and 5.7% in the others. Yet progressives still insist the unemployment sweeteners aren’t reducing the incentive to work.</td>

      <td>Biden’s lawless eviction ban is heading back to the Supreme Court.</td>
      <td>President Biden’s latest national eviction ban was a knuckleball pitch to the federal judiciary. Last week a district judge said she would have struck the order immediately, if not for the fact that the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld an earlier stay. On Friday the D.C. Circuit, in a terse per curiam order, declined to reverse.<br />Next up, batting for the Supreme Court, is Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The previous eviction ban was nearly tossed out by the Supreme Court in June, when four Justices voted to lift the lower court’s stay. Justice Kavanaugh agreed the eviction ban was illegal, but he left it in place as a matter of forbearance until it expired July 31.<br />Recognizing that five Justices make a majority, the White House admitted it had no authority to renew the eviction ban. Mr. Biden called on Congress to extend it, but lawmakers did not oblige. Next the White House, under progressive pressure, reportedly trolled law professors to get the answer it wanted to hear. Then Mr. Biden renewed the eviction order all by his lonesome, ignoring the best legal reading.<br />The White House tried to argue that the old eviction ban was totally different, since the new one covers only areas where Covid-19 transmission is “high” or “substantial.” Yet most of the U.S. was included even then, and the percentage keeps going up. As of Friday’s data, 95% of counties are under the eviction ban. On the entire East Coast, Florida to Maine, the number of exempt counties is in the single digits.<br />Mr. Biden’s real aim was to delay. “I can’t guarantee you the Court won’t rule if we don’t have that authority,” he said, “but at least we’ll have the ability, if we have to appeal, to keep this going for a month at least—I hope longer.” This strategy has bought the eviction ban two and a half weeks already, which is why the Supreme Court should move with dispatch.</td>

      <td>He offers unsparing words about Trump and Biden, a defense of nation-building, and he says U.S. soldiers may have to re-enter Kabul in force to rescue Americans.</td>
      <td>As Americans despair over the Afghanistan catastrophe, few have more cause to take it personally than retired Gen. David Petraeus. Not only was he commander of U.S. and allied forces there for 13 months in 2010-11; his son and daughter-in-law both served there in the Army’s 173rd Airborne Brigade. That involved an additional measure of personal sacrifice: During his command, he didn’t see his son to avoid making a target of the young man’s unit.<br />In a Zoom interview, I ask Mr. Petraeus, 68, what effect the ignominious withdrawal will have on military morale. He chooses his words carefully without masking his indignation. “I think—particularly for those who served there—that it is very sad,” he says. “It is heartbreaking. It is tragic. And I think it is disastrous.” He asks: “Is American national security better now than it was four months ago?” Then he answers indirectly: “It’s a tough answer to arrive at if folks have given 20 years of service and sacrifice.”<br />The general hastens to add, however, that “this is not the post-Vietnam military; there is no hollow Army.” He says what every American fighting man is inclined to say, “that this is best-equipped, best-trained, most combat-experienced military by far in the world.” It isn’t the Army he joined “as a very young lieutenant” in 1974. “That was a very different Army. That was an undisciplined Army.” He was “very fortunate” to go to an airborne battalion combat team in Italy that was “very elite, and everybody else wanted to go to.” But when he and his fellow officers would “go up to Germany at that time, the indiscipline was just stunning.” And “the racial issues were draining.”<br />Mr. Petraeus sounds pained when comparing “the reality we had” before the pullout to the new status quo. He valued—even cherished—the fallen Afghan government. “However imperfect that government was, however flawed, however many its maddening shortcomings and corrupt activities,” he says, its leaders were “great partners” in ensuring that al Qaeda, Islamic State and other terrorist groups couldn’t re-establish the kind of sanctuary that al Qaeda had under the Taliban before 9/11.<br />Yet he suggests the Taliban are so constrained that they may end up being less difficult to deal with than many Americans fear. Minutes before our interview, he says, he told Tony Blair: “The Taliban may discover that just like a political party, sometimes it’s easier to be an opposition than it is to actually govern.” The former British prime minister “just chuckled,” Mr. Petraeus says, declining to elaborate on Mr. Blair’s reaction. “I’m a loyal man,” he says. “Blair was my wartime prime minister.”</td>

They have made these requests repeatedly.<br />The judge, who has rejected previous attempts to exclude the material, didn’t rule on the requests Friday. Jury selection in the case starts Aug. 31; opening arguments are set to begin Sept. 8.<br />Government prosecutors and Ms. Holmes’s lawyers have argued over which evidence and how much of it should be allowed in the proceedings. Ms. Holmes’s attorneys have argued for narrowing the thousands of pages of evidence brought by the government and disputed whether testimony from patients who received inaccurate Theranos lab tests, internal company emails and details about Ms. Holmes’s wealth should be admissible.<br />Ms. Holmes faces a dozen counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud for what federal prosecutors say was a scheme to defraud investors and patients about the nature of Theranos’s technology. The blood-testing startup closed in 2018 after raising nearly $1 billion from investors with a pitch to reinvent the laboratory testing business by creating a machine that could test for a wide range of health conditions using a few drops of blood.</td>

The CDC’s naming this week of a new analytics panel, featuring Harvard’s Marc Lipsitch and John Hopkins’s Caitlin Rivers, does not change this reality. It opens a new chapter.<br />How so? From the start, our mistake has been our strange reticence to recognize the reality of mild or symptomless Covid. It began on day one with the World Health Organization and certain experts choosing to exaggerate Covid’s deadliness by ignoring mild and unseen cases. The same myopia continues to play  havoc today with our ability to answer a crucial question: How rampant is the Delta variant among the vaccinated? The U.S. is hopelessly trying to draw conclusions from unrepresentative data.<br />In the Massachusetts outbreak that set off government alarm bells, more than 300 vaccinated holiday-makers later tested positive. Were they 100% or 1% of those who returned home with the virus? No idea.<br />In Chicago, 127 of 203 cases associated with the Lollapalooza music festival were fully vaccinated people. Same question.

That resulted in outcry, especially from “Jeopardy!” fans and former contestants who view the show as a bastion of egalitarian intelligence. The public response convinced Sony that it would be impossible for Mr. Richards to continue as host, and prompted his decision to exit that role, according to a person familiar with the situation.<br />Now production has halted on “Jeopardy!”, one of the most valuable properties in television, as Sony lines up one or more stand-ins, and plunges back into the process of hiring a permanent host. Meanwhile, Mr. Richards remains on the “Jeopardy!” staff as executive producer, raising questions about why he was allowed to keep that job, and how he would interact with the host who eventually replaces him.<br />Sony defended the decision and drew a distinction between the role Mr. Richards would have played as the face of the show and the role he will continue behind the scenes. “Mike has been with us for the last two years and has led the Jeopardy! team through the most challenging time the show has ever experienced,” the company said in a statement. “It is our hope that as EP he will continue to do so with professionalism and respect.”</td>

Joni Ernst (R., Iowa), who with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.) on Thursday wrote a letter signed by 55 lawmakers calling on President Biden to implement provisions in a July law that allow Afghans to obtain special immigrant visas after only one year of working for the U.S. government, instead of two years.<br />Such concerns got a new airing on Friday, when lawmakers received unclassified briefings by telephone—one for the House and one for the Senate—with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley.<br />On the call, the officials didn’t provide details on the number of people with special-immigrant-visa status who had been evacuated. Members complained that people they were trying to help had been turned away from the gates, and asked what the official Biden administration policy was on extending the withdrawal beyond Mr. Biden’s Aug. 31 target date, according to people on the call.

      <td>Frances Glessner Lee’s ‘Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death’ are hyper-detailed dioramas used to educate forensic experts.</td>
      <td>Upon first glance, Frances Glessner Lee’s miniature interiors resemble nothing more than quaint dollhouses. Complete furniture sets occupy the rooms; coin-sized paintings hang on the walls. Decorative objects—a vase, a candlestick, a picture frame—are made all the more believable by the inclusion of utilitarian ones: a laundry sack, a carpet sweeper, a kitchen timer. Curtains glow with the suggestion of sunlight—or moonlight—passing through them.<br />Such details invite close inspection. Almost instinctively, you imagine yourself small enough to walk among them. You pause to admire the fringe on a lampshade, or the pattern on a rug, or the necktie draped across a vanity mirror—a sight so ordinary you nearly miss it—and then you shift your gaze once more, eager to consume the next piece in what you’ve come to expect is an alternate reality as complete and nuanced as your own. And this is when the horror hits.<br />In ‘‘Living Room” (1943-48), one of 20 reconstructed crime scenes known collectively as “The Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death,” the victim lies face down at the foot of the stairs, half concealed by the back wall. The rest of the room seems relatively undisturbed until you spot her, at which point even the most unassuming tableaus become potential evidence. Could the scattered newspapers be grounds for foul play? What about the ashtray of burnt sage? Is the Sherlock Holmes book resting on the coffee table a clue, or did Lee merely think it funny to plug a detective story? These are the questions the “Nutshell Studies” inspire, and surely some of the same ones labored over by forensic experts at the annual Frances Glessner Lee-Homicide Investigation Seminars, which began at Harvard University in 1945 and are now hosted at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore, where all but one of the 19 surviving dioramas are on loan.<br />Lee (1878-1962) was born to a wealthy Chicago family. Though her father barred her from attending university—believing that a woman’s place was in the home—his fortune is what eventually enabled her to pursue science. In the 1930s, Lee used her inheritance to establish and endow Harvard’s Department of Legal Medicine, which granted her access to top scholarship of the day. In 1943, she used her remaining wealth to fund the construction of her first Nutshell Study, “The Case of the Hanging Farmer,” and spent the next five years painstakingly engineering the rest.<br />Lee’s scenes usually depicted female victims whose deaths were unmistakably brutal. As objects of study, they helped forensic scientists and police learn to identify visual evidence, all while raising awareness about the existence and severity of domestic violence. In “Parsonage Parlor” (1946-48), a woman lies across the floor, a knife protruding from her stomach. In “Dark Bathroom” (1944-48), the victim seems to have fallen—or been thrown—into a bathtub, a stream of water obscuring her face. In “Red Bedroom” (1944-48), she’s collapsed on the closet floor, wrists bound. The deaths of Lee’s few male subjects pale in comparison. Take, for instance, “Sitting Room and Woodshed” (1953), on permanent display at the Bethlehem Heritage Society in Bethlehem, N.H., in which a fully dressed man lies clumsily atop a couch. Cause of death? The bottle of whiskey on the floor suggests he drank himself to it.</td>

      <td>Confused wokesters who like to rant about alleged oppression in America’s free society will now get a chance to see a truly oppressive, intolerant and bigoted regime operate in Afghanistan. Already, the Taliban has provided an actual example of an armed insurrection for U.S. media folk to ponder.<br />Tragically for Afghans and the world, the Taliban’s armed insurrection succeeded so quickly after the withdrawal of U.S. troops that these oppressors are now further arming themselves at our expense. The Journal’s Brett Forrest reports:<br />The speed of the collapse has been particularly shocking to those who made the mistake of crediting the words of the U.S. president. Alberto Nardelli at Bloomberg reports:<br />No wonder Mr. Biden wasn’t eager to pick up the phone when Mr. Johnson called this week.<br />Last month, Mr. Biden provided another wildly inaccurate forecast about  Afghanistan in comments to reporters at the White House. Five days later, no fewer than 23 American staffers at our embassy in Kabul signed their names to an urgent cable to Washington directly contradicting Mr. Biden’s public claims.

      <td>Labor-market recovery and inflation crucial to the central bank’s timeline</td>
      <td>U.S. government bond yields made their largest one-day gain in over a week on Friday, following signals that the Federal Reserve is on track to begin reversing easy-money policies later this year.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note increased to 1.259% compared with 1.241% on Thursday. ​This week, though, yields declined the most in three weeks, snapping a two-week winning streak.<br />Yields, which move in the opposite direction of bond prices, have recently reversed part of a decline from earlier this month. That is in part due to expectations that the Fed will begin to scale back, or taper, asset purchases, a view reinforced by the release this week of minutes from the central bank’s July meeting.<br />In recent days, the labor market’s recovery and inflation numbers have been at the center of the debate within markets about the Fed’s timeline to end bond purchases and eventually begin raising rates. Meanwhile, yields on U.S. Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, have moved higher in recent weeks, according to Tradeweb data.<br />“The question really was more on the jobs front and would there be sufficient progress made on that front to at least advance taper discussions,” said Chip Hughey, managing director of fixed income with Truist Advisory Services, in reference to the July jobs report. “It appears that progress is being made that is sufficient for tapering to begin so I believe the market began to prepare itself for that development.”</td>

      <td>Frederick Douglass and Republican legislators had high hopes for Andrew Johnson—but ended up impeaching him.</td>
      <td>If the Civil War is often thought of as America’s “Iliad,” the period immediately following it more resembles “King Lear”: the woeful, bombastic tale of a flawed leader whose vanity eclipsed his better instincts.<br />When Andrew Johnson—“King Andy” to his detractors—assumed the presidency in early 1865, many Republican politicians considered him the best possible person to oversee Reconstruction. Although he was a Democrat and the son of a tailor who went through life with an outsize chip on his shoulder, Johnson had earlier caught the nation’s attention by taking a heroic stand against secession in Tennessee. As the wartime governor of that state, he unilaterally (and illegally) freed the state’s enslaved people. Then, in a remarkable and widely publicized speech in October 1864, he declared himself the “Moses of the Colored Men,” a man prepared to lead the formerly enslaved population of the South to freedom.<br />Within six months, the same progressive leaders who praised Johnson not only had soured on him, they had begun to consider impeaching him. Outside Congress, no one expressed greater hope and disappointment in the administration than Frederick Douglass, the most influential African-American writer, speaker, and thinker of his era, who initially tried to steer the president toward black suffrage and then, in frustration, became one of the earliest critics to call for his removal from office.<br />In “The Failed Promise,” Robert S. Levine has written an engrossing account of these two men and the fractious period that began after the Confederate surrender at Appomattox and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. His book presents the battle over Reconstruction primarily from the perspectives of Johnson and Douglass, in the process illuminating what was at stake in the febrile political climate of the postwar period.<br />We tend to forget that the United States was born twice. Its first nativity is celebrated on the Fourth of July. The second followed a bloody four-year war in which nearly three-quarters of a million soldiers died. In the wake of the conflict, the country found itself at a crossroads, confronted once again with the task of imagining a new future for itself. Under what conditions should the rebellious Southern states be re-admitted into the Union? How were the rights and safety of a newly free population to be secured? Was it possible to achieve both of these goals at the same time? If not, which one should take precedence?</td>

      <td>Different as they were, both writers were compelled by the tension between the physical and the ideal.</td>
      <td>What a pleasure these days to come across a book that unabashedly, cheerfully celebrates the lasting power of literature. Jonathan Bate takes his cue straight from one of the subjects of his dual biography “Bright Star, Green Light.” “A thing of beauty is a joy for ever,” chanted the Romantic poet John Keats (1795-1821) at the beginning of his long poem “Endymion” (1818). “Its loveliness increases; it will never / Pass into nothingness.” Well, “Endymion,” roundly panned upon publication for being too florid, almost did pass into nothingness. No such worry today: Although Keats didn’t make it far beyond his 25th birthday and there isn’t all that much life to cover, he seems to get a hefty new biography every five years. And while “Endymion” still isn’t a critical favorite, the poem’s opening lines, perennial as the art they celebrate, have sustained generations of literature lovers. As they also did—and this is the starting point of Mr. Bate’s book—an otherwise very different writer, the American novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940).<br />An odd pair they certainly make: Fitzgerald the flamboyant high priest of Jazz Age glitter, a compulsive talker, college drop-out and no-holds-barred alcoholic, and “Mister John Keats five feet hight,” as he called himself, the socially awkward, formally trained physician who believed writing poetry was nothing special yet couldn’t imagine himself doing anything else. “Every man whose soul is not a clod / Hath visions,” he asserted in his unfinished epic “The Fall of Hyperion.” Small wonder that he told his fiancée Fanny Brawne he wasn’t “a thing to be admired.” Fanny and, it turns out, F. Scott Fitzgerald begged to differ. Granted, the American writer’s admiration could, at times, border on silliness. For example, as a diffident Princeton student, Fitzgerald once rewrote Keats’s “Ode on a Grecian Urn” (1819) as an ode to his as-yet-untouched Greek textbook, “thou joyless harbinger of future fear.” And, later, in an informal literature course he created for Sheilah Graham, his last lover, Fitzgerald changed the title of that same ode to “A Greek Cup They Dug Up.” Other tributes mentioned by Mr. Bate are of a more hidden sort, allusions meant for the well-read. The title of Fitzgerald’s last completed novel, “Tender Is the Night” (1934), came from Keats’s “Ode to a Nightingale” (1819), which also provided the source for an obscure line describing the protagonist’s music room in “The Great Gatsby” (1925): “There was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall.” In the original ode, Keats’s light, of course, streamed not from the hallway but straight from heaven, “with the breezes blown.”<br />But Mr. Bate also draws our attention to those striking moments in Fitzgerald’s work in which the very fabric of the American writer’s imagination flashes “Keatzian” (distractingly, Mr. Bate relies on Fitzgerald’s idiosyncratic spelling throughout his book). Think of the green light across the bay the love-stricken Jay Gatsby saw burning all night, next to Daisy Buchanan’s house. At the end of the novel, Fitzgerald’s narrator Nick Carraway, sprawled out on the beach, relates that green flicker to the fresh, green, simpler world full of promise that once beckoned to the first Dutch sailors who came here. Gatsby’s noble, selfless sacrifice, taking the blame for the hit-and-run Daisy committed, redeems his lies and missteps. In spirit if not in letter, Fitzgerald pays tribute here to Keats’s early sonnet “On First Looking Into Chapman’s Homer” (1816), where the poet likens his discovery of Homer to the excitement of a conquistador glimpsing, for the first time, the Pacific Ocean. Okay, Keats, in his enthusiasm, mixes up his generals, substituting Cortés for Balboa, but as Fitzgerald slyly observes: “When an immortal like Keats makes a mistake, that too is immortal.”<br />Fitzgerald’s favorite Keats poem, hands down, was “Bright star! would I were stedfast as thou art,” a sonnet long regarded as the poet’s final work, written after he had seen Venus rise outside his window. Along with Daisy Buchanan’s green light, Keats’s imperturbable planet, guarding the world from afar “with eternal lids apart,” supplies the title of Mr. Bate’s book. But in the poem Keats finds that, rather than astral transcendence, he wants earthly immanence, wishing for nothing more than that he could lie forever “pillow’d upon my fair love’s ripening breast.” Of course Fitzgerald adored that poem.<br />As Mr. Bate explains, both Keats and his American confrère fought hard to reconcile mind and body, the world of lofty ideas with the palpable delights of the Earth. But here’s the important distinction, one that Mr. Bate doesn’t fully acknowledge: For Keats, a hoped-for kiss would always bestow a more intense enjoyment than one granted, a pleasure deferred a more piercing reward than one gratified. While Fitzgerald’s protagonists (and their creator, too) would hasten from one fleeting fulfillment to the next, Keats leaves his lovers in limbo: “Their lips touch’d not, but had not bade adieu” (“Ode to Psyche,” 1819). And that was a place he personally knew only too well, yet one for which a sonnet’s frozen beauty, the delayed symmetry of a perfect rhyme, always offered a sweetly satisfying equivalent, a lasting consolation.</td>

      <td>Showtime’s four-part docuseries studies the history of tabloids through the work of Cindy Adams, the legendary New York Post columnist.</td>
      <td>A four-part docuseries, “Gossip” (begins Sunday, Showtime) follows the history of tabloid reporting as well as the career of the New York Post’s Cindy Adams, indisputably a legendary figure. Hers was a career that would flourish, as it continues to do today, from the late 1970s on. In New York City there was a new energy in the air. A separate column, the Post’s “Page Six,” soon to achieve superpower status in the world of gossip reporting, began in 1977. Every celebrity with something to hide feared a call from Page Six, while others relished entry into the pantheon of people who had made it into the column.<br />For Cindy Adams, hobnobbing with movie stars and royalty, and the otherwise rich and famous, was no novelty. Which is how she managed to interview the deposed leader countless millions wanted to see dead—namely, the shah of Iran, who was gravely ill, heavily guarded and under treatment at New York Hospital. In the film she recalls having to call off a dinner date with the Post’s then chief editor, the beloved Roger Wood, who tended to address everyone in the office as “hello lovely.” Or occasionally, “lovely one.” Though the subject didn’t come up in the Showtime series, it was impossible when watching it not to wonder how he would have fared in today’s reign of “Me Too” charges involving language. Wood was disappointed that Ms. Adams would not be coming to dinner—that is, until she told him that the shah, whom she had met many times and visited in Iran, had sent a message asking her to come to the hospital. Wood of course asked, in his gentle way, if she could possibly write something after seeing the shah. She didn’t know, she said. But of course she did the column.<br />There’s a lot more of these sorts of journalistic anecdotes in the series—all of them irresistible, much of them wrenching mainly because of the pictures that flood the screen of Americans now sorely missed. Among them a nattily dressed Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whom she encounters one Easter Sunday.<br />We learn how she came to adopt the term “Only in New York, kids, only in New York,” her summary line for everything strange and improbable that she reported. She had one day spotted, on Park Avenue, a grand-looking matron walking a tiny dachshund barely two inches high and screaming at him “Don’t you understand English?” And the thought came to her: only in New York!<br />I spent a fair amount of time in the New York Post newsroom of the early 1980s—long enough to savor its uninhibited atmosphere, its tolerance for the impromptu, its warmth, its fun. All of which is the lead-in for one of the most memorable moments in that room, though it was connected to a deeply sad and traumatic event in New York. A child had somehow been mauled to death by a bear in one of the city’s zoos. No one knew what to write, what to say about this grim event. Suddenly, one of the Post’s longtime reporters leapt on top of his desk and called for silence, whereupon he roared: “Wait a minute, wait a minute—we know what to do now! Cindy Adams knows one of the bears.”</td>

      <td>A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposal about art on duck-hunting licenses is causing debate</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—There are people who love ducks. And people who love to hunt ducks.  Both groups are waterfowl fans, but sometimes agendas clash. Feathers are ruffled. This time, it’s over artistic differences.<br />Waterfowl hunters and others who buy hunting licenses known as Federal Duck Stamps are arguing about their imagery. The stamps are collected by non-hunters, often conservationists, bird watchers and wildlife photographers who like the duck-themed artwork.<br />A rule instituted during the Trump administration requires the new hunting stamps to show waterfowl and depict hunting. Some say the rule ought to be killed. Others say hunting stamps ought to reflect hunters’ contribution to conservation.<br />Slightly larger than postage stamps, Duck Stamps cost $25 and must be purchased by waterfowl hunters over age 16. Hunters typically put them on paperwork brought into the field. The stamps feature a new picture each year.<br />The stamps give purchasers access to the country’s network of roughly 570 wildlife refuges. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service dedicates the proceeds to growing and protecting those refuges. It also conducts an annual competition for the stamp’s artwork.</td>

      <td>The artist will be celebrated for outside headshots that vibrate with energy, but his work also honored the creative minds in his orbit.</td>
      <td>Chuck Close, one of the most important painters of the postwar era and a blue-chip name in the contemporary art world, died on Thursday at age 81. One of the last surviving pioneers of the old New York art scene in SoHo, where he moved in 1967, Mr. Close became a marquee figure thanks to his monumental portraits. Painted from photographs taken by Mr. Close and executed with such precision that he found himself included in the nascent Photorealism movement (an association he rejected), they were field-filling head shots in which every detail down to the smallest pore was meticulously recorded. While he experimented with style and medium across his long career—painting, printmaking, drawing, collage, photography, tapestry—Mr. Close will always be remembered for his attentiveness to the human face, for his regard for and manipulation of that most unique of physical characteristics.<br />Born in 1940 in Monroe, Wash., Mr. Close struggled early as a student due in part to undiagnosed dyslexia, but he would go on to attain a sterling academic artistic pedigree. After a stint at a junior college, he received a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Washington and an master of fine arts from Yale, where his classmates included such other future luminaries as Richard Serra, Brice Marden and Vija Celmins. A Fulbright in Vienna came next, then a teaching position at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.<br />Early in his career, Mr. Close worked mostly as an Abstract Expressionist, leaned toward a Pop vernacular, then focused on figuration—moving away from DeKooning-flavored paintings and freeing himself from the influence of the past, ironically, by putting the constraint of representation on this work.<br />The real breakthrough came when he set down the paintbrush and picked up an airbrush: “Big Self-Portrait” (1968), a 7-foot-tall, black-and-white image of the artist staring out, cigarette between his lips, opened a new chapter in Mr. Close’s career. Quickly acquired by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis directly from the artist’s studio, it was just the first in a series of massively scaled, similarly detailed grayscale portraits of his family and friends.<br />Color works, his first solo show in New York, and his first major museum exhibition, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, soon followed. In 1988, he suffered a spinal artery collapse that at first left him paralyzed from the neck down; he’d remain confined to a wheelchair, but after rehab he was able to continue painting with a brush strapped to his hand and created work for the rest of his life. By the time he was stricken, his style had started to loosen, and the grids that had invisibly underpinned his earlier work became more explicitly part of his imagery. He subsequently evolved a more impressionistic manner—his portraits, composed of fields of pixelated or swirled color, appeared nearly abstract when seen up close but would resolve themselves into immense faces when viewed at a distance.</td>

      <td>More than ever, design pros value the versatile folding antique card table—which easily morphs from decorative side-table to functional game surface…and so on…and so on….</td>
      <td>THE DEMAND FOR  flexibility in our living spaces has made the antique game table especially beloved by interior designers today. Pros, however, have long considered the morphable table a secret hero. “They are quiet pieces of furniture, but they do a job,” said Emily Todhunter, an interior designer in London.<br />The vintage game—or card—table doubles its surface when its hinged top is unfolded: A rectangular model becomes square, a demi-lune a circle. Either the top spins and is held up by the piece’s frame, or legs swing or pull out for support. Some harbor a bit of hidden storage; others, like the Queen Anne example below, a small drawer. Game tables that don’t reveal felt or velvet when expanded can be set against a wall and decoratively opened to 90 degrees, as in the vignette above.<br />Providence, R.I., interior designer Susan Loney has hauled her Chippendale-style game table through multiple moves. “I used it in an entry hall when I was living in an apartment,” she said. Now it serves as an occasional table in her living room when not pulled out for extra dinner seating. A traditionalist, Ms. Loney loves the way the engraved heirloom on delicate legs fits in with her toiles. “I’ve used them for many clients in the dining room as a sideboard,” she added.<br />The folding game table took off in the early 18th century when gambling surged in popularity, according to Peter Lang, a senior vice president at Doyle Auction House. Initially designed simply in sturdy walnut, the tables later grew more ornate in more-carvable mahogany. Some were fancified with marquetry and brass detailing. While centuries-old tables in pristine condition can fetch high five-figure prices at auction, a 19th-century mahogany demi-lune game table sold in August for $50 on Liveauctioneers.com.<br />Ms. Todhunter uses these rich brown tables, which she prizes for their patina, to warm more sterile, modern décor, layering them up with flowers, lamps and art books. Recently, she began considering game tables for workspaces. Many designers, she said, “are now being asked to decorate guest bedrooms with a little desk area for Zoom calls.” There, the game table can also double as a night stand. A tip from Ms. Todhunter: Accessorize with a cordless lamp for easy removal when you want to unfold the top.</td>

      <td>It has a capable army, a functioning representative government—and a need for continued U.S. help.</td>
      <td>The Afghan army’s failure to slow the Taliban’s seizure of power contrasts starkly with generally favorable developments in Iraq. As Afghanistan descends into the abyss, Iraq advances toward legitimacy at home and internationally. After years of fitful leadership, extremist threats, sectarian violence and Iranian interference, Iraq is on course to becoming a self-reliant, democratic state and, at least for now, an impediment to Iranian regional aggrandizement. America’s efforts, sacrifices and patience in Iraq are paying off.<br />The U.S. found no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. What it did find was a homicidal regime under Saddam Hussein, and the debris of a sectarian army whose mission had been to brutalize the Iraqi people. Arabs and Kurds were on the brink of war. Though rich in oil and gas reserves, Iraq’s economic development had been stunted by state involvement designed to enrich those in power. The rule of law meant nothing but total obedience to Saddam.<br />Conditions in Iraq in the wake of invasion may have seemed hopeless, with a spreading Sunni insurgency, the arrival of foreign terrorists, and Sunni-Shiite violence. Still, the U.S. and 35 partner nations worked with Iraqis of all political stripes, religious beliefs and regions to help build representative government responsive to the needs of all Iraqis.<br />The first step was to help the Iraqis write a new constitution that provides for a separation of powers among branches of government and establishes basic rights for all Iraqis, irrespective of sect, ethnicity and sex. It obligates the Iraqi state to the rule of law, an independent judiciary, civilian control of the armed forces and universal suffrage. The constitution says that no less than 25% of parliamentarians be female, and it opened the way for Iraqi women to receive educational and professional equality, though in Iraq as elsewhere, words must be followed by actions.<br />Iraq’s constitution came into force after it was overwhelmingly approved in a national referendum in 2005. Since 2004, Iraq has had five straight peaceful transfers of power. Although its governments have performed unevenly—some poorly—none has clung to power when its time was up. A notable example is how Nouri al-Maliki, pro-Iran prime minister from 2006 to 2014, was succeeded without conflict by Haider al-Abadi, a less pro-Iran figure from a different party. This record is unmatched among Arab countries and defies pundits’ predictions that Iraqi democracy would fail.</td>

      <td>Hedge-fund billionaire William Ackman, who launched the largest-ever special-purpose acquisition company with an aim of landing a big target to take public, may now return its funds to shareholders in the face of a lawsuit questioning the vehicle’s legality.<br />Mr. Ackman disclosed plans to unwind the $4 billion vehicle,  Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd. , in a letter to its shareholders that was posted to his firm’s website.<br />“While we believe the lawsuit is meritless, the nature of the suit and our legal system make it unlikely that it can be resolved in the short term,” Mr. Ackman wrote, adding that it could also deter potential deal partners from working with the SPAC.<br />The move represents a further retreat after Pershing Square Tontine backed away from a deal to invest in Universal Music Group. The vehicle was launched last summer, and in June announced plans to buy a 10% stake in Universal Music from French media conglomerate  Vivendi SE .  The complicated move surprised some investors who expected more of a traditional SPAC deal, in which an empty shell raises funds in an IPO and then looks for a business to merge with and take public.<br />But Mr. Ackman dropped the plan the following month after failing to convince the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the deal met the rules for such vehicles and some shareholders balked. Instead he said his investment firm, Pershing Square Holdings Ltd., would take a stake in Universal.</td>

      <td>Massive bureaucracies will evade them. The better solution is to break up huge school districts.</td>
      <td>I knew we’d lost the day I met the superintendent of North Carolina’s schools in 2011. I was leading a nonprofit whose civics curriculum was a stark improvement over the mishmash that the state’s teachers were then using. The Legislature had recently passed the Founding Principles Act, which required North Carolina schools to teach concepts like property rights, due process and federalism. Unlike the textbooks then in use, our materials were loaded with facts and original documents, illuminating concepts that undergird the U.S. Constitution and its founding. We were offering exactly what the state’s new law required.<br />The superintendent and her team were polite and engaging, but we couldn’t understand much of what they said. They tossed around jargon like “inquiry models” and “cross-walked objectives,” and insisted that North Carolina schools already met the new law’s standards. My colleagues and I walked out of that meeting knowing that—law or no law—civics instruction in our state wouldn’t change a bit.<br />I recall this experience as state legislatures debate bans on teaching Critical Race Theory, a body of conjectures that is, according to its defenders, simultaneously sound and nonexistent. Even where allowed to stand by courts, these laws, like other efforts to rein in education bureaucrats, will be swallowed up in the spreadsheets and matrices into which state departments of public instruction lure and quietly strangle every curricular reform.<br />That’s not to say that state leaders have no options for warding off CRT, transgender mania, Howard Zinn-style grievance Marxism and other dogmas festering in schools of education. They have the authority to implement a solution that harnesses the common sense of everyday American parents. They can bust up large school districts.<br />Take Loudoun County Public Schools in Virginia, ground zero for the CRT war. Loudoun County, once 522 square miles of horse pasture with scarcely enough two-legged residents to qualify as a bedroom community, saw its population explode by nearly 400% over the past 30 years. According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, the number of students in Loudoun’s public schools grew from 14,174 in 1990 to 83,606 in 2020—an increase of 490%. Nine school board members oversee curricular decisions and teacher training affecting tens of thousands of families in an area nearly half the size of Rhode Island (which, by comparison, serves its 144,000 students via 66 separate school districts).</td>

      <td>The freedom-loving Marquis de Lafayette tried to import the ideals of the American revolution to his native France.</td>
      <td>Most readers of The Wall Street Journal will recognize Lafayette by name. One of the few non-Americans counted among the heroes of the Revolution, dozens of American towns, counties and streets are named for him. But what of the niceties of the Marquis’s eventful life, spanning 1757 to 1834? Those who take up Mike Duncan’s comprehensive, birth-to-death biography will find this French-born nobleman, soldier and statesman to be a fascinating and paradoxical character. Fusing revolutionary energy with a tendency to seek moderation, even compromise, he was as extraordinary as the times in which he lived.<br />Mr. Duncan—famous for his podcasts “The History of Rome” and “Revolutions”—is the bestselling author of “The Storm Before the Storm: The Beginning of the End of the Roman Republic.” Now, in the three-part doorstopper “Hero of Two Worlds” he shows how a youthful, “restlessly defiant” Lafayette evolved into an even-tempered, moderate reformer, while always keeping true to his ideals. Lafayette early embraced the American Revolution (1776-83), later helped instigate the French Revolution (1789-99)  and, later yet, encouraged France’s July Revolution (1830). Given his half-century of wide-ranging, trans-Atlantic activities, it is not surprising that Lafayette’s contemporaries and modern historians alike offer widely differing assessments of a career that thwarts easy summation.<br />Part I (1757-86) introduces Lafayette’s French context and unpacks his formidable role in the American Revolution. Born at the Château de Chavaniac, in Auvergne, the infant aristocrat was baptized Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier. Lafayette jested: “I was baptized like a Spaniard. But it was not my fault. And without pretending to deny myself the protection of Marie, Paul, Joseph, Roch and Yves, I more often called upon Saint Gilbert.” Independence would be Lafayette’s calling card, perhaps inevitably. When he was a toddler, his father died fighting in the Seven Years’ War. Lafayette’s only sibling, a younger sister, died too. With the death of his mother, in 1770, young Gilbert was orphaned, “left emotionally and psychologically alone in the world.” Still, resilient, he was commissioned an officer when 13. Great wealth helped too. Relocating to Versailles, he married into the powerful Noailles family and pursued a military career.<br />Mr. Duncan admits “it is hard to pin down the precise moment Lafayette latched on to the great ideas that animated the rest of his life: liberty, equality, and the rights of man.” By age 19, Lafayette had shed any “clumsy adolescence.” Having changed his coat-of-arms motto to “Cur Non” (“Why Not?”), in 1777 he sailed across the Atlantic seeking action in America’s War for Independence. Befriended by George Washington—the two maintained a lifelong friendship—he also “hit it off” with Alexander Hamilton, and others, like John Laurens and Thomas Jefferson.<br />Wounded at the Battle of Brandywine (September 1777)—“a musket ball shot clean through the fleshy muscle of his lower calf,” explains Mr. Duncan—the “legend of Lafayette, ‘the Hero of Two Worlds,’ was born.” In 1779 Lafayette was back in France, lobbying the American cause but itching to rejoin the battlefield. Soon, he again commanded American troops, including at the pivotal Siege of Yorktown (1781). America’s Revolutionary War concluded, Lafayette entered a “new phase of his life,” Mr. Duncan argues.</td>

Perhaps Mr. Soros will start supporting candidates who can unite America and help it prosper, so we can meet the challenge presented by China.<br />Marty Cummins<br />New Smyrna Beach, Fla.<br />We know Mr. Soros likes the idea of “open societies.” Who in the West doesn’t? But why is he assuming these cultures want to be remade in our image—like Nancy Pelosi, who thinks the Taliban cares that “the world is watching”?<br />Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party are no threat to the West. They know they’re gone if they don’t sustain “social harmony” for China’s new middle class. Treating the party as a great-power rival like the Soviet Union dignifies its inferior system and shows insecurity in our own. We can still service Chinese consumers without admiring their government. And we won’t spend Mr. Xi’s regime out of business like we did Mr. Gorbachev’s.

      <td>Regarding “The Case Against Masks for Children” (op-ed, Aug. 9) by Drs. Marty Makary and H. Cody Meissner: As pediatric pulmonologists, we feel strongly that universal masking for children is appropriate and needed to counter the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends masking precisely because it has been shown to reduce transmission. Further, much of the student population isn’t currently eligible for vaccination.<br />A cohort study conducted in Italy among children 24 months to 12 years old found that mask wearing wasn’t associated with significant changes in either carbon-dioxide or oxygen levels. There is no study showing that masks cause increased resistance to inhalation or exhalation.<br />In denigrating mask-wearing by children, Drs. Makary and Meissner cast doubt on an economical, effective and judicious public-health measure. The same analogy and reasoning could argue against the use of parachutes or seat belts. There are enough good-quality studies with convincing evidence to tilt the risk and cost-benefit ratios of wearing masks strongly in favor of the benefits to children. The alleged risks articulated by the authors, such as fogging of eyeglasses, severe acne, increased resistance to breathing, increased CO2, masks becoming vectors for pathogens and deformation of facial structure, are far-fetched speculations not borne out by evidence or peer-reviewed publications.<br />Jonathan Popler, M.D.<br />Atlanta</td>

As a result, Xi Jinping, China’s most powerful leader in decades, is rewriting the rules of business for the world’s second-largest economy.<br />Mr. Ma failed to keep pace with Beijing’s shifting views and lost an appreciation for the risks of falling out of step, according to people who know him. He tuned out warnings for years, they said. He behaved too much like an American entrepreneur.<br />Mr. Ma’s exit from the world stage followed a typically frank speech in October, when he criticized Chinese regulators for stifling financial innovation.

      <td>Inland from the rollicking Riviera Maya lie more-discreet charms for travelers, from grand haciendas to underground swimming holes. Just don’t expect a swim-up bar.</td>
      <td>I RACED ALONG a narrow trail, slicing through dense brush, accompanied by buzzing bugs, birdsong and frantically scurrying lizards. I was in Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula, three hours west of the swim-up pool bars of Cancún, following Alberto Delgado, a man who calls himself “the cenote hunter.” Thousands of cenotes, underground cave pools fed by fresh water, dot the peninsula. In addition to finding cenotes, Alberto also buys and sells them. Parcels of land that contain these pools start at $80,000. My journey to this particular cenote, called Santa Barbara—one of several on property Alberto owns—was unintentional. He forgot to bring the keys to another of his cenotes down the road.<br />When finally we reached Santa Barbara (no key required) after a 25-minute hike, Alberto said, “I didn’t want to bring you here because a lot of people are afraid of entering.” I approached the opening and could see why: About 60 feet below was an enchanting-looking pool. But the only way to reach it, short of a terrifying leap, was a long climb down a network of ladders strapped to the stone wall. “What do you think?” he said.<br />I nodded warily, and we started the careful climb down. When I got near the bottom, I jumped into the cool, crystal-clear spring water. Below, catfish circled the depths. As if summoned by our entry, a midday ray of sunlight shone from above, so intense in the center that it illuminated the water all the way to the bottom. The translucent water was a haven from the jungle above—free of bugs and heat, silent and tranquil in a way that was entirely unexpected after our hike. “Can you feel the way that the cenote embraces you?” Alberto said. Floating alongside him in this subterranean pool, I learned that Alberto, a former stockbroker in Mexico City, started living part of the year in the Yucatán interior in 2010, in the small city of Valladolid, just a half-hour north of this cenote. “The coast is beautiful,” Alberto said. “But now it is also packed with people almost everywhere. And so I’ve come inland. Here it feels untouched, intact.”<br />The Yucatán Peninsula encompasses three Mexican states, as well as chunks of Guatemala and Belize. But when most travelers speak about the Yucatán, they mean just one small part of this 70,000-square-mile land mass: the eastern, coastal regions of Mexico’s Quintana Roo state, stretching from Cancún south to Cozumel, Playa del Carmen and Tulum. In recent years Merida, the urban capital of Yucatán State, has also started to draw tourists lured by the cultural attractions of that million-person-plus city (Foreign travelers are permitted in Mexico but even fully vaccinated tourists must take a Covid test before re-entering the U.S.). But aside from Merida visitors and busloads of tourists day-tripping to Mayan ruins, the central and western parts of the Yucatán are ripe for exploration. This other side of the Yucatán offers dozens of cenotes, well-preserved colonial cities such as Valladolid and Campeche, rural villages built around old haciendas and roadside restaurants dishing up Mayan specialties such as pork slow-cooked underground.<br />In search of a Covid-era escape to a part of Mexico where I could steer clear of packed resorts, I began my trip in Valladolid, staying in a one-room hotel, Meson de Malleville (for about $260 a night). It is set on a square that fronts an ancient convent partially in ruins but still managing to host mass every morning. The Meson houses a boutique in front that gives way to an interior courtyard, and then a striking hotel room with 18-foot ceilings, a plunge pool, outdoor shower and a huge window facing verdant bushes and tall trees. The view from the bed makes you feel as if you are sleeping deep inside the jungle.</td>

      <td>LONDON—The U.K. government said it was considering an in-depth probe of  Nvidia Corp . ’s proposed $40 billion takeover of Arm Holdings after the nation’s antitrust regulator found the deal raised serious competition concerns, the latest challenge for a merger that would reshape the global computer-chip industry.<br />Nvidia’s acquisition of Arm would lead to a realistic prospect of less competition, a stifling of innovation and more expensive or lower-quality products, according to a summary of the regulator’s report published Friday. The antitrust concerns were part of a broader report that also addressed national-security concerns, which the government didn’t make public.<br />U.K. Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said he was now considering asking the antitrust regulator to conduct a more-thorough investigation of the proposed merger. There is no timetable for that decision. The digital secretary could eventually decide whether to nix the merger or to approve it, with or without conditions.<br />An Nvidia spokesman said the company looked forward to addressing the antitrust regulator’s “initial views” and resolving any concerns from the U.K. government. Nvidia’s chief financial officer said earlier this week that while discussions with regulators were taking longer than they had initially expected, the company was confident that the deal would go through.<br />Based in Silicon Valley, Nvidia makes chips for videogaming, data centers and other businesses. It is now the largest U.S. semiconductor company by value after overtaking  Intel Corp .  by that measure. Last year Nvidia proposed buying Arm, a U.K.-based subsidiary of Japan’s  SoftBank Corp . , that designs the basic blueprints for the chips in more than 95% of the world’s smartphones.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden just weathered his most tumultuous week as commander-in-chief and his problems are unlikely to go away any time soon.<br />Bipartisan criticism rained down on the president amid the chaos that came with the rapid Taliban takeover of Afghanistan as the U.S. approached Mr. Biden’s deadline to withdraw troops. Americans and U.S. allies remain in the country awaiting evacuation that Mr. Biden has acknowledged could go past the end of August if there are U.S. citizens left behind.<br />Lawmakers are calling for hearings into the administration’s handling of the withdrawal of U.S. troops and are asking why more Americans and Afghans who worked with the U.S. weren’t evacuated beforehand. The coming anniversary of the Sep. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks will highlight the Taliban’s swift takeover of the country 20 years after the U.S. invasion.<br />“It’s been, sadly for America, I think an unfortunate week for the administration,” said Rep. Dean Phillips (D., Minn.), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, though he said the decision to withdraw might look better in the long run.<br />Mr. Biden campaigned on his foreign-policy experience and pledged to be a stabilizing force in the world, casting himself as a contrast to the unpredictable foreign policy of the Trump administration. His handling of the Covid-19 pandemic has been generally well received by the public and the economy appears strong. Last week, the Senate voted to pass a bipartisan infrastructure bill that is a central piece of his economic agenda.</td>

      <td>U.S. Chamber of Commerce, pharmacy-benefit managers group challenge federal requirements</td>
      <td>U.S. business groups sued to block parts of a federal rule requiring insurers and employers to disclose prices they pay for healthcare services and drugs, the latest legal challenge to efforts to make public rates that have long been kept secret.<br />The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents pharmacy-benefit managers, filed lawsuits against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other federal agencies last week in federal courts in Tyler, Texas, and the District of Columbia. They claim certain provisions of the rule go beyond federal authority and could raise healthcare costs.<br />The Biden administration has backed healthcare pricing transparency as a way of boosting competition in the industry, as did the Trump administration, which instituted the rule. Much of healthcare pricing is set through confidential deals that have long kept rates under wraps, often leaving consumers in the dark about the cost of care.<br />The rule requires that health plans, including those offered by employers that are self-insured (meaning they pay their workers’ medical costs themselves), make public rates they pay to hospitals and other healthcare providers, starting in 2022.<br />The rule also requires price disclosures for drugs, including a measure called the “historical net price” that factors in the effects of rebates, fees and discounts. The data is supposed to be made available in a format that can be read by computers.</td>

      <td>Pfizer Inc.’s  ability to supply billions of doses of its Covid-19 vaccine hinges on two employees working on opposite sides of the world.<br />From her home in Andover, Mass., Amy Genest scouts for companies that can make Pfizer’s shot. After finding a partner, she hands over the project to Poonam Mulherkar, an engineer in Gandhinagar, India, who manages the top-secret transfer of the vaccine’s blueprint and manufacturing.<br />The women belong to a select group of drug-industry staff who may hold the key to helping countries overcome limited supplies of doses—and accelerating the world’s vaccination campaign against the pandemic.<br />Vaccine makers like Pfizer, though they have significantly increased their output of shots, can only make so much at their own plants. Mses. Genest and Mulherkar are among a relatively small number of professionals with the rare skill set to enable other companies to produce the shots.<br />Their work, requiring expertise in biochemical engineering to pharmaceutical manufacturing, is called technology transfer.</td>
