      <td>News Corp  reported a 30% increase in revenue for the June quarter, fueled by gains in its digital real-estate, book-publishing and Dow Jones units.<br />The New York-based media company, whose holdings include The Wall Street Journal and the HarperCollins publishing division, narrowed its net loss to $14 million, or 2 cents a share, from the year-earlier $397 million, or 67 cents a share. Revenue grew to $2.49 billion from $1.92 billion.<br />The company’s news-media businesses showed strong growth in advertising sales, as the easing of the pandemic led marketers to increase their spending.<br />Revenue at the Dow Jones unit increased 18% to $449 million, driven by gains in advertising revenue and circulation and subscription revenue, as well as the company’s acquisition of Investor’s Business Daily. Advertising revenue increased 45%, with strong performance in both the digital and print businesses.<br />The company said digital-only subscriptions to Dow Jones’s consumer products grew 26%. The Wall Street Journal had more than 2.7 million average digital-only subscribers in the quarter, compared with 2.63 million in the March quarter. Total average subscriptions to Dow Jones consumer products reached about 4.5 million, the company said.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Nearly three dozen of the nation’s most influential business groups—representing retailers, chip makers, farmers and others—are calling on the Biden administration to restart negotiations with China and cut tariffs on imports, saying they are a drag on the U.S. economy.<br />The tariffs on electronics, apparel and other Chinese goods, which are paid by U.S. importers, were kept in place in part to ensure that China fulfills its obligations under its 2020 Phase One trade pact with the U.S.<br />In a Thursday letter to U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the business groups contend that Beijing had met “important benchmarks and commitments” in the agreement, including opening markets to U.S. financial institutions and reducing some regulatory barriers to U.S. agricultural exports to China.<br />“A worker-centered trade agenda should account for the costs that U.S. and Chinese tariffs impose on Americans here and at home and remove tariffs that harm U.S. interests,” the letter said, referring to the administration’s policy to make worker interests a priority.<br />Spokesmen for the U.S. trade representative’s office and Treasury didn’t immediately respond to requests for comments.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Ten Republican senators have signed on as co-sponsors of a bipartisan bill to repeal the 1991 and 2002 authorizations for use of military force in Iraq, a key threshold needed to overcome a Senate filibuster.<br />It is the latest sign that lawmakers of both parties are gaining traction in their efforts to reassert Congress’s constitutional power to declare war, the culmination of years of debate over the commander in chief’s latitude to send troops into combat abroad, and a reflection of waning public support for America’s so-called forever wars.<br />The Senate’s longstanding filibuster rule requires at least 60 votes for most legislation to advance. In the evenly divided 100-person chamber, that means at least 10 Republicans would have to join with all 50 Democrats in order for the repeal to succeed.<br />The legislation, led by Sens. Todd Young (R., Ind.) and Tim Kaine (D., Va.), would repeal both the 2002 Iraq War and 1991 Gulf War authorizations.<br />The measure passed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with support from members of both parties on Wednesday, 14-8.</td>

Scherr, who pleaded guilty last year in U.S. District Court in Dallas to two criminal counts stemming from the insurers’ collapse, is a former associate of a young financier named Alexander Chatfield Burns who built a New York-based insurance empire.<br />The empire collapsed in early 2014 after Mr. Burns checked into a mental-health ward of a hospital and left behind an affidavit describing unusual asset transfers. The insurers’ collapse was the focus of a 2015 page-one article in The Wall Street Journal.<br />Federal regulators in a separate 2018 civil action alleged that Messrs.

      <td>The evocative name for the sound of a ricocheting bullet has become an all-purpose alert</td>
      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />As cases of Covid-19 surge again in Great Britain, the country’s National Health Service has tried to stem the tide with a phone app that asks people to self-isolate for 10 days if they come into contact with someone who has tested positive for coronavirus. Those who are advised to take precautionary measures receive a notification, or a “ping,” in everyday parlance.<br />Last month, as the NHS Test and Trace app began “pinging” hundreds of thousands of people’s devices with self-isolation alerts, British media outlets were quick to dub the flurry of activity a “pingdemic.” And there have been many more variations on the “ping” theme. A headline on the satirical site NewsBiscuit imagined a “pingageddon” in which “NHS Covid app forces entire UK population to self-isolate.” In a Reddit forum called British Problems, one user moaned, “I’m starting to loathe the word ‘ping,’” while another observed, “We now live in the United Pingdom.”<br />While the “pingdemic” may be a novel phenomenon for the pandemic era, the word “ping” goes back nearly two centuries, first emerging as onomatopoeia for a short, high-pitched metallic sound, like bullets ricocheting. The Oxford English Dictionary notes an 1833 example from Michael Scott’s serialized novel “Tom Cringle’s Log,” describing a nautical battle: “We all pricked up our ears, and strained our eyes, while a bright, spitting sparkling fire of musketry opened at the gap, but there was no ping pinging of the shot overhead.” Two years later, another Scottish writer, James Edward Alexander, wrote in a travelogue about the civil war in Portugal, “If a button was shown, ‘ping’ went a bullet at it immediately.”<br />The 20th century brought new uses of “ping” as an interjection, noun and verb. With the advent of the internal combustion engine, new terms were devised to describe the metallic rattling noise created by faulty combustion: In the United Kingdom, the sound was called “pinking,” while in the United States and Australia, “pinging” was preferred. A 1923 advertisement for motor oil in the Detroit Free Press, for instance, referred to “the knocking or ‘pinging’ often experienced with an overheated or badly carbonized engine.”</td>

      <td>The report on Cuomo finds credible allegations of sexual harassment—and a deep weirdness.</td>
      <td>Let’s stop for a second to reflect on the state attorney general’s report in the case of Andrew Cuomo. I have read the 165 pages. It is a narrative about charges of sexual harassment that investigators found credible, and that were more numerous than expected. But there is a real Crazytown aspect to the story.<br />The governor of New York is painted as a public leader who treats the young women around him as sexual prey. The report details close and intimate hugs, kisses, buttock-grabbing, breast-grabbing, leering comments and violative questions and statements. Have you cheated on your husband? Would you? I am lonely. Have you been with older men? Would you find me a girlfriend? To one target he described his criterion for a girlfriend as someone who can “handle pain.” This is all too believable. His prey included not only women who worked for him but a state trooper he saw at an event and got assigned to his security detail even though she didn’t meet the position’s requirements. He then targeted her for harassment.<br />He had a modus operandi. When a woman whose bare back he was stroking grabbed his wrist and removed his hand, he remarked, “Wow, you’re aggressive.” He then asked for a kiss. He had an air of entitlement: He was taking what was his. Many of the events described in the report occurred after the pandemic had raised his profile to that of public hero. Politicians are never so dangerous as after a triumph.<br />The women were all afraid of him—he screamed, berated and was known to be vengeful. The culture of his office was rife with fear and intimidation. A victim: “It was extremely toxic, extremely abusive. If you got yelled at in front of everyone, it wasn’t any special day. . . . It was controlled largely by his temper, and he was surrounded by people who enabled his behavior.” Everyone feared retaliation for speaking out, so they didn’t.<br />But there is deep weirdness beyond that. He ordered one aide to memorize the lyrics to “Danny Boy.” She testified he “would pop out” of his office and ask her to start singing. A footnote says it was not the only time the governor asked her to sing. The aide found herself writing to a former staffer, “He just asked me to sing Bohemian Rhapsody so. We aren’t far off from a bedtime story.” He asked her to do push-ups in front of him, and asked what people were saying about the size of his hands. According to the report the aide testified that “she understood the Governor was attempting to get her to say something about the size of his genitals.” Another aide testified that, in complaining to staff that a speech was disappointing, the Governor said something to the effect of “You need to give me some catchy one-liners. Come up with a line like, ‘you’re having sex without the orgasm.’ ”</td>

      <td>As Friday deadline looms, mediator works with agency officials, union for customs and immigration officers</td>
      <td>OTTAWA—Talks under a mediator’s watch continued late Thursday between Canada and the union representing its border agents to head off a labor action starting Friday that threatens the flow of U.S.-Canada trade and a plan to allow American tourists to visit for the first time in 16 months.<br />The two sides agreed to work with a mediator ahead of a 6 a.m. Eastern time Friday deadline set by the union, the Public Service Alliance of Canada. The alliance said customs and immigration officers would begin paring back services at land crossings, airports and shipping ports unless a new agreement is reached by that time. The union said “massive disruptions” at Canada’s borders were possible.<br />Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday he was hopeful the mediator would help reach an agreement. The federal labor-relations board appointed a mediator Wednesday.<br />Roughly 9,000 unionized workers at the Canada Border Services Agency have been without a contract for about three years. Two-thirds of those workers are classified as essential, and unable to go on strike. Instead, the union said these workers would conduct a work-to-rule campaign, which entails measures such as slowing down the paperwork process and refusing overtime. The union warned of long and unavoidable delays for goods trying to enter or leave the country, and Canadian travelers returning to the country.<br />“Don’t work during your breaks or unpaid lunches. Don’t work past your scheduled work hours. Ask every question in your manual at ports of entry,” said a notice this week for border agents from one of the Public Service Alliance of Canada’s affiliated unions.</td>

      <td>Manufacturers, unions and environmental groups join him to promote zero-emitting vehicles and the benefits they’ll provide.</td>
      <td>Sometimes it isn’t what you say but who’ll stand with you when you say it. On Thursday President Biden stood alongside the leaders of the big three U.S. auto makers and the president of the United Auto Workers as he announced his goal that half of all new cars sold by 2030 would produce no tailpipe pollution and directed the Environmental Protection Agency to begin developing new standards for cars, trucks and buses. The Biden administration has unified manufacturers, labor and environmental groups behind a common purpose: to accelerate the manufacturing of zero-emitting vehicles and the economic, health and climate benefits they will provide.<br />By forging common ground with business and labor, the administration created a path forward that is more durable, providing certainty to companies and long-term environmental benefits to American families.<br />Ford ,  General Motors and Chrysler’s parent company all back the president’s approach, and they have pledged to spend $100 billion to make it a reality. Look no further than Ford’s recent introduction of the electric F-150 Lightning—a zero-emitting version of the bestselling U.S. vehicle for the last 40 years—or GM’s plans for an electric Chevy Silverado for evidence of the opportunity auto makers see in the transition to zero-emission vehicles. These same companies and many others are investing in zero-emitting freight trucks and buses. Earlier this week, GM announced it will build zero-emitting school buses, and Ford sells an electric version of its Transit delivery van. American consumers and the businesses, truckers and fleets that own these vehicles will benefit, too, saving thousands of dollars in fuel costs.<br />Mr. Biden is also sending an unmistakable sign that the U.S. intends to lead in developing zero-emitting vehicles—a signal that will provide the long-term certainty that manufacturers need to plan. That will help unlock the next $100 billion in investments and the jobs those investments will create here in the U.S.<br />As company after company announces a transition to electric vehicles, it is clear that the global auto industry is moving to zero-emissions vehicles. But it is an open question where the vehicles and their parts will be produced. Europe and China have a head start, but the president’s announcement makes clear that American workers will play a lead role. Democrats and Republicans alike would rather drive cars built in Georgia, Michigan and Texas than Germany or China.</td>

      <td>The U.S. offers refuge to Hong Kongers afraid to return home.</td>
      <td>The sad reality for any President watching Beijing dismantle a free and vibrant Hong Kong is that the outside world has few options to stop it. So kudos to President Biden for finding one that at least delivers relief to those in personal jeopardy.<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Thursday that the U.S. will offer Hong Kongers “safe haven” for 18 months from forced departure from the U.S. if they fear returning to the city. He says the step is a response to China’s “sweeping National Security Law,” which has “fundamentally altered the bedrock of Hong Kong’s institutions.” Hong Kongers have ample reason to fear, given that police there are now arresting people even for booing the Chinese national anthem.<br />In January the British did their part for Hong Kongers by giving holders of British National (Overseas) passports the option to resettle in the U.K. and apply for citizenship. A Home Office fact sheet reckons that there are 2.9 million BN(O) holders in Hong Kong, with a further 2.3 million eligible dependents—impressive numbers given the city’s total population of 7.5 million.<br />The Biden Administration’s suspension of deportations follows its business advisory last month warning U.S. companies that doing business in a territory where Beijing is enforcing a new national security law carries “potential reputational, regulatory, financial, and, in certain instances, legal risks associated with their Hong Kong operations.”<br />GOP Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska underscored the bipartisan American support for Hong Kong by applauding the President’s move as “a solid step,” but he wants the U.S. to go further. He says Washington should “offer full asylum to Hong Kongers who flee Chairman Xi’s brutal oppression.” Mr. Sasse is right. Mr. Biden should also press Beijing to release such Hong Kongers as publisher Jimmy Lai and others who have been imprisoned merely for supporting freedom and democracy.</td>

      <td>What a spectacle. We’re referring to the political advertisement that auto makers staged with President Biden on Thursday endorsing the Administration’s stricter fuel-economy rules and climate agenda. Behold Big Business colluding with Big Government to grab subsidies and raise consumer prices.<br />The White House previewed the electric-vehicle promo with joint statements from auto makers, the United Auto Workers and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.  Ford ,  GM and Stellantis (formerly  Fiat Chrysler ) announced their “shared aspiration” for electric cars to make up 40% to 50% of their sales in 2030. EVs make up a mere 3% of current U.S. sales, and most are Teslas.<br />“This represents a dramatic shift from the U.S. market today that can be achieved only with the timely deployment of the full suite of electrification policies committed to by the Administration,” including government incentives for consumers, charging stations and battery manufacturing, Detroit’s auto makers said. For “incentives,” read subsidies.<br />BMW ,  Ford,  Honda ,   Volkswagen  and Volvo seconded the need for “bold action from our partners in the federal government.” Politicians as partners? The five auto makers previously struck a deal with California to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions after the Trump Administration eased the Obama corporate average fuel-economy (Cafe) standards.<br />The Biden Administration is adopting the California deal as the framework for its revised Cafe rules from 2023 to 2026. The mileage mandate will increase by 10% in 2023 from the existing standards in 2022 and then by 5% each year through 2026 to 52 miles per gallon by 2026. They will also earn extra regulatory credits for producing more EVs.</td>

      <td>Biden’s nominee has a history of hamperingthe agency he’d lead.</td>
      <td>The Biden Administration is tweaking the dials of its border policies to slow the flow of migrants this summer. Yet its long-term commitment to lax enforcement seems as fixed as ever. One example is the nomination of a top immigration officer whose main qualification is hampering the agency he’s been tapped to lead.<br />President Biden in April picked Ed Gonzalez, sheriff of Harris County, Texas, to head Immigration and Customs Enforcement. On Wednesday the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee advanced Mr. Gonzalez on a 7-6 party-line vote. But Republicans flagged the nominee for his yearslong effort to block ICE from operating fully in the Houston area.<br />Mr. Gonzalez’s first major act as sheriff in 2017 was to withdraw from an arrangement that lent local support to ICE investigations. The 287(g) program deputizes state and local officers to report on the immigration status of criminal offenders, which can lead to deportation. In 2020 the program led to the removal of nearly 3,000 serious offenders.<br />Pressed to explain the withdrawal during his July committee hearing, Mr. Gonzalez pointed to limited resources, saying his agency was short-staffed and $8 million in arrears when he took office. Never mind that the ICE collaboration cost less than 1% of the sheriff’s-office budget, and lent only 10 of its more than 2,000 officers to the immigration program.<br />Mr. Gonzalez hoped to go further by withholding certain suspected aliens from ICE custody, but said state law gave him no choice. He told Senators he doesn’t intend to end local cooperation as ICE director. But he would gain the authority to reduce criminal apprehensions, which have already fallen dramatically since President Biden took office.</td>

But could they also help protect seniors against dementia and Alzheimer’s disease? There’s reason to hope so.<br />Growing evidence indicates that seniors who get vaccinated against illnesses such as tetanus and even the flu are much less likely to develop Alzheimer’s, the leading cause of dementia, characterized by a buildup of amyloid plaque and tau tangles in the brain. Scientists don’t completely understand why, but many hypothesize that vaccines generate a systemic immune response that can reduce inflammation in the brain, which results in neuron loss and cognitive decline.<br />Among the first pieces of evidence was a 2001 study that tracked roughly 3,600 Canadians over 65. After adjusting for age, sex and education, the researcher found that past vaccinations for diphtheria/tetanus, poliomyelitis and influenza were associated with a 59%, 40% and 25% lower risk for Alzheimer’s, respectively.<br />The study had shortcomings. The differences discovered between the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups could have been due to confounding variables. People who get vaccinated, for instance, may also be more likely to get regular checkups and suffer fewer underlying conditions like diabetes that increase the risk for Alzheimer’s.<br />But more-recent studies controlled for these factors and still found a strongly beneficial association between vaccines and Alzheimer’s. A research article published in the Journals of Gerontology in April examined the link between Alzheimer’s and the Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis) vaccine. By using health records from the Veterans Health Administration and a large database of private medical claims for seniors over 65, researchers could adjust for variables such as demographics, health-services utilization, health conditions and medications. After these adjustments, they found that seniors who had received the Tdap vaccine had a 42% lower risk of developing dementia than those who hadn’t.</td>

      <td>Why not eliminate the selection process that feeds nationalism?</td>
      <td>I’m a proud Greek-American, and the Olympics have a special place in my heart. Every couple of years, the world is treated to a spectacular display of athletic ability in summer and winter formats at a carefully selected national venue.<br />The athletes embody a fine quality of “olympism” as they strive to live up to the Olympic values of excellence, friendship and respect. The Olympic website is full of messages about how the games bring nations together in fair and open athletic competition.<br />But the games have all too often become overt displays of odious propaganda (the 1936 games were put on by the Nazi regime in Berlin) or the setting for fierce geopolitical arguments, such as when the U.S. and other Western nations boycotted the 1980 games after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan.<br />China, Russia, the U.S. and other major powers with the financial ability to support the games fight hard to host them. The supposed financial benefits seldom seem to materialize. But it’s also an opportunity to show soft power to allies, partners, friends and send a message to opponents. Winning the venue often feeds virulent nationalism that runs counter to Olympic ideals. The frequent corruption associated with the selection process doesn’t help.<br />A solution would be to construct a pair of Olympic facilities, one for summer and the other for winter, which could be used every two years permanently. The expense for the construction and subsequent maintenance of the global facility could be shared among participating nations as a percentage of their economy with respect to global gross domestic product. The U.S. would fund 15%, Europe 15%, China 15%, India 7%, Japan 4%, Russia 3%. The smallest nations would receive a very small bill.</td>

      <td>Joseph Gordon-Levitt directs and stars as a dissatisfied fifth-grade teacher and aspiring composer in this Apple TV+ dramedy series set in the Covid-19 era.</td>
      <td>Billed though it is as comedy-drama, it’s clear from the start of “Mr. Corman” (begins Friday, Apple TV+) that the laughs in this 10-episode series will be few but the smiles of recognition frequent. It’s a testament to the complex charms of this series that those smiles are as often summoned by bleak moments as happier ones. Some of the most engaging aspects of this tale derive from the problems that arise when its hero, Josh Corman (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who is also the show’s creator, producer and director), undertakes efforts to pursue women—situations that yield some of the most hilarious moments. They’re moments made still more enticing by the flow of pure venom that follows when characters’ plans go awry. Things can go wrong on dates, everyone knows—some of them the most intimate kind of going wrong. And in the world “Mr. Corman” describes, there’s not a lot of gracious forgiveness to spare at such times.<br />It’s all to the good to see animal passions emerge, however irregularly, in a character like Josh, who is, it’s quickly established, a schoolteacher—clue No. 1 that he shouldn’t be seen as the happiest of men, or anything like a proudly assertive one. By his own inner lights, he’s not very successful either. It’s a point made more than once.<br />One woman fancying that he insulted her, and moved thus to express her rage, hurls the message out clearly: If he’s teaching it’s because he knows there’s nothing else he can do. You can feel his silent flinch. The truth is there is something else he can do, and he wants desperately to do it—only it doesn’t come with a salary. The real love of his life, deep and abiding, has nothing to do with teaching: it’s making music, composing it.<br />Still, every weekday Josh faces his classroom of fifth-grade students with full devotion to his task, and a certain affection for his charges, who sometimes ponder large questions. Does good luck matter more than talent? They have opinions on such \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmatters.<br />But living has now been rendered difficult for Josh by a strange, new and extreme uneasiness that seems to grow daily, something far harder to endure than ordinary anxiety. This new discomfort, bordering on the unbearable, is enough to drive him to call a doctor. But, as one might expect in a saga of this kind, the only doctor he knows won’t be available for two months.</td>

      <td>Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard star as a celebrity couple with an unusual child in this offbeat musical, directed by Leos Carax, with an unmemorable pop-opera score by the Mael brothers’ band.</td>
      <td>The French film director Leos Carax has always seemed plagued by contradictory impulses. He can’t resist being transgressive—he was a charter member of what the critic James Quandt dubbed the “New French Extremity” of the late 20th century. He wants to remain relevant, though his best-loved film remains “Les Amants du Pont-Neuf” (“The Lovers on the Bridge”), which dates back to 1991. Occasionally, he allows his gift for creating poetically beautiful and architecturally elevated cinema to spill out across the screen. The thing that eludes Mr. Carax—as “Annette” so amply and painfully demonstrates—is balance.<br />With a pop-opera score—and a script—by the band Sparks (brothers Ron and Russell Mael), and performances by Adam Driver and Marion Cotillard as artist-lovers in Los Angeles, “Annette” might suggest a trip to “La La Land,” another film that bent the movie musical. What the two do have in common, and it isn’t much, is a buoyant  opening song (“Another Day of Sun,” the “La La Land” opener, began on a highway exit ramp, and was never quite topped by any other number in the film). “So May We Start?”—which kicks off “Annette”—begins in an L.A. sound studio and spills into the streets with a smiling Ms. Cotillard, the Mael brothers, Mr. Driver, co-star Simon Helberg (“The Big Bang Theory”) and others marching toward the camera, which backs its way down the sidewalk and into the real start of the movie. Almost immediately, blitheness achieved is blitheness abandoned.<br />Mr. Driver plays Henry McHenry, a confrontational comedian doing an extended run at L.A.’s Orpheum Theater. “Are you ready!?” bellows the announcer. “No one is ever ready for a mildly offensive evening with the ‘Ape of God’!”—the name of Henry’s show. Dressed for the stage in a hooded robe, shorts and house slippers, Henry warms up for his show like a boxer and then assaults his audience with a very edgy and not always successful battery of what might or might not be jokes. Henry isn’t funny, but he’s an example of why so many directors, from Lena Dunham to Martin Scorsese, want to work with Mr. Driver: Emotionally, he can be angelic; physically, he’s all animal energy, power and the sense of danger Henry wants to impose on his audience. Evolution itself isn’t far from one’s thoughts when Mr. Driver stalks the Orpheum stage.<br />And evolution, of the cultural variety, is a theme Mr. Carax is exploring. Henry’s shock-shtick can only become cruder; his audience wants to be offended, but perhaps not appalled as they are by his romance with Ann Defrasnoux, the in-demand soprano holding forth at the Walt Disney Concert Hall. There, she “dies and dies and bows and bows,” as Henry puts it, very unhappily. Her repertoire, from what we see and hear, is a distillation of operatic tragedy, a highlight reel of doomed heroines (Carmen, Madama Butterfly, etc.). Ann herself is a kind of reduced, washed-out human—and as her art becomes more refined and defined, Henry’s becomes grosser and less effective, their unlikely romance becoming fodder for the fictional “Show Bizz News,” which interrupts the story with updates about their life together. This will include marriage and the birth of a daughter, the animatronic Annette.<br />Yes, the title character is, for most of the film at least, a very animated toy, who as an infant begins to sing quite beautifully. What does she represent? She’s a provocation, a crawling-then-walking critique of artificial culture but also the most sympathetic character in the movie, a movie that might be a stage show: The numerous back-projections suggest a museum installation, the sets are largely simple and static, and Annette in her robot form dispenses with the need for human children, so even a high school could put on a production. Any high school, however, would probably balk at the music. Ms. Cotillard sang her way lustily through the Edith Piaf biopic “La Vie en Rose” and won a Best Actress Oscar for it, but she can’t make the score any more than what it is, dialogue set to unhummable melodies. Mr. Driver is really not a singer at all, despite his valiant efforts, and he makes the Mael brothers’ unmemorable music more of an effort to listen to than it would otherwise have been.</td>

      <td>Peterborough Players presents Thornton Wilder’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play, staged outdoors in the village where it came into being.</td>
      <td>Peterborough, N.H.<br />Thornton Wilder’s “Our Town” may or may not be the greatest American play—that’s a matter of opinion—but it is surely the Great American Play, the one that most fully embodies the everyday lives of this country’s ordinary people. As the Stage Manager, Wilder’s narrator, puts it, “This is the way we were: in our growing up and in our marrying and in our living and in our dying.”<br />But while Grover’s Corners, the New England hamlet (pop. 2,642) where “Our Town” unfolds shortly after the turn of the 20th century, is portrayed with seemingly precise particularity, its characters are archetypes brought to bold life without benefit of scenery or props and whisked from scene to scene by the omniscient Stage Manager. Moreover, he addresses the audience directly, stepping into the “realistic” framework of “Our Town” on occasion to play an assortment of secondary characters. These devices have long since been absorbed into the lingua franca of international theater so completely that it is easy to forget that Wilder invented them, and that they were radical innovations when the play opened on Broadway in 1938.<br />Part of the particularity of “Our Town” arises from the fact that Wilder wrote much of it at MacDowell, the artists’ colony located in Peterborough, the New Hampshire village (pop. 6,688) that is also home to the Peterborough Players, one of the most accomplished summer repertory theaters in the U.S. Though he took care never to say so outright, the play is widely believed, not least by the locals, to be modeled on the place where it came into being. (The city-limit signs proudly say “Welcome to Our Town.”) Accordingly, it has always figured prominently in the Peterborough Players’ repertory—I saw it there in 2008, with James Whitmore giving a peppery and unsentimental performance as the Stage Manager—and the company is reopening after the Covid-19 lockdown by mounting “Our Town” again, performing it in an improvised 150-seat outdoor theater on a lawn close to the center of town.<br />Tom Frey, the director, has assembled a 17-person cast led by Gordon Clapp (“NYPD Blue”), who plays the Stage Manager with a flat-voweled, quietly amused detachment reminiscent of Frank Craven, who created the role in 1938 and whose now-legendary stage performance was preserved in Sam Wood’s 1940 screen version. It is a true ensemble cast, one whose acting is as unflashy and faithful to the spirit of the play as is Mr. Frey’s staging. I was especially struck by Tracey Conyer Lee and Erick Pinnick, who play Mrs. Webb and Dr. Gibbs in a briskly matter-of-fact manner, but their colleagues are worthy of like praise.</td>

If you’re unclear what that means, much of the movie will be, too.<br />Disney films never miss a chance to advertise other Disney properties, and until the very end of “Free Guy”—which features a riot of references to Disney-owned Marvel superheroes—the movie is satisfied to rely on “The Truman Show,” “Ready Player One” and “Groundhog Day” to construct its story (credited to Matt Lieberman and Zak Penn). Guy is a bank teller who arises each morning to the same routine, the same cup of coffee from the same barista, the same greeting with his security-guard buddy—named Buddy (Lil Rel Howery)—and the same vicious holdup by the same despicable criminals in sunglasses. Guy is lovelorn—he wants to meet that special someone, but never does. And then he encounters someone new—Molotov Girl (Jodie Comer), who’s also wearing sunglasses. He decides if he gets sunglasses his life will change. He does. And it does.<br />Guy, we have come to realize, is an NPC in a video game. The shades make him a real player, so to speak. Molotov Girl, it turns out, is actually Millie Rusk, a computer prodigy who with her ex-boyfriend, Walter “Keys” McKey (Joe Keery), created a game called “Life Itself.” Their use of artificial-intelligence software was intended to allow characters to evolve, to make choices and choose their own fates. When they took it to the loathsome Antoine (Taika Waititi), CEO of the Soonami games company, he stole their A.I. engine and shelved their game but used their work in his own “Free City: Carnage.” (“Order now and get bonus mayhem!”)<br />He also hired away Keys, who never deserved Millie anyway: To prove Antoine’s crime, she has created the Molotov avatar, jumped into the game to gather evidence and inadvertently ignited Guy’s sense of destiny—a previously dormant feature of Keys and Millie’s stolen design. The gaming world goes crazy. Who is this guy? Or rather, Guy?</td>

      <td>This year, the Bard Musical Festival is dedicating its programming to the life and work of the pedagogue, composer and musician.</td>
      <td>Always adventuresome and provocative, the Bard Music Festival has been examining major composers for three decades. But unlike previous Bard laureates, this year’s subject—the revered French musician and pedagogue Nadia Boulanger (1887-1979)—is virtually unknown as a composer. Her few compositions, beautiful as they are, have rarely been performed.<br />But as an intrepid woman in the male-dominated musical world of her day, Boulanger was artistically well armed. A masterly organist, she toured the U.S. in 1925 as soloist in the premiere performances of her student Aaron Copland’s Symphony for Organ and Orchestra. One of the first professional female conductors, she was the first woman to lead the Boston Symphony, Philadelphia and New York Philharmonic orchestras, among others. A great Stravinsky advocate, she conducted the 1938 premiere of his “Dumbarton Oaks” in Washington.<br />Nevertheless, it was as a composition teacher and a demanding muse to successive generations of young American composers that Boulanger joined the immortals. She “single-handedly shaped the course of modern American music from Aaron Copland to Philip Glass,” observes Bard Festival founder and co-artistic director Leon Botstein by telephone. “Her influence in this arena is equivalent to that of Enrico Fermi and Albert Einstein on American science.” Spotlighting Boulanger also realizes Mr. Botstein’s longstanding goal “to examine the function of teachers and their value to creative students.”<br />The two Bard Festival weekends (Aug. 6-8 and 12-15), running under the program name “Nadia Boulanger and Her World,” will place the composer’s long career in context through performances and pre-recorded panel discussions and lectures. Each concert is being offered both in person and via livestream, with tickets for both available on the website of Bard’s Fisher Center auditorium. The programs feature a dazzling panoply of music by Boulanger’s mentors, including Gabriel Fauré, Louis Vierne and Charles-Marie Widor, contemporaries like Ravel, Satie and Poulenc, and her extraordinary roster of students, illustrating the evolving world of European and American music in which she worked and spread her influence for over 60 years.<br />Music was in the Boulanger family marrow. Her paternal grandparents were noted musicians; her father was the composer Ernest Boulanger (1815-1900). Nadia’s phenomenal gifts earned her a coveted place at the Paris Conservatoire at age 10. Upon entering the school’s 1908 Prix de Rome competition as a composer, itself a bold move for a young woman, she scandalized the judges by writing an instrumental fugue instead of the stipulated vocal one. Her cantata “La Sirène” ultimately earned her only second place. Ironically, her younger sister, Lili, became the first woman to win the Grand Prix de Rome for music, in 1913, only to die of intestinal tuberculosis in 1918.</td>

      <td>Coming-of-age story meets psychological thriller in this film about a 13-year-old boy who traps his family in a bunker, adapted from a short story by Nicolás Giacobone.</td>
      <td><br />‘You are in so much trouble!” has seldom seemed such an empty parental threat as it does in “John and the Hole,” uttered as it is by a father whose son has put him at the bottom of an unscalable, 20-foot-deep concrete bunker. Dad (Michael C. Hall) isn’t alone—his wife and daughter (Jennifer Ehle, Taissa Farmiga) are along for company, all three having been drugged and dumped there by 13-year-old John (Charlie Shotwell), who peers down, delivers them the occasional meal, but seems to have no intention of ever setting his family free.<br />A selection of the Cannes and Sundance film festivals, “John and the Hole” has been described as a coming-of-age story, but that’s an overly simplified pigeonhole for a movie about something that happens to someone who happens to be young. Certainly, there’s a tone of faux-innocence and untrammeled nature in the movie’s generous, forested residential locations—the fact that John just stumbles upon the bunker, which some neighbors had begun and abandoned, suggests the wealth, seclusion and acreage in which John exists, and the emptiness, too. There are certainly no epiphanies or revelations (other than those that may be experienced by the viewer), and anyone looking for an easily digestible moral about Today’s Youth will struggle.<br />That lack of specificity, however, is one intention of a movie that toys with presumptions and twists expectations. Played with a brilliant blandness by Mr. Shotwell, John is made sympathetic in the opening moments by a teacher who belittles the boy for what seems like typical adolescent vagueness. But John’s vagueness is all-defining: He is made out to be a tennis ace (his practice swings are mechanical, his face impassive). At one point, he sits at the family’s grand piano and plays Bach like Igor Levit (it’s actually Mr. Shotwell playing, and I may have exaggerated, but the point is that John is gifted). His real enthusiasm, predictably, is reserved for the tennis videogames he plays remotely with his faraway friend Peter (Ben O’Brien), whom John invites—with his parents “away”—for a visit. They exchange very vulgar insults with a marked lack of adolescent heat.<br />Directed by the visual artist Pascual Sisto and adapted by Nicolás Giacobone (“Birdman,” “Biutiful”) from his short story “El Pozo,” the film is overly generous in its use of space (everything is, very tastefully, too much) and is a kind of counter-thriller, almost devoid of music or any other devices usually employed to accentuate the negative. In its way, it pokes at the very delicate membrane between horror and comedy. One might well ask, “Is this a joke?” because John’s appalling acts are portrayed with such a lack of dramatic adornment. The seemingly gentle boy comes home from school, snoops around his mother’s medicine chest, and pops a pill that makes him dopey at dinner; his parents notice without questioning the cause. The boy then doses the gardener—John’s medicated lemonade lays Charles (Lucien Spelman) out flat on the back lawn. After poking him with a stick, John stuffs some cash in the worker’s pocket. It’s not a very subtle touch, but money is the alphabet of John’s emotional language: Charles has served a function, and deserves payment. Having run his test, John then knocks out the family.</td>

It didn’t identify the medical issue.<br />“For once my timing has been a little off,” Mr. Watts said in the statement. “I am working hard to get fully fit but I have today accepted on the advice of the experts that this will take a while.”<br />Mr. Watts hasn’t missed a show since joining the band in 1963, according to Rolling Stone magazine. He underwent treatment for throat cancer in 2004.<br />Drummer Steve Jordan, who has collaborated with Keith Richards and played in the band for “Late Night With David Letterman,” will take Mr. Watts’ place on tour.</td>

      <td>Biden-backed provision aims to boost tax enforcement on crypto transactions</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—A key senator negotiating the roughly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill signaled a willingness to compromise over a provision that seeks to raise money through tougher tax enforcement of cryptocurrency transactions.<br />Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) on Thursday said he agreed on the need to clarify the provision, which he wrote and is backed by the Biden administration. It aims to require brokers of digital assets to report on gains reaped on trading to the Internal Revenue Service. As crafted, it would raise an estimated $28 billion over a decade to help pay for improved roads, bridges, ports and other infrastructure.<br />The amount raised by the provision, while relatively small, signals the latest move by Washington policy makers to impose oversight on an industry that has grown dramatically without regulation. The cryptocurrency industry says the provision is overly broad and could inadvertently encompass bitcoin-miners and other entities and discourage innovation in the fast-growing sector.<br />The significance of cryptocurrency profits as a revenue source may also grow after the Congressional Budget Office found on Thursday that the infrastructure bill would widen the federal budget deficit by $256 billion over 10 years, contradicting negotiators’ claims that the cost of the legislation would be covered by new revenue and saving measures.<br />Three Senators—Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) Pat Toomey (R., Pa.), and Cynthia Lummis (R., Wyo.) introduced an amendment Wednesday that they said would clarify the definition of a broker.</td>

If the court can’t advance the hearing, his request said, Mr. Spears should be immediately suspended as conservator of Ms. Spears’s finances.<br />“Ms. Spears’ emotional health and well-being must be, and are, the paramount concern,” the filing said.<br />Mr. Rosengart is requesting the hearing be set at the earliest date possible on or after Aug. 23. This is Mr. Rosengart’s second request to expedite the hearing. A judge earlier granted his request to move it to September from mid-December.<br />A former federal prosecutor and high-profile litigator, Mr. Rosengart was hired by Ms. Spears in July following her two emotional testimonies on June 23.

Using software that runs on both the iPhone and Apple’s cloud, Apple will detect whether images on the device match a known database of these illegal images. If a certain number of them—Apple declined to say exactly how many—are uploaded to iCloud Photos, Apple will review the images. If they are found to be illegal, Apple says it will report them to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a private, nonprofit organization established in 1984 under a congressional mandate that serves as a clearinghouse for reports of child abuse.</td>

They have said that some of the measures they are using to cover the cost of the bill, including repurposing Covid-19 aid, wouldn’t count the same way toward CBO’s official estimate.<br />Whether Republicans find that argument convincing will influence the level of support the bill ultimately receives.

The White House ruled out raising the federal gas tax or other similar fees on those who use infrastructure, which have historically been sources of funds for infrastructure spending. At the same time, Republicans starkly opposed President Biden’s plan to raise corporate taxes to cover the cost of the spending.</td>

The Senate is currently working on both a roughly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill and a $3.5 trillion bill of Democratic priorities, for which Mr. Manchin’s support will be pivotal.<br />“I am deeply concerned that the continuing stimulus put forth by the Fed, and proposal for additional fiscal stimulus, will lead to our economy overheating and to unavoidable inflation taxes that hard working Americans cannot afford,” he wrote.<br />The Fed cut its short-term benchmark interest rate to near zero in March 2020 and has been purchasing $120 billion per month in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to drive down longer-term rates to provide added stimulus.</td>

The city has faced criticism from local advocates in recent years for forcing homeless people from outdoor encampments and confiscating their items.<br />“Too often we ask law-enforcement officers to be the first and last option for addressing issues that should not be handled by our criminal justice system,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said. “This makes police officers’ jobs more difficult and increases unnecessary confrontations.”<br />It is the third such civil-rights investigation, known as a pattern-or-practice probe, opened under the Biden administration, which has made a priority of overhauling local police agencies after recent high-profile police killings of Black people and minorities sparked nationwide protests. Such investigations can take years and often end in court-enforceable agreements, called consent decrees, designed to force change.</td>

      <td>U.K. inflation leaves policy makers in a bind if the U.S. Federal Reserve won’t act, too.</td>
      <td>Of all the central bankers in the world, we’d least like to be Andrew Bailey of the Bank of England. His unenviable task is figuring out how—or whether—to rein in accelerating inflation in the United Kingdom without help from the Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank. Faced with this conundrum, he punted again at a Thursday policy meeting.<br />The BOE’s monetary-policy committee kept the benchmark bank rate at a historic low 0.1% and announced it will complete its full schedule of £895 billion in bond purchases by the end of this year under the pandemic quantitative easing program. It could have decided to cut short that program with £45 billion left to buy. Commentators purport to hear a newly hawkish tone about the possibility the BOE may scale back its pandemic stimulus sooner than expected. But that’s all it is: a tone. The hawks may be squawking from the tree branches but they’re not in flight.<br />If Mr. Bailey had the luxury of setting policy solely on the basis of developments within the British economy, this would be reckless. Britain is one of the developed world’s standouts in its recovery from the pandemic and lockdowns. Although GDP remains well off its pre-pandemic levels and growth was hobbled by the lockdown earlier this year, other indicators are popping back to life. Employment in some regions now exceeds the pre-pandemic level, and the unemployment rate is falling while job vacancies and hours worked shoot up. Consumer-price inflation is 2.4% year-on-year and climbing.<br />But he doesn’t have that solo luxury. His peers in the eurozone, Japan and especially the U.S. are determined to press ahead with their own pandemic policies even as their economies enter the post-pandemic phase of reopening and recovery. Were Mr. Bailey to shift toward normalization before anyone else, it’s hard to predict the consequences.<br />A particular concern might be hot-money inflows from global investors desperate for yield. This would raise concerns about an uncontrolled appreciation of the pound, with unpredictable price effects given the U.K.’s mix of imports and exports. It’s hard to blame Mr. Bailey for not being eager to find out what those effects might be.</td>

      <td>From her kitchen in Marseille, Georgiana Viou shares her spicy Kipikpa sauce, plus tips on the West African and southern French ingredients that light up her pantry and wisdom on what makes a meal truly memorable</td>
      <td>I’M A WOMAN of the South, or actually many souths,” said chef Georgiana Viou. “This is how I explain my cooking to clients at Rouge.” That’s her new restaurant at the Margaret Hotel Chouleur in Nimes, in southern France. Though she’s originally from Benin in Africa, she’s made her home in Marseilles (near Nimes) for more than 20 years. “Today I’m as much Marseillaise as I am Beninoise,” said Ms. Viou, though she wouldn’t describe her cuisine as Afro-Provençale. “I don’t do fusion cooking. My cooking is spontaneous, seasonal and very personal.”<br />Born into a long line of female chefs, caterers and entrepreneurs in Cotonou, Benin’s largest city, Ms. Viou went to France to study literature at the Sorbonne. Eventually she realized that “cooking is what I like to do more than anything else.” Her cookbook “Le Goût de Cotonou: Ma Cuisine de Bénin” was published in May (in French) by Éditions Alain Ducasse.<br />“The Beninoise kitchen is complex, subtle and varied,” Ms. Viou said. “Different dishes are cooked along the Atlantic shore, once called the Slave Coast, than in the interior. Descendants of Brazilian slaves who returned home, as well as Portuguese and Brazilian slave traders, have had a big impact on our cooking, too. And Benin was a French colony for almost a century.” Here, Ms. Viou shares tips from her sunny kitchen.<br />The kitchen tool I can’t live without is: my wodatin, which is a wooden spatula typical of Benin. I buy a bunch of new ones in the market in Cotonou every time I go home. And my Microplane grater, because I use a lot of fresh ginger and this is the fastest way to grate it. My blender. And my knives, including one that was my grandmother’s.<br />My pantry is always stocked with: olive oil, palm oil, vinegar, tomato paste, gherkins, red pepper paste, mustard, brown sugar, black chocolate for dessert, flour, honey, dried hibiscus flowers, fleur de sel, black pepper, rice, pasta. And ingredients from Benin like gari or tapioca. Plus my mother’s secret special spice powder—and no, I’m not giving you the recipe!</td>

      <td>When clear evidence is lacking, they project their own Covid speculations as authoritative scientific judgments.</td>
      <td>In times of public-health emergency, the federal government takes on the role of a provider of information. Unfortunately, as “The CDC’s Delta Variant Panic” (Review & Outlook, July 31) illustrates, our government has fallen into a pattern of not only vacillating between contradictory positions, but also fanning the flames of Covid-19 misinformation.<br />This pattern extends to the earliest days of the pandemic. Far from providing leadership, agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and figures such as Anthony Fauci have a record of projecting their own unfounded speculation as authoritative scientific judgments on matters in which they lack clear evidence. Recall how the CDC spent spring 2020 attempting to dissuade the public from buying masks, how Dr. Fauci described the risk of Covid to the U.S. as “minuscule” in late February 2020, and how “two weeks to flatten the curve” morphed into two months, then a year.<br />More recent vacillation includes ever-changing advice on masks, a re-evaluation of the lab-leak theory, the confidence-undermining pause on the  Johnson & Johnson  vaccine, and now encouraging alarmism with misleading claims about the number of Delta variant breakthrough cases. Despite this stream of inconsistent messages, these public-health authorities are routinely invoked by journalists and social-media fact checkers as the standard against which “Covid misinformation” is to be judged.<br />A year and a half of placing political expediency over scientific accuracy has taken its toll on the public. By failing to acknowledge the limitations of their own knowledge and repeated errors of judgment, Dr. Fauci and the CDC have undermined the very trust they seek to command. If public trust in science declines as a result, these officials have only themselves to blame.<br />Phillip W. Magness</td>

      <td>The temporary sale of government securities from the Federal Reserve’s vast holdings doesn’t affect deposit liabilities.</td>
      <td>Phil Gramm and Thomas R. Saving introduce their op-ed “How the Fed Is Hedging Its Inflation Bet” (Aug. 2) by stating a fact: “The growth of the M2 money stock fell from around 25% in 2020 to around 10% on an annualized basis in the first six months of 2021.” They then proceed to explain that this deceleration has occurred because the Fed has been able to drain “almost a trillion dollars of liquidity out of the financial system” since April via its reverse-repurchase facility. Their argument rests on faulty theory and doesn’t hold water.<br />The notion that a trillion dollars in reverse repos has reduced the money supply by even one dollar is nonsensical. Reverse repos are a liability of the Fed and an asset of the banks and money-market mutual funds (MMMF) that loan funds to the Fed via reverse repos. Deposit liabilities of both banks and MMMFs are constituents of the money supply. These liabilities remain unaffected by the choice banks and MMMFs make about whether to place their assets in the Fed’s reverse-repo facility, Treasury bills or elsewhere. Contrary to the Gramm-Saving analysis, the Fed’s reverse-repo program has no effect on the money supply.<br />John Greenwood<br />Chief economist, Invesco<br />London</td>

      <td>As people return to normal driving habits, insurers are seeing more accident losses—but they are also starting to look toward higher rates, too</td>
      <td>People are driving more, but many of them may also still be paying less for their car insurance.<br />Allstate  reported this week that its property-liability combined ratio increased to 95.7 in the second quarter, nearly six points higher than during the same quarter last year. This ratio rises as underwriting losses and expenses become a greater percentage of premiums collected—not what investors want to see. The uptick was aided by increasing auto-accident frequency relative to very depressed levels during the pandemic.<br />There could be more pressure from frequency, as trends aren’t yet fully normalized. Allstate said that auto property damage frequency for its branded insurance in the second quarter was up 47% from last year, but still was 21% lower than the same period of 2019.  Travelers  last month said that, while driving activity is close to pre-pandemic levels in most areas of the country, the mix of commuting and non-commuting driving was still different.<br />Yet insurers aren’t necessarily still seeing a commensurate benefit from fewer accidents. Allstate’s underlying combined ratio in its Protection auto business was 91.8, the same level as the second quarter of 2019—though still better than what it had been in 2017 and 2018. That is because frequency isn’t the only consideration. Insurers have noted that auto accidents that do happen are relatively severe, due in part to higher speeds, and that rising prices are making it more expensive to repair vehicles.<br />Those factors are mostly out of insurers’ control. But Allstate said that competitive pricing also was offsetting the favorable frequency trend. The upside for investors is that the industry seems to be acknowledging this dynamic and may yet avoid a damaging price war. Allstate said it was considering “targeted price increases” as necessary, and Travelers said it was considering how transitory auto cost rises might be as part of its pricing thinking.  Progressive  this week said rate increases took effect in 11 states in the second quarter.</td>

      <td>Professionals say young people setting up their own digs—as are many post-pandemic—tend to make similar decorating errors. Here’s what to do instead.</td>
      <td>AFTER 16 MONTHS cooped up with roommates or parents, young (and not-so-young) people have had enough. Those who can afford it are increasingly moving into their own first places when their leases end this summer and fall, said a spokesman for real-estate rental site StreetEasy. Searches that specified studio apartments are up 69% year-over-year.<br />When it comes to decorating these solo nests, however, designers say first timers’ greenness leads to errors: from cramming oafish sofas through doors they failed to measure to living sans civilities like curtains and rugs. As New York City designer Phillip Thomas said, “Just because it’s your first apartment doesn’t mean it can’t have a sense of sophistication.”<br />Here, design pros highlight the five flubs that novice renters most frequently make on their way to, as millennials call it, “adulting.” Plus: chic alternatives.<br />Generations of squished people have passed down various methods to separate a studio apartment into living and sleeping spaces: curtains, free-standing screens, bookshelves, even a delineating row of jungle-y plants. They all can make a space feel smaller, said Francesca Bucci, founder of BG Studio in Manhattan. Mr. Thomas noted that such barriers frequently cut off window light, creating a murky cave. “There is nothing more awful than living in a space without light,” he said.<br />Instead: Rather than placing your bed’s headboard against a wall, Ms. Bucci directed, “float” the bed, with the foot facing a window and leaving at least two feet of circulation at the bottom. A medium-height headboard will act as a divider without depriving the rest of the studio of natural light. Arrange your seating area on the other side of it, backing your couch against it. This way you won’t subject guests to your rumpled pillows or that stuffed animal from which you haven’t managed to brutally sever ties just yet.</td>

      <td>“Twice as many Jewish Americans say they derive a great deal of meaning and fulfillment from spending time with pets as say the same about their religion,” a Pew Research study finds. While the future of the Jewish people is uncertain, Jews can always count on Pew for provocative, and sometimes depressing, statistics about themselves.<br />In the organized Jewish community, all you have to say is “Pew.” Everybody gets the one-word reference—and knows it signifies danger ahead. Pew’s landmark 2013 study, “A Portrait of Jewish Americans,” sparked more arguments than there are Jews. But cited for years, the data lost their incendiary qualities as time went on. Fortunately, Pew has added kindling to the raging debate with “Jewish Americans in 2020,” a 248-page report based on interviews with 4,718 Jewish adults.<br />First, some good news: The global Jewish population appears to have returned to its pre-Holocaust level. Plus, from education to income and subjective well-being, U.S. Jews are doing swell. But these indicators are secular. They tell us nothing about how Jews are doing as Jews. That’s where the survey darkens.<br />Only 12% of American Jews attend weekly services. Progressives often counsel against despair, arguing that Jews express their Judaism through culture instead. From this emanates a different idea of an “involved” Jew: politics guided by Jewish values, participation in Jewish intellectual life, interest in the condition of the Jewish people, perhaps even nontraditional Shabbat or holiday observance. The Jewish future, the argument goes, can be less religious but no less Jewish.<br />Too bad that’s not realistic. “It’s not the case,” the study finds, “that Jewish cultural activities or individualized, do-it-yourself religious observances are directly substituting for synagogue attendance and other traditional forms of Jewish observance. More often, they are complementing traditional religious participation.” Drop traditional observance and Pew finds that the cultural engagement, measured along 12 metrics, collapses too.</td>

      <td>Everybody talks about the weather, but nobody does anything about it. That old quip, often attributed to Mark Twain or his friend Charles Dudley Warner, now guides most news coverage of severe weather. The media say that natural disasters are a result of climate change and we need to adopt radical policies to combat them.<br />But this framing tells only a small part of what is scientifically known. Take the recent flooding in Germany and Belgium, which many, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, are blaming on climate change. Yet a new study of more than 10,000 rivers around the world shows that most rivers now flood less. What used to be a 50-year flood in the 1970s happens every 152 years today, likely due to urbanization, flood-control measures, and changes in climate.<br />Some rivers still flood, and reporters flock there, but more scare stories don’t mean more global flooding. The river Ahr, where most of the German flood deaths occurred, had a spectacular flow on July 14, 2021, but it was lower than deadly flows in 1804 and 1910. The real cause of increased fatalities from riverine flooding in Germany and many other places is more people building settlements on flood plains, leaving the water no place to go. Instead of more solar panels and wind turbines to combat climate change, riverside communities need better water management. And foremost, they need a well-functioning warning system so they can evacuate before disaster strikes.<br />Here, Germany has failed spectacularly. Following the deadly European floods in 2002, Germany built an extensive warning system, but during a test last September most warning measures, including sirens and text alerts, didn’t work. The European Flood Awareness System predicted the floods nine days in advance and formally warned the German government four days in advance, yet most people on the ground were left unaware. Hannah Cloke, the hydrologist who set up the system, called it “a monumental failure.”<br />But of course, blaming the deadly floods on climate change instead of taking responsibility for the missed early warnings is convenient for politicians like Ms. Merkel, who, during a visit to Schuld, a devastated village on the Ahr, said, ”We must get faster in the battle against climate change.”</td>

They said the president was dead when the Colombians arrived, echoing testimony from some of the soldiers.<br />“It is our belief that the president’s own bodyguards betrayed him,” the lawyers wrote in a statement. It didn’t elaborate on why the bodyguards may have betrayed him.<br />The lawyers’ statement was accompanied by nearly 40 pages of private correspondence, contracts, a “Memorandum of Understanding” to replace Mr. Moïse with an obscure preacher, and an arrest warrant for the president. Together, the documents could shed more light on what happened in the early hours of July 7, when Haiti’s president was gunned down in the last few months of his term. The Biden administration has sent investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Homeland Security to help Haiti solve the case; officials from Colombia have also offered assistance.<br />More than 40 people including members of the slain president’s security detail, Haitian politicians, a convicted drug dealer turned Drug Enforcement Administration informant, a second longtime DEA informant and Miami-area businessmen have been detained or implicated in the case.</td>

      <td>Microsoft Corp.  co-founder Bill Gates said meeting with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was a “huge mistake” in an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper Wednesday.<br />Mr. Gates said he had several dinners with Mr. Epstein to discuss global health philanthropy, hoping his connections could help raise billions.<br />“When it looked like that wasn’t a real thing, that relationship ended,” said Mr. Gates during the “Anderson Cooper 360” program. “It was a huge mistake to spend time with him, to give him the credibility of being there.”<br />A spokeswoman for Mr. Gates said in 2019 he regretted meeting with Mr. Epstein, who died in jail in August 2019, awaiting trial on federal charges related to sex trafficking. In a September 2019 interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Gates said he met Mr. Epstein but “didn’t have any business relationship or friendship with him” and wasn’t aware of any donations from him.<br />The CNN interview comes two days after Bill and Melinda French Gates completed their divorce. The Journal previously reported Ms. French Gates was concerned by her former husband’s meetings with Mr. Epstein, with her concerns dating as far back as 2013. Mr. Gates didn’t respond directly to questions from Mr. Cooper about those reports from the Journal and the  New York Times .</td>

      <td>With a vegetable patch for the home chef and playful pathways for the kids, copious flowers for the aesthete and comfy perches where all can lounge, this California garden checks all the boxes. Here’s how it came together.</td>
      <td>THERE WAS was nothing you could call a yard,” recalled landscape designer Janell Denler Hobart of first visiting the San Anselmo, Calif., site where her clients, a young family, had recently bought a residence. The home’s main entrance opened onto a hillside that was extremely steep and utterly barren, said the designer, whose firm, Denler Hobart Gardens, is located in nearby Ross, Calif. “I think most people would have looked at it and thought ‘What can you possibly do here?’”<br />Happily, Ms. Denler Hobart was not deterred. Inspired by the owners, an accomplished landscape painter and a talented cook, she envisioned “a layered garden where the wife could work on her veggies, the school-age kids could explore, and the husband could have a spot to lounge.”<br />She started with a skeleton of hardscape elements dating to the 1939 construction of the French Mediterranean-style home, including a twisting stone staircase flanked by mature orange trees. She then introduced a mix of classical French design features—a parterre potager, or kitchen garden, espaliered fruit trees and geometric boxwood hedges—yielding a romantic landscape at once cultivated and dynamic. Inviting oases in which all ages can wander, gather, and play prove that a “family friendly” yard doesn’t need to be all lawn.<br />Here, five strategies to help homeowners recast a less-than-ideal plot into a welcoming haven.<br />Thanks to the quirks of the terrain, one of the yard’s primary outdoor seating areas—a grouping of chairs and table nestled against a wall covered in creeping fig and set among whimsical boxwood topiaries—sits in an unconventional location: directly across from the home’s front doors. Indeed, after the garden was completed, the homeowners staged a 40th birthday bash right there. “People have this reaction like ‘Can I really entertain here?’” said Ms. Denler Hobart. “But why not? It’s very welcoming and the perfect gathering place before setting off further to explore.” Potted evergreens, shorn into geometric sculptures, and a potted orange tree underplanted with million bells embrace the seating area to make it even more inviting.</td>

      <td>Many people use these college-savings plans. And they can be awfully confusing.</td>
      <td>Readers have a lot of questions about “529” college-savings plans.<br />After we published an article recently about these education-savings accounts, readers swamped us with questions—about how to withdraw funds for college, the impact on financial aid and more. (The plans can also be used for some K-12 tuition, but we focus mainly on the college use.)<br />Here are answers to some of the most-common questions we received.<br />It is almost time for my beneficiary to start college. What do I need to know about making withdrawals?<br />First, make sure you’ll be using the money for qualified expenses, such as tuition, room and board, books and supplies, and computers. Expenses that don’t qualify include things like transportation, campus parking, cellphones, club fees or dues, or furnishing a dorm room, according to the College Savings Plans Network, a repository for 529 plan data.</td>

      <td>Before you leave the house, don’t forget to take your phone, keys, wallet, mask—and some form of Covid-19 vaccine record.<br />New York City will require proof of vaccination for many indoor activities, such as dining, gyms and events, starting Aug. 16. Where I live in San Francisco, many bars require vaccine documentation for entry. (If you aren’t vaccinated, there are other reasons to consider it, beyond this new damper on your social life.)<br />Your phone can already replace most of your wallet: your subway pass, credit card, plane ticket, hotel keys and soon even your driver’s license. It’s a great place to store your Covid-19 vaccine record too.<br />Digital vaccine options vary from state-to-state. A national vaccine passport hasn’t taken off in the U.S., so states like California and New York are taking things into their own hands. However, going through a state-sponsored passport app probably isn’t necessary, as most establishments are likely to accept either your original CDC vaccine card or a digital scan or photo of it. Washington state’s guidance to businesses, for example, says “originals, copies or photographs on a mobile device are acceptable.”<br />In other words, before you venture out into the world, get your vaccine card on your phone. Then check to see if there are other passport apps that might make for quicker entry to your favorite spots. Here’s my quick guide:</td>

The effort will initially focus on combating ransomware and cyberattacks on cloud-computing providers, said Jen Easterly, director of the DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Ultimately, she said, it aims to improve defense planning and information sharing between government and the private sector.<br />“This will uniquely bring people together in peacetime, so that we can plan for how we’re going to respond in wartime,” she said in an interview. Ms. Easterly was sworn in as CISA’s director last month. She was previously a counterterrorism official in the Obama White House, and the commander of the Army’s first cyber operations unit at the National Security Agency, America’s cyberspy agency.<br />Over the past year, ransomware attacks have disrupted large parts of daily life in the U.S. They have diverted ambulances, caused long lines at gas stations in the southeast, and disrupted the production of hot dogs and other meat products.<br />Following a ransomware attack last month on cloud services provider Kaseya Ltd., President Biden warned Russian President Vladimir Putin that the U.S. would take “any necessary action” to protect its infrastructure from these incidents. Just days later, the administration blamed hackers affiliated with China’s Ministry of State Security for a separate set of attacks on users of Microsoft Exchange Server software.</td>

      <td>Lufthansa’s budget arm is doing better than its flagship airline, but low-cost operators still face stiff competition to fly a small number of unrestricted routes</td>
      <td>European investors who want to fly to Greek beaches this summer probably have more options than ever before. That is a reason to think twice before buying shares in the airlines taking them there.<br />On Thursday, German aviation group  Lufthansa  reported positive free cash flow for the first time since the pandemic’s onset, as well as confirming that second-quarter profits were in line with what analysts were expecting—an 850 million-euro loss, equivalent to about $1 billion. Almost all major European carriers have met or surpassed such forecasts as Covid-19 vaccines have charted a route back to economic normalcy.<br />However, that hasn’t given the stocks a lift: Lufthansa shares dropped more than 2% Thursday, and the airline subsector of the Stoxx Europe index is down 7% over the past three months. Only ultra-low-cost carriers  Ryanair  and  Wizz Air  are holding their own in the equity market—just—because they have the greatest ability to pivot quickly to the latest hot destinations, as travel rules change. Ryanair has more flights to Greece this summer than ever.<br />Sadly, there may be no foolproof way for investors to play the European summer reopening.<br />Lufthansa’s profits stayed on target due to its budget arm Eurowings. The unit reported operating losses 18% narrower than analysts projected, both as a result of short-haul demand bouncing back and the Covid-19 crisis allowing for the implementation of long-overdue cost reductions. By contrast, the flagship Network Airlines division did 12% worse than expected.</td>

Shares of  Tencent Holdings Ltd. , which has a sizable stake in the company, fell nearly 4% Thursday to its lowest close in more than a year.<br />Beijing-headquartered Kuaishou listed in February to much fanfare after raising $5.4 billion from global investors. The shares initially climbed, taking the company’s market capitalization to above $220 billion within days. It was down to about $48 billion on Thursday, according to FactSet.<br />Kuaishou recently removed a video-sharing app called Zynn from U.S. app stores and notified users that Zynn’s services would be terminated soon. In response to a query, a company spokesperson said the service will be discontinued by Aug. 20, and called the move a “normal operation adjustment” that wouldn’t affect the firm’s global strategy.<br />Zynn was rolled out in May 2020 and was a rival to privately held ByteDance’s hugely popular TikTok app. It drew controversy last year after some Internet users questioned Zynn’s offers to pay people to invite friends to join the platform.</td>

In the second quarter of 2020, the company’s revenue was $67 million. Moderna sold 199 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine in the latest quarter, for a total of 302 million doses so far this year.<br />The company, based in Cambridge, Mass., has been studying what form of booster shot could provide the best ongoing protection. In a Phase 2 study, a third shot of the original formulation, as well as shots with vaccine candidates with adjusted designs, all showed robust antibody responses against Covid-19 variants of concern, Moderna said.<br />A separate study has shown that protection from the two-dose regime remains more than 90% effective for at least half a year, the company said.<br />“We are pleased that our Covid-19 vaccine is showing durable efficacy of 93% through six months, but recognize that the Delta variant is a significant new threat so we must remain vigilant,” Chief Executive Stéphane Bancel said.</td>

      <td>Gensler wants to regulate digital assets to the same extent as stocks, bonds and commodity-related trading instruments</td>
      <td>Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler this week declared war on what he called the Wild West of crypto trading, promising a vigorous attack on fraud and misconduct. But progress is likely to be more piecemeal and incremental than wholesale and sudden.<br />Mr. Gensler outlined his desire to regulate digital assets such as bitcoin and other crypto products to the same extent as stocks, bonds and commodity-related trading instruments. He told the Aspen Security Forum on Tuesday that his priorities include newer innovations such as stablecoins and decentralized finance, products that are beginning to draw more mainstream investors.<br />The impulse to regulate these markets is growing more evident around the globe. Japan’s top financial regulator said Wednesday that plans to combat money laundering would also include digital currencies.<br />Mr. Gensler’s mission faces several obstacles, including the cryptocurrency industry’s historical resistance to following SEC rules. Because so many crypto developers have bypassed the SEC’s front door, the agency has tried to rein them in through enforcement, a slow process that requires investigating a particular product and either suing the team behind it or convincing them to settle and adopt the SEC’s requirements.<br />“There is going to be a more aggressive enforcement posture, and I think that is one way to bring order to chaos,” said Lee Schneider, a securities lawyer who has worked at several broker-dealers and cryptocurrency firms. “That is one way, but perhaps not the most effective or the most evenly distributed way.”</td>

      <td>You’re finally leaving your living room and are re-entering the dating market, but those spiffy outfits that served you so well pre-pandemic seem like overkill. Here, expert advice on dressing to connect in 2021.</td>
      <td>AFTER A YEAR in my apartment, I’ve changed my mind on a few things,” said Matthew Kehoe, 42, “one of which is dating attire.” Mr. Kehoe, a film producer in New York, is among the many single men re-entering the in-person dating game after months of relative isolation. But just as work, travel and socializing have evolved unpredictably since February of 2020, so too has the quest for a mate. That’s not necessarily a bad thing.<br />For starters, as men emerge from their quarantine caves into a wobbly world, splashy suit-and-tie formality no longer feels appropriate. “Now may not be the time to show off your brightest custom blazer or loudest Robert Graham print,” said Tammy Shaklee, a certified matchmaker and the founder of H4M Matchmaking. Ms. Shaklee finds casual dressing for dates refreshing and more “comfortable for a more subdued, face-to-face, getting-to-know-you type introduction.” In other words, after what we’ve been through, let’s be gentle with each other and avoid the sartorial pomp so prevalent in pre-pandemic dating.<br />That said, more relaxed attire does not mean dating itself has become any easier. The stakes are higher than ever. “I’m much more selective now,” said Mr. Kehoe. “I go on way fewer dates and they’re more important. When you think the world might end…you don’t want to go on a random date.” Imminent apocalypse aside, whether you’re a 20-something playing the field or a romance veteran getting back out there after a silver divorce, you’re re-entering the dating market at the same time as a lot of competitive men. If you can’t beat them in terms of net worth or looks, you’ll have to beat them with charm—and in the menswear arena. Here, five dating-style tips from experts and single guys. And before you ask: Yes, you do need to wear pants.<br />These days, gratuitous formality feels stuffy, affected and out of touch. “It’s more about being comfortable,” said Mr. Kehoe, referring to his post-lockdown dating attire. He believes that, when dressing for a date, you should put “your best foot forward,” but not project a disingenuous distortion of your real self. Before Covid, he would layer on a fashionable first-date veneer, wearing tucked-in button downs, Hermès belts and Gucci loafers. But that status-conscious strategy feels phony now that he spends most days in Converse sneakers, Levi’s and Grateful Dead T-shirts. “At the end of the day, they like you or they don’t, so why wear something you don’t [normally] wear?” Lately, Mr. Kehoe has adopted a dating uniform of jeans and T-shirts. He contends the just-laid-back-enough look establishes an unpretentious tone that’s “appreciated on the other side.”<br />Wool trousers, stiff khakis and anything reminiscent of pre-pandemic office attire are solidly out. Jeans, however, have never been more apropos. A considered pair telegraphs that you thought about your first-date look—but didn’t overthink it. The wrong pair, however, could inspire your date to escape through a bathroom window at risk of shredding her own outfit. Though advising on a wash is tricky, avoid anything overwrought or Twisted Sister-ish. Really focus on fit, said Greta Tufvesson, co-founder of bespoke matchmaking service the Bevy, which serves clients in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. “I don’t think a man should wear a baggy, long jean. It should be fitted around his legs and tailored to his correct inseam.” Ms. Tufvesson, who also approves of a rolled cuff, advises her clients to team their denim with a nice T-shirt (she champions navy Breton stripes this time of year) and toss a softly tailored jacket over the ensemble for a dressier look.</td>

But it positions Foxconn to jump into production of a certain kind of semiconductor that is quickly emerging as a leading technology in the electric-vehicle industry.<br />The six-inch wafers manufactured at the plant are used primarily for making car-chip components made of silicon carbide, a material that is regarded as offering better performance than traditional silicon for some tasks, such as fast charging. U.S. electric-vehicle maker  Tesla Inc.  began using silicon carbide components in 2018, making it one of the first in the industry.</td>

Workplace testing requirements and revised federal guidelines recommending that vaccinated people exposed to Covid-19 get tested could be adding to the demand.<br />Delayed results can hamper efforts to contain the spread of the virus and interfere with attendance at work, school or other activities that require proof of a negative test. Testing shortages and logjams complicated efforts to contain Covid-19 surges last year.<br />CVS Health Corp.  said Wednesday that demand for testing at its locations is now well above daily averages for this year. Meanwhile, at-home tests are among the company’s top-selling products in stores.<br />“People are obviously feeling symptoms and getting tested in greater numbers,” CVS Chief Executive Karen Lynch said in an interview. She said CVS has ample capacity to handle demand.</td>

But they are growing at a faster clip than their conventional counterparts, according to The Wall Street Journal’s analysis of data from SPAC Research.<br />Sixty new SPACs focused on emerging markets filed documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the first half of 2021, almost triple the number for all of 2020, according to the analysis. The number of non-emerging-market SPACs grew by about 67% to 515 over the same period.<br />The surge coincides with mounting competition that has driven up purchase prices, and a selloff that has buffeted the U.S. SPAC market in recent months.<br />SPACs are shell firms that raise money on stock exchanges, then merge with private companies and take them public. With so-many buyers chasing deals in the U.S., blank-check companies are more likely to overpay or to purchase speculative businesses because they must close deals within two years of launching or give investors their money back. The bidding wars have grown so heated that Wall Street insiders have taken to calling them SPAC-offs.</td>

      <td>Thermal-coal miner Glencore reported record first-half earnings and expects the fuel to be a big moneymaker for the rest of the year</td>
      <td>Miners are printing money from a business many are trying to exit: digging up thermal coal.<br />Prices for thermal coal, the variety burned to generate electricity, have shot to decade highs as supplies struggle to keep pace with demand from China and elsewhere during the global economic recovery. Analysts expect prices to stay elevated because concerns about the fuel’s contribution to climate change have made it increasingly difficult for miners to obtain permits or funding to dig more thermal coal out of the ground.<br />The rally is filling the pockets of miners including  Glencore  PLC,  Peabody Energy Corp.  and Australia’s  Whitehaven Coal Ltd.  The companies stuck with thermal coal despite pressure from environmentalists and Wall Street to abandon the fuel. The recent run-up in prices is also offering a parting gift to a clutch of miners, such as  BHP Group Ltd. , that are committed to leaving the energy-coal sector behind.<br />Glencore, the biggest producer of thermal coal for export by sea, on Thursday posted record earnings of $8.7 billion in the first six months of 2021, up 79% from a year earlier. A decline in coal production offset the effect of rising prices, which began to surge late in the first half, but Glencore said the coal market would be a big moneymaker for the rest of the year.<br />“For a responsible operator, you can still make decent money off these mines,” said Sean Munsie, a portfolio manager at South African investor Allan Gray, which is a large outside shareholder in Glencore.</td>

      <td>A big share buyback will help cushion the blow from disappointing results, but isn’t a strategy for the future</td>
      <td>A surprise share buyback from Japanese gaming champion  Nintendo  should help soothe investors who have held on as the stock dropped more than 10% this year.<br />Nintendo is clearly cash rich, but it needs to articulate a clearer vision for the future as the stay-at-home boost from the pandemic fades.<br />The Japanese game company on Thursday reported a 17% decline in operating profit for the quarter ending in June, while revenue dropped 10%—both lower than analysts’ estimates on S&P Global Market Intelligence. Nintendo’s profit decline isn’t a surprise given its exceptional performance last year due to stay-at-home demand. The company sold fewer of its Switch consoles and games during the quarter, compared with the same period last year. “Animal Crossing: New Horizons,” released in April last year, is one of its fastest-selling games. Component shortages also continue to be an issue in production and distribution of its consoles.<br />What surprised investors is Nintendo’s decision to spend up to ¥100 billion, the equivalent of $910 million, to buy back 1.51% of its own stock. Buybacks are rare for the Japanese company—last one was around ¥30 billion in 2019. Investors have long hoped Nintendo would improve its capital allocation. The company is sitting on around $10 billion of cash as well as nearly $6 billion of securities. Nintendo said its strong cash position, due to better-than-expected business from Switch, is the reason for the buyback. That seems to indicate it could just be a one-off since the boost from Covid-19 likely won’t be repeated.<br />The rare buyback will likely boost Nintendo’s share price in the short term, but the company needs to prepare for leaner times ahead too. The stock has dropped 14% this year, underperforming the broader Japanese market as well as peers such as  Sony .  One worry is the traditionally cyclical nature of the console business. The pandemic has probably prolonged the cycle, but the Switch console is likely past the middle, entering its fifth year. Growing Nintendo’s online business would help improve margins. Better use of its popular intellectual properties could also help diversify income sources.</td>

Equity markets can continue to climb by 5% to 10% over the next year, she said.<br />The continued signs of weakness in the labor market also suggests that the Federal Reserve will hold off on scaling back its easy money policies for now, Ms. Simmons added.</td>

      <td>Streaming star’s ad business delivers, but shortages remind why hardware still matters</td>
      <td>Investors got a painful reminder Wednesday that  Roku  is still in the hardware business.<br />It has been easy to forget. Roku may be best known to consumers for the TV sets and streaming boxes that bear its name, but advertising now makes up more than 80% of its total business. Advertising also is far more profitable, generating gross margins of 60% last year against 9% for the company’s hardware side. Roku’s business model has also made the company a Wall Street darling. The stock has surged 153% over the past 12 months and commands a multiple of more than 16 times forward sales—more than double that of  Netflix .<br />But there is no room for error. Roku’s second-quarter results reported Wednesday afternoon were strong in many important respects. Platform revenue reflecting the company’s advertising business more than doubled year over year to $532 million—handily beating Wall Street’s projections. But player revenue fell short, rising only 1% year over year to about $113 million. Moreover, player gross margins went negative for only the second time in the company’s history. Roku said it had elected to insulate customers from the cost increases related to the component shortages and shipping constraints afflicting many other makers of electronics products.<br />Roku’s share price slid more than 8% following the report. That dive might seem an overreaction, given the strength in the larger and more profitable ad side, but Roku’s hardware—which includes TV sets made by partners—serves as an important gateway to its platform. The company added 1.5 million active accounts during the quarter, the lowest growth in two years. Streaming hours over the Roku platform also slipped 5% from the first quarter—the first sequential decline for this metric on record.<br />Roku still inhabits an enviable position in the streaming wars. The company powers about 38% of streaming devices and connected TVs in the U.S., according to Parks Associates, representing a leading market share over platforms backed by tech titans  Amazon ,   Apple  and Google. That share provides valuable advertising real estate to tech and media giants pushing their own streaming services as well as other advertisers cutting back on traditional TV spending. Roku said Wednesday that it earned double the dollar commitment at this year’s Upfronts compared with last year. The company just needs to get enough devices in front of the eyeballs that advertisers are paying to reach.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. trade deficit likely widened to near a record in June as the resurgent American economy drove strong demand for foreign-made goods.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect a Commerce Department report Thursday to show that the deficit in goods and services widened to $74.2 billion in June from $71.2 billion in May. That would put the trade gap just shy of the record $75 billion in March.<br />American consumers and businesses have stepped up spending and investment as the economy has recovered to its pre-Covid-19 size, fueling demand for imports. Exports have grown more slowly, reflecting weaker recoveries in some other regions that have made less progress against the coronavirus.<br />The International Monetary Fund last week said that varying progress in vaccinations had created a fault line between countries with improving and deteriorating economic prospects. It raised its growth forecasts for the U.S. and other advanced economies with relatively high vaccination rates against Covid-19, while lowering the outlook for emerging-market countries where vaccination rates have lagged behind, especially in Asia.<br />That dynamic helps widen the U.S. trade deficit, as the American economy continues to pull in more goods from abroad. Several rounds of government stimulus payments have also left Americans with plenty of cash to spend, while weakened trade partners limit purchases of U.S. goods and services.</td>

Last week, five deals were withdrawn or canceled, the most since 2016, according to Dealogic.<br />The performance of newly listed shares also has been lackluster. So far this year, traditional U.S.-listed IPOs—not including special-purpose acquisition companies or direct listings—were up roughly 9% on average through Tuesday’s close, according to Dealogic, compared with a 15% gain for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index.

U.S.-listed traditional IPOs had raised more than $102 billion through Tuesday, on track to soon exceed any other full-year on record, according to Dealogic. In June and July alone, traditional IPOs raised more than $40 billion. But investors say the fast pace of IPO pitches has been exhausting, and they’re eager for a quieter August.

      <td>Ride-hailing company still expects to reach a measure of profitability by fourth quarter despite driver shortage, Delta variant concerns</td>
      <td>Uber Technologies Inc.’s  ridership rebounded strongly in the most recent quarter from last year’s pandemic lows, but a continuing driver shortage and uncertainty about how the Delta variant will affect consumer behavior pushed its shares lower.<br />The company said Wednesday its adjusted loss excluding tax, interest and some costs narrowed to $509 million in the second quarter from $837 million in the year-earlier period. Analysts polled by FactSet expected an adjusted loss before items of $322 million. Uber spent money in the quarter on incentives to woo drivers amid a shortage that has driven up passenger fares. Its shares fell more than 5% in after-hours trading.<br />Rival  Lyft Inc.  on Tuesday turned its first quarterly profit on that basis. The company hit that milestone a quarter earlier than expected, in part because ridership rebounded and it reined in costs.<br />Uber’s rides business is profitable by that measure, but its bottom line is dragged down by its capital-intensive food-delivery business. The company said it sees its loss by that measure narrowing to less than $100 million in the current quarter, and that it remains on track to post a profit by that measure by the fourth quarter.<br />Uber is among the companies that were both walloped by the pandemic, as cities went into lockdown and ridership plummeted, and benefited from people stuck at home turning in record numbers to food delivery. Easing pandemic restrictions boosted Uber’s rides business in the second quarter, but rising Covid-19 infections could damp prospects in the near-future.</td>

      <td>Where’s the uproar about the erosion of democratic norms?</td>
      <td>When Donald Trump took action that exceeded his authority, all of Washington erupted in protest. Yet that is exactly what President Biden did Tuesday, when his Administration reissued a nationwide eviction moratorium after the White House had argued at length that it lacked legal authority to do so. The Beltway response? Crickets.<br />“The bulk of the constitutional scholarship says that it’s not likely to pass constitutional muster,” Mr. Biden admitted Tuesday. That was only hours before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued its renewed eviction ban. “But at a minimum,” Mr. Biden said, “by the time it gets litigated, it will probably give some additional time while we’re getting that $45 billion out to people who are, in fact, behind in the rent and don’t have the money.”<br />Many Presidents have overstepped their authority, but this is premeditated lawlessness. The government has been slow to distribute pandemic relief funds to renters. Now to buy time and silence Democratic critics, Mr. Biden has signed off on an order that he admits he can’t defend in good faith.<br />The CDC’s original eviction ban, issued last September under President Trump, was extensively litigated before it expired on July 31. Five federal courts, including an appellate panel at the Sixth Circuit, ruled against it. A few courts went the other way, saying that landlords hadn’t met the burden required for a preliminary injunction. But the judicial score was lopsided against the moratorium.<br />In justifying the ban, the government cited the Public Health Service Act of 1944. To halt disease, that law says the CDC may require “inspection, fumigation, disinfection, sanitation, pest extermination,” and so forth, with a final catchall phrase for “other measures.” The feds argued this was enough legal authority. But the gap between “fumigation” and “other measures” isn’t big enough for the government to shove in a ban that applies to nearly every residence in America, punishable by a year in jail.</td>

      <td>His attempt at political accommodation invited the latest Biden abuse.</td>
      <td>Nearby we dissect the Biden Administration’s lawless new ban on rental evictions, and the episode has a lesson for the Supreme Court.<br />Key to the fiasco is a 5-4 Supreme Court order at the end of June. A lower court had ruled that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s nationwide eviction moratorium—then in effect without congressional authorization—was unlawful, but granted a stay pending appeal. Five High Court Justices agreed the CDC action wasn’t legally justified, but one of the five—Justice Brett Kavanaugh—offered a political olive branch.<br />Justice Kavanaugh agreed that the CDC “exceeded its existing statutory authority,” but he noted the agency “plans to end the moratorium in only a few weeks.” Therefore, he voted to leave the stay in place until the end of July, when the moratorium expired. He invited Congress to extend the moratorium through legislation if it wished. Congress failed.<br />Perhaps Justice Kavanaugh hoped his June concession on the law would improve governance. He wrote that “those few weeks will allow for additional and more orderly distribution of the congressionally appropriated rental assistance funds.” But that’s not the judiciary’s job. It’s the responsibility of the executive branch and state governments.<br />The Biden Administration responded to Justice Kavanaugh’s concession first by blaming him for saying the ban is illegal and then reinstating it anyway. So much for returning the favor. Meanwhile, Congress and state legislatures continue to evade political responsibility for their decisions on rental policy.</td>

      <td>The Senate’s 2,700-page infrastructure bill is a major step toward climate central planning.</td>
      <td>The press corps seems bored with the Senate’s 2,700-page infrastructure bill since it’s destined to pass. But the bill is more consequential than the coverage, and one theme in particular deserves more attention. The bill is a major down payment on President Biden’s Green New Deal.<br />The Senate bill is a great leap forward for progressive ambitions to use central planning to re-engineer the electrical grid and banish carbon from the U.S. economy. The bill helps this political medicine go down by offering large subsidies that have co-opted the business lobbies.<br />Start with the $21.5 billion for the Energy Department’s new Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, otherwise known as Secretary Jennifer Granholm’s green-energy venture-capital fund. Ms. Granholm knows this territory, having made many failed renewable-energy bets as Governor of Michigan—including A123 Systems, Fisker Automotive and various solar manufacturers.<br />Now she will get tens of billions of dollars to bet on even more energy projects. This includes $2.4 billion for advanced nuclear reactor projects, $3.5 billion for carbon capture, $8 billion for “clean hydrogen” and $5 billion for projects that “demonstrate innovative approaches to transmission, storage, and distribution infrastructure to harden and enhance resilience and reliability.”<br />Government bureaucrats will decide what counts as “innovative.” This isn’t betting solely on pure research that the private economy won’t do. It’s backing specific technologies and business models. But if projects are innovative, why do they need government investment? Start-ups are receiving record amounts of private capital as institutional investors seek higher returns.</td>

      <td>China is now purging Hong Kong teachers who resist its propaganda.</td>
      <td>China wants the world to forget about its political takeover of Hong Kong, but we’ll try to keep you as informed as we can. The latest news is the imposition of a Communist Party-friendly curriculum in the city’s schools.<br />On Saturday the Education Bureau said it will no longer recognize the Hong Kong Professional Teachers’ Union, which has 95,000 members and is more a guild than a union in the American sense. The Education Bureau says the union has been “engaging in political propaganda under the guise of being a professional education organisation.” But authorities’ real fear is that teachers will resist imposing Beijing’s “patriotic education” on Hong Kong students.<br />The new national security law directs Hong Kong to “promote national security education in schools and universities.” The Education Bureau is revamping the curriculum so students develop “a sense of belonging to the country, an affection for the Chinese people, a sense of national identity, as well as an awareness of and a sense of responsibility for safeguarding national security.” Public libraries have removed the books of pro-democracy figures.<br />Thus the purge of teachers. Authorities took particular issue with the union’s longtime alliance with groups that organized peaceful pro-democracy protests and annual Tiananmen vigils. Authorities have warned teachers and students that political expression in classrooms or on campus may violate the national security law. The maximum penalty is life in prison.<br />In May the union reported that nearly one in five teachers surveyed said they planned to leave the profession. Most said the reason was “increased political pressure.”</td>

      <td>General Motors, Ford and Stellantis are expected to commit to the electric-vehicle target at the White House on Thursday</td>
      <td>Auto makers including  General Motors Co. ,  Ford Motor Co.  and Jeep maker  Stellantis  NV will aim to make electric vehicles account for 40% to 50% of their U.S. sales by 2030, according to people familiar with the matter, who said the targets would be announced at the White House on Thursday.<br />Other auto makers are expected to separately make similar announcements regarding sales targets for electric vehicles as consumers begin warming to EVs and as auto manufacturers lay heavy bets on the new technology, the people said.<br />“This industry’s going to spend $330 billion over the next five years on electrification alone,” said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the lobbying group for auto makers and suppliers, at a conference Wednesday. “Even in Washington, D.C., that is real money.”<br />Even so, the sales targets are predicated on increased support from federal and local governments such as increasing the availability of charging and providing purchase subsidies, the people said. Federal lawmakers are proposing up to $7.5 billion for states and municipalities to build electric-vehicle charging stations as part of the infrastructure bill moving through the Senate.<br />Along with the electric-vehicle targets, auto industry officials expect the White House to announce rules mandating a 3.7% annual increase in fuel efficiency for the next two years. The White House and other federal officials declined to comment on the fuel targets.</td>

      <td>Ride-hailing companies have spent dearly to compete for the same riders; now they are spending to compete for the same drivers</td>
      <td>Is the optimal strategy in ride-hailing growth or profits? Investors can’t have it both ways.<br />After  Lyft  said it achieved profitability on the basis of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization on Tuesday, Uber said Wednesday that its losses deepened sequentially on that basis as it made investments in driver recovery. Shares of Lyft fell more than 9% the day after its report while Uber’s shares fell 8% in after-hours trading immediately following the release of its second quarter results.<br />Investors have become uncomfortable with ride-hailing companies paying dearly to compete for the same riders as they work to grow their market share. Now they are paying to compete for the same drivers as they work to rebuild their supply after the pandemic decimated ride-hailing demand.<br />They may not be investing equally. Lyft said it significantly increased its investments in incentives and sign-on bonuses to boost its driver base in the second quarter, expecting elevated incentives to continue into the third quarter. But Uber appears to have been more aggressive. While the company reported overall revenue that beat Wall Street’s estimate, it also lost 58% more than analysts had forecast on an adjusted Ebitda basis.<br />At this point, it is still unclear which company’s investment strategy is yielding the most bang for its buck. Lyft said its rideshare rides in the second quarter were still “well below” the levels reached in the fourth quarter of 2019. While not a perfect comparison, Uber’s second quarter trips—a reflection of both supply and demand—were down just over 20% from the same period.</td>
