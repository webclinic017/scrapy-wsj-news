      <td>The President is withholding rocket launchers and won’t help with food exports.</td>
      <td>Sometimes it’s hard to tell if President Biden and his strategists want Ukraine to win its defensive war against Russia, or merely survive to sign a truce with more of its former territory under Russian control. That ambivalence is returning as an issue as Russian forces make new military gains in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.<br />On Monday Russian troops moved into the center of Severodonetsk, one of the last major Ukrainian strongholds in the Donbas, which is the industrial heart of the country. The advances followed relentless artillery and rocket barrages on the city that resemble the destruction of Mariupol.</td>

Alaska’s Pebble Mine project is the latest to join the casualty list.<br />The Pebble site holds an estimated $300 billion to $500 billion in mineral resources and could be one of the world’s largest suppliers of copper and gold. Electric cars as well as wind and solar power require enormous amounts of copper. Investors have invested nearly $1 billion on exploration, engineering and studies to meet regulatory demands.</td>

But after Sunday’s first round in the presidential election, the country of 51 million is tilting toward the left-wing populism that has harmed so many Latin nations.<br />Former M-19 guerrilla Gustavo Petro finished first with 40% of the vote, short of the majority required to avoid a runoff on June 19. His opponent will be Rodolfo Hernández, a successful businessman and former mayor of Bucaramanga (2016-2019), who finished second with 28%. An eccentric 77-year-old with little fixed ideology, Mr. Hernández surged late in the race with the skillful use of TikTok while campaigning as an outsider against corrupt elites.</td>

      <td>One big question facing the North Atlantic alliance after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is whether Germany is serious about Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s pledge to rearm Europe’s largest country. An answer of sorts emerged Sunday evening, and allies will be somewhat reassured.<br />Mr. Scholz in late February promised rearmament after 30 years of underinvestment in the German military. The centerpiece of his “turning point” in foreign policy was a twin commitment to create a €100 billion ($108 billion) special fund for defense procurement and to spend 2% of gross domestic product on defense in line with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization goal.</td>

      <td>Simply by issuing hassle-free visas, Western countries can crimp the Russian economy and help themselves.</td>
      <td>As the war in Ukraine rages on, Western leaders are struggling to find ways to weaken Russia without risking escalation or harming themselves economically. But a labor-market policy toward Belarus offers one solution: Issue hassle-free tech-worker visas.<br />Poland’s tech sector has been thriving so much that it’s in dire need of workers. Many Poles with tech experience are being snapped up by companies in Europe and even in the U.S. The Polish government’s website offers an extraordinarily friendly welcome: “Are you an engineer or do you have experience in the IT sector? Are you considering relocating to Poland? We will help you fast-track the immigration procedure, allowing you to enter Poland together with your family.” The welcome is part of a Polish-government launch last year that saw the country inviting Belarusian tech experts to meet its demand for tech workers. When the visa was launched, Poland had a shortage of about 50,000 tech workers, with the number expected to double within the next 10 years if nothing is done.</td>

But a much smaller Ukrainian force resolutely repelled Russia’s attack on and around Kyiv and it continues to stymie Russian forces with small infantry units equipped with modern weapons, the latest training, the best intelligence and the courage of troops fighting for freedom.<br />Most commentators have been surprised, but Ukraine’s successful principles are the same as those in the U.S. Marine Corps’ plan to modernize.

It was a clear statement of American national strategy that will be closely read by foreign ministries and leaders around the world. Since 1945, Mr. Blinken said, America and its allies have built a global order that has to a large degree kept the peace and promoted the well-being of people around the world.

Greg Abbott pointed out, 18-year-olds have been able to buy long guns for over 60 years. Yet schools, churches, movie theaters and grocery stores were not getting shot up as they are today. I also remember saying the Pledge of Allegiance in school, going to church, obeying my teachers and respecting the police. There were no first-person-shooter videogames and there was a lot less violence in the media. My parents and grandparents expected respect, civility and courtesy.<br />The erosion of cultural norms together with the deinstitutionalization of those with drug problems and mental illness lays bare what happens when a society takes down the guardrails of civil behavior.

      <td>This year’s price increase in solar panels is due to supply-chain snafus, not tariffs.</td>
      <td>Regarding your editorial “Biden’s Solar Tariff Brawl” (May 23) and T.J. Rodgers’s op-ed “Tariffs Throw Shade on the Solar Industry” (May 25): Since antidumping and countervailing duties were instituted in 2012 and 2014, and “safeguard” tariffs in 2018, growth in the U.S. solar industry has outpaced all projections while prices fell. U.S.-based solar manufacturing grew strongly, accounting for nearly 20% of U.S. consumption. This year’s price increase in solar panels is due to supply-chain snafus, shipping-cost increases and excessive dependence on Asian supplies, not tariffs.<br />Experience since 2018 shows that a simple, comprehensive tariff policy limiting the penetration of subsidized Chinese solar products can support the healthy growth of the U.S. industry. But Chinese solar manufacturers, led and orchestrated by the Communist Party, are resourceful. They now rely on facilities in Southeast Asia to evade U.S. tariffs. The U.S. solar installers who want to make the U.S. dependent on cheap Chinese solar equipment—manufactured with slave labor and produced with coal-fired electricity—are playing into the hands of the Chinese government.</td>

It should be recognized, however, that such shameless use of one’s expert reputation is not limited to former government officials.<br />Consider a recent example from academia: In September 2021, 17 winners of the Nobel Prize in economics issued an open letter in support of the massive, $4 trillion to $5 trillion Build Back Better bill, claiming that it would lower inflation in the long run. Just imagine what our current short-run inflation problems would be if this bill had been enacted.

That’s how we got Covid vaccines and therapies in record time. What’s rotten is that applications for new uses of generic drugs are reviewed under different standards than those for novel treatments. That’s what the FDA did this month when it rejected a Covid emergency-use authorization (EUA) application by doctors for the antidepressant fluvoxamine.<br />The media has derided some doctors as quacks for advocating off-label drugs like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin. Early in the pandemic studies suggested the two anti-parasite drugs could be beneficial. David Boulware, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Minnesota, helped lead four of those trials.

With kids having sacrificed so much in the fight against Covid, a disease that primarily harms those much older, it’s time for society to get students back on track.<br />As it turns out, there’s a way to improve student learning that even sullen teenagers won’t complain about: Give them financial incentives to study hard.</td>

One of these is warm fuzzies—feel-good senses associated with a firm’s product. Customers like warm fuzzies and are willing to pay for them. If the cost of providing warm fuzzies in the product bundle is lower than the additional revenue they bring in, a profit-making firm provides them. Unless the firm can explain how the mission is reducing its profits, its ESG mission can be understood as business as usual. Missions that increase profits aren’t best seen as missions.<br />David Colander</td>

Today remote work is a white-collar norm.<br />“If you take the U.S. as a whole,” says Edward Glaeser, chairman of Harvard’s economics department, office attendance is “down about 19%, relative to pre-pandemic levels.” That average masks some startling variations among major cities.

Russian troops recently moved past Berdichev, 125 miles southwest of Kyiv, where Conrad was born in 1857, and nearby Zhitomir, where he lived as a young child. Raised in Ukraine by Polish parents, Conrad grew up under Russian rule. In his boyhood the local society was composed of Russian civil servants, Polish landowners, Jewish merchants and Ukrainian peasants.<br />After Conrad’s father Apollo was implicated in the Polish revolution suppressed by Russia in 1863, he and his family were exiled to the harsh climate and brutal life of Vologda, a penal town 250 miles northeast of Moscow. Conrad had a harrowing relationship with his gloomy and guilt-ridden father who exercised a profound effect on his life. Apollo’s political essay “Poland and Muscovy” (1864) described Russia’s century-old oppression of Poland and condemned Russia as the “terrible, depraved, destructive embodiment of barbarism and chaos,” as “the plague of humanity” and as “the negation of human progress.” Apollo believed that Catholic, democratic Poland was historically destined to protect Western Europe from the pitiless hordes of Moscow. Conrad adored his patriotic father but disliked Apollo’s disastrous politics that had traumatized his childhood and believed the pursuit of revolution was futile and destructive. In his teens, Conrad fled from the morbid atmosphere of Polish martyrdom to the freedom of England and life at sea.</td>

That was a bit more than economists had estimated, and came on top of an upward revision to the March spending figures. Notably, spending continues to outpace inflation—the Commerce Department said that its measure of inflation (which is the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge) rose 0.2% in April from a month earlier.</td>

      <td>Maduro wants concessions but has zero interest in free and fair elections.</td>
      <td>Two unnamed senior Biden administration officials told reporters this month that the U.S. intends to ease sanctions that prohibit American companies from engaging with the Venezuelan oil industry. The Trump administration established those sanctions in 2019 and tightened them in 2020 as part of an effort to pressure the military dictatorship in Caracas to release political prisoners and hold free and fair elections.<br />Yet the regime hasn’t even agreed to sit down at the proposed negotiating table in Mexico. What looks like a Biden concession with no quid-pro-quo has alarmed democracy advocates all over the Western Hemisphere—and especially in South Florida. They’re worried that the U.S. is tiptoeing toward a rapprochement with dictator Nicolás Maduro that will abandon the cause of Venezuelan freedom. (For the record, independent oil analysts say that Venezuela, with or without  Chevron ,  isn’t capable of making a dent in lost Russian oil production any time soon.)</td>

The disruption of supply chains caused by the shortage of chips for the auto industry, which affected the jobs of millions of U.S. workers, crystallizes the importance of Taiwan’s role. Bringing Taiwan to the IPEF will enhance the resilience of the global supply chain, secure America’s supply of strategic components and create jobs for U.S. workers.</td>

      <td>The cost reduction overcomes the energy loss.</td>
      <td>A letter (May 10) questions the savings from E15 gasoline (gasoline blended with 15% ethanol) versus mainstream E10 gasoline, claiming that reductions in miles per gallon with E15 will exceed cost savings. I have studied the impact of fuel composition on engine operation for decades. It’s correct that E15 contains less energy than E10, around 1.5% less. But assuming gasoline at $4 a gallon, this reduction in energy would be overcome by cost reduction when E15 gasoline costs 6 cents or more per gallon less than E10.<br />Savings with E15 generally far exceed 6 cents a gallon compared with E10, producing a welcome reduction in operating cost per mile for consumers. Moreover, the 1.5% penalty with E15 is a worst-case scenario. Octane enhancement with E15 coupled with reduced intake temperature (heat of vaporization) typically offsets some of the 1.5% reduction in fuel economy. Finally, energy security from an American homegrown fuel, coupled with greenhouse-gas-emissions reductions, further support E15 as the preferred choice.</td>
