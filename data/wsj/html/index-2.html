      <td>A Homeland Security official’s appointment to the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol has generated criticism from current and former government officials because of his role overseeing a DHS intelligence office that didn’t act on warning signs.<br />Joseph Maher, a senior department attorney who was recently appointed to the staff of the new House select committee, last year oversaw the department’s Office of Intelligence of Analysis. That office is tasked with monitoring social media for threats and failed to warn law-enforcement agencies of a possible assault after the office scaled back its monitoring of online chatter in the lead-up to Jan. 6.<br />The Jan. 6 panel intends to investigate that office, along with other intelligence agencies, over information-sharing ahead of the assault on the Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters.<br />Mr. Maher’s addition to the committee staff has upset some DHS officials, who have privately called for his removal, according to a department official. Outside government, some are publicly calling for Mr. Maher to be removed from the committee.<br />“He should be a witness on what did & didn’t happen at DHS leading up to & on Jan. 6. Full stop,” Olivia Troye, a Trump-era White House homeland security official, said on Twitter.</td>

      <td>The closely held European-based companies behind Fifty Shades of Grey vibrators and other sexual wellness brands said they have agreed to merge in a deal that values the combined company at around $1.2 billion, amid increasing global demand for sex toys fueled in part by the pandemic.<br />Germany’s WOW Tech Group is combining with Lovehoney, a U.K.-based online retailer, to offer a range of sex toys, lingerie, and lubricants to retailers and consumers. The companies could officially announce the tie-up as soon as Thursday.<br />The deal comes as homebound consumers during pandemic-induced lockdowns spurred demand for sexual wellness products. Together, WOW Tech and Lovehoney, which will be known as the Lovehoney Group, will be profitable and expect to generate sales of more than $400 million this year. That is about double the combined 2020 level, making it the world’s largest sexual wellness company measured by revenue, they say.<br />The merger, which values the combined group at more than €1 billion, equivalent to $1.2 billion, represents a bet that the sector’s growth can continue even as the rollout of vaccines allows more people to leave their homes and socialize in groups. Lovehoney Group will operate across North America, Europe and Asia, offering brands such as We-Vibe, Womanizer, and Arcwave. The companies are also betting on the additional scale allowing them to seek bigger acquisitions.<br />“Sexual well-being products have gained a mainstream position in today’s market,” said Johannes Plettenberg, WOW Tech’s current chief executive. He will continue in that role at Lovehoney Group.</td>

      <td>Real average hourly earnings have declined for seven months.</td>
      <td>The meaning of “transitory” is getting longer all the time. That’s one conclusion from the Labor Department’s report Wednesday for July that consumer prices rose 5.4% over the last 12 months. That’s two months in a row, after a 5% annual increase in May. When does transitory, in the Federal Reserve’s inflation lingo, become persistent?<br />White House economists looking for silver price linings can note that the monthly increase in the consumer-price index slowed in July to 0.5% compared to 0.9% in June. But the smaller increase was mostly due to used car prices stabilizing somewhat after months of astronomical growth. Inflation rose anyway.<br />Notably, the “core” CPI that strips out volatile energy and food prices increased 0.3% in July and 4.3% over the last 12 months. Prices last month rose for most goods and services including toys (0.4%), pet products (1.4%) and haircuts (2.2%). Rents climbed (0.4%) and have been accelerating.<br />Food prices surged 0.7% while restaurant meals rose 0.8%, the most since 1981. None of this is any surprise to Americans who have visited a supermarket or eaten out lately. Labor costs are rising as businesses have to raise wages to attract workers who can make more unemployed. The result: Higher prices.<br />The worker shortage is also contributing to supply-chain problems and raising rates for shipping, as well as causing delays in getting products to customers. Rising energy prices are feeding into higher production and transportation costs and ultimately consumer prices.</td>

      <td>A Chinese court sentenced Canadian businessman Michael Spavor to 11 years in prison on Wednesday. Beijing says he’s a spy, but Mr. Spavor is really the latest victim of the Communist Party’s hostage diplomacy.<br />Chinese police arrested Mr. Spavor and former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig in December 2018. They had the bad luck to be in China 10 days after Canada arrested Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at U.S. request as she traveled through Vancouver. The U.S. alleges that she committed bank and wire fraud, which Ms. Meng denies.<br />In May 2020 a Canadian judge ruled that the charges against her could be considered crimes in the U.S. and Canada. Less than a month later, China charged Messrs. Spavor and Kovrig with espionage. The timing of Mr. Spavor’s sentence is also no coincidence, with an extradition decision for Ms. Meng near. The vague language of the sentencing pronouncement hinted that China may be willing to expel Mr. Spavor, which is one more sign that his arrest was political.<br />In a statement Wednesday, Marc Garneau, Canada’s minister of foreign affairs, condemned Mr. Spavor’s sentence and said the decision was “rendered after a legal process that lacked both fairness and transparency.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for the immediate release of the two Canadians and said that “people are not bargaining chips.”<br />They are in China. Neither the U.S. nor Canada can submit to this human blackmail, or it will happen any time a well-connected Chinese national is accused of breaking one of their laws. The countries will have to let the legal process play out while making clear how dangerous it now is to do business in China.</td>

      <td>The White House pleads for more foreign oil. The U.S.? Not so much.</td>
      <td>We thought we’d seen everything, but there it was Wednesday morning in black and white on the White House website: Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, imploring the cartel of oil exporting nations to pump more oil. Talk about a political climate change. This is the same Biden Administration that has spent six months doing everything it can to crush U.S. oil production.<br />“Higher gasoline costs, if left unchecked, risk harming the ongoing global recovery. The price of crude oil has been higher than it was at the end of 2019, before the onset of the pandemic,” Mr. Sullivan’s statement said. “While OPEC+ recently agreed to production increases, these increases will not fully offset previous production cuts that OPEC+ imposed during the pandemic until well into 2022. At a critical moment in the global recovery, this is simply not enough.”<br />Someone pass the smelling salts to Tom Steyer, the climate crusader who surely fainted when he heard that one. Oil production is beneficial? Fossil fuels are essential to economic growth? The world needs more petroleum to be burned to release more CO2 into the atmosphere?<br />Perhaps Mr. Sullivan missed Monday’s U.N. report that the world will soon be as hot as Hades if we keep pumping oil. In a single, brief statement, he managed to contradict President Biden’s entire energy message as a candidate and in office. But as it happens, Mr. Sullivan wasn’t talking out of his hat.<br />On Wednesday Brian Deese, the White House economic council chief, wrote to the Federal Trade Commission to investigate oil-price fluctuations. This is a hardy perennial whenever White House officials fret that rising gasoline prices are becoming an issue. Blame “anti-competitive” practices. Perhaps Mr. Deese found the letter in a White House file cabinet. This means inflation is showing up as a bigger political problem in the polls than Democrats let on.</td>

      <td>The same coronavirus media alarmism that worked against Donald Trump in 2020 is now eroding support for Gavin Newsom.</td>
      <td>Following a year of stay-at-home orders, crushing job losses and long-running school closures, the big question on Californians’ minds right now is whether Gov. Gavin Newsom will be recalled. A Survey USA poll of 11,000 people at the beginning of August found that 51% of Golden State voters would vote to remove the first-term Democrat. California’s recall election takes place on Sept. 14, with voters first choosing whether to recall the governor, and then selecting one of 46 candidates to succeed Mr. Newsom.<br />Incumbent politicians are usually only recalled when people are really unhappy, and looking back over the past year, Californians’ ire is obvious. In a video shared widely on social-media platforms in December, Angela Marsden, owner of the Pineapple Hill Saloon and Grill in Sherman Oaks, said, “[Los Angeles] Mayor Garcetti and Gavin Newsom are responsible for every single person that doesn’t have unemployment, that does not have a job, and all the businesses that are going under.”<br />Today the frustration continues, as masks return and everyone—including those who’ve been vaccinated—are advised to wear them indoors in areas of high transmission. And while Sacramento’s guidelines aren’t legally binding, cities like Los Angeles are mandating mask use indoors. Gov. Newsom blames the unvaccinated: “We’re at a point in this epidemic . . . where choice, individuals’ choice not to get vaccinated, is now impacting the rest of us in a profound and devastating and deadly way,”<br />In one of life’s ironies, the same coronavirus media alarmism that worked against Donald Trump in 2020 is now eroding support for Mr. Newsom. The hunter has become the hunted. And young people’s attitudes are changing. “The disease isn’t a big risk to them but they’re having to give up senior proms, 21st birthdays,” says Jillian Melchior, a Journal opinion page writer. “They’re having to spend their first year of college in their mom’s basement in front of a computer screen, and I really think some of them are going to resent this.”<br />Also frustrating for many voters is Gov. Newsom’s grandstanding on climate change. “This climate change is real,” he said on a tour of damage done by the Tamarack Fire in Douglas County, Nev., with Gov. Steve Sisolak, before taking a shot at anyone who might disagree: “You may not believe in science. You’ve got to believe your own damn eyes. Look around.” Most people accept that the climate is changing, but many also believe the fires across California are the result of poor forestry management. And periodic blackouts occur because the state’s mandates and subsidies for solar and wind power have left energy supplies short when it’s especially hot, a fact Mr. Newsom admitted in Aug. 2020: “Today we are anticipating substantially greater need for energy, roughly 4,500 megawatts, 4,400 to be precise, short, of where we believe we need to be.”</td>

      <td>They’ve wrecked the cities and the border. Why would climate policy be different?</td>
      <td>Notwithstanding that we are passing the 18th month of a global Covid-19 pandemic that has killed 4.3 million people and crushed national economies, the United Nations decided that what the world needs just now is more bad news, as summarized by the  New York Times : “The new report leaves no doubt that humans are responsible for global warming, concluding that essentially all of the rise in global average temperatures since the 19th century has been driven by nations burning fossil fuels, clearing forests and loading the atmosphere with greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane that trap heat.” What’s more, the report says climatic destruction is going to get worse no matter what we do. I do sometimes wonder what it would be like to be alive when the world ends.<br />The U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change even includes an interactive atlas depicting that global warming’s ruin will be everywhere, meaning there’s nowhere to hide. Now what?<br />My short answer: Don’t put the Democrats in charge of Noah’s Ark. It will sink.<br />If only for the sake of discussion, let’s stipulate the U.N.’s climate report may be right that warming is a problem. One still may pose a practical political question: Instead of mitigating the world’s climate challenge, what evidence exists that these progressive advocates—Democratic politicians or affiliated scientists—would do anything other than make it worse if we put them in charge of the solutions?<br />The currently observable reality is that progressives, who have now captured the Democratic Party at all levels of government, don’t seem able to run anything anymore—not cities, not Covid, not a national border. Why would letting them run climate policy be different?</td>

      <td>A history of Chinese labor and immigration in the United States, South Africa and Australia, from the 1850s to the present.</td>
      <td>In 1871, a Chinese immigrant named Chung Sun came to California with $600, hoping to establish a tea plantation. But shortly after his arrival in Los Angeles, a mob of hundreds stormed the city’s Chinatown. Though beaten and robbed, Chung Sun was among the more fortunate; as many as 19 of his countrymen died in the riot, some of them lynched from makeshift gallows. While educated and fluent in English, in the wake of the unrest Chung Sun could find work only as a ditch digger, and the sunny optimism that had lured him to America soon melted away. In short order he returned to his homeland, but not before publishing several letters in a local newspaper. As he explained in one missive: “In civility, complaisance, and polite manners, [Americans] are wholly wanting and are very properly styled barbarians.”<br />If the anti-Chinese violence that erupted sporadically in the United States after 1850—from the Pacific Coast to the Mountain West—was of a particularly brutal nature, historian Mae Ngai argues in her new book that the prejudice experienced by individuals like Chung Sun was sadly typical across the Anglo-American world during the global gold rush of the second half of the 19th century. Faced with an aggregate influx of more than 300,000 Chinese newcomers, various white settler societies grappled with what the book describes eponymously as “The Chinese Question,” which Ms. Ngai summarizes this way: “Were Chinese a racial threat to white, Anglo-American countries, and should Chinese be barred from them?” The answer to that query “played a central part in the making of white settler identity and the modern nation-state,” while bringing about “a new way of imagining, organizing, and governing the world.”<br />This is not the book Ms. Ngai set out to write. Instead, she began with a more circumscribed plan to “slay the coolie myth,” the tenacious if largely erroneous notion that Chinese laborers of this era were merely indentured servants—“slavish, without personality or will, and pathetically oppressed.” This idea took hold during the 19th-century Chinese diaspora, promulgated especially by white laborers in places such as California. These objections of the working class were rooted not in any humanitarian concern for the supposedly exploited Chinese; rather—as with their hostility to African-American chattel slavery (to which “coolieism” was often compared)—white Americans and European immigrants focused on the perceived injury to their own economic prospects, which they believed would suffer from competition with unfree workers. Cynical politicians mobilized this animosity to great effect. John Bigler, the third governor of California, won re-election in 1853 by leaning into the Chinese Question.<br />In the course of her research, however, Ms. Ngai uncovered striking parallels between the California gold rush and a pair of other mining frontiers in Australia and South Africa—both in geographical conditions and the process of indigenous dispossession that preceded resource extraction. But of much greater interest to the author is that all three societies “ultimately answered the Chinese Question with legislation excluding Chinese from immigration and citizenship,” including the so-called White Australia Policy (1901-73) and a general program of Chinese exclusion in South Africa (1880s-1980s). Likely more familiar to American readers is the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which, for the first time in U.S. history, used race as the basis for barring an entire group of immigrants; the law remained in effect until 1943. As Ms. Ngai explains, the issue of Chinese exclusion shifted the U.S. federal position on immigration from a matter of commerce to one of national security, where it resides today.<br />This is a work of towering ambition, which led Ms. Ngai—who teaches at Columbia University and is the author of two previous books, including an acclaimed study of illegal aliens in American history—to scour archives on five continents and to familiarize herself with several national histories to complement her primary expertise in U.S. history. There is good reason that many professional and popular historians opt for more narrowly drawn accounts of discrete events or individuals. But the payoffs of Ms. Ngai’s comparison are notable, among them the challenge to American exceptionalism as well as the illumination of key differences between her case studies. To wit: “Chinese enjoyed more favorable legal and social conditions” in Australia than in California, and in South Africa “the Native Question—the problem of how whites could control and exploit the Black majority”—loomed at all times over the Chinese Question (and everything else).</td>

      <td>Government shields its employees and beneficiaries, but not ordinary workers, from higher prices.</td>
      <td>The Labor Department reported Wednesday that consumer prices have risen in the past year by 5.4%. Prices have risen at an annualized rate of 7.1% in 2021 and 8.4% in the past three months. The underlying drivers of consumer inflation are rising at least as fast, with the annual Producer Price Index for 2021 up 10.6% through June and the Import Price Index up 15.8%.<br />With virtually every inflation warning light flashing red for the first time since the early 1980s, why is there so little concern in Washington about what a growing number of Americans fear is a building crisis? Congress is readying another $4 trillion to $5 trillion of spending fuel for the fire, the White House urges lawmakers to do more and do it sooner, and the Federal Reserve advocates, aids and abets. In America, those who work and sweat for a living gather around their kitchen tables trying to make ends meet as their dreams of homeownership or a new truck slip away. Is it possible that Washington and its principal constituencies are now so protected from inflation that to the president, House speaker and Senate majority leader a new wave of inflation is a small price to pay for the progressive dream of an America dominated by government?<br />Even a cursory accounting reveals the great divide between the protected and the unprotected. The seven largest benefit programs—Social Security, Medicare, Supplemental Security Income, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, civil-service retirement and military pensions—all automatically receive adjustments to benefit levels to offset the effects of inflation. This protection covers roughly 127 million people. And 169 million beneficiaries receive automatic inflation protection in programs ranging from Medicaid and ObamaCare tax credits to student loans, and any program whose eligibility is tied to the poverty rate, which itself is adjusted for inflation.<br />For those federal programs not automatically adjusted for inflation, Congress uses a budget process called “current services baseline” that sets the federal budget for every department, agency, program, project and activity at the previous year’s spending level plus an adjustment for inflation. In this wondrous world, more spending is not an increase unless it’s above the inflation rate, and an increase in spending by less than the inflation rate is deemed a cut.<br />In the past 75 years, total federal spending has grown by more than the inflation rate in all but 11 years. Those years mostly occurred after a previous surge in defense spending was reversed, such as after the U.S. exited from Iraq in 2011, or after a targeted spending surge, such as when the 2009 stimulus was spent out.</td>

      <td>Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Sean Patrick Maloney was extraordinarily self-assured in an Aug. 2 NPR podcast. When asked whether Democrats will “lose their majority” next year, the New York congressman responded emphatically, “No, of course not.”<br />Democrats will retain control of the House, he reasons, because “we’re going to rebuild our country” with President Biden’s $3.5 trillion American Jobs Plan. This spending package includes climate initiatives like bigger subsidies for electric-car buyers and huge investments in so-called human infrastructure such as child care, universal pre-K, and community college—all free.<br />“We’re making a bet on substance,” Mr. Maloney said. Democrats are “going to build the future.”<br />He dismissed concerns about GOP influence over redistricting, saying if Republicans try “rigging this game,” then “well, I think that makes me proud to be a Democrat.” He was all confidence and verve, if a little smarmy.<br />It was an act. Politico later revealed that in a closed-door lunch the previous week, Mr. Maloney shared polling with colleagues showing Democrats behind Republicans by 6 points in generic ballot tests in battleground districts. If the midterms were today, he warned, Democrats would lose the majority.</td>

The value for the chickenpox (and other R0s in the slideshow) came from a graphic from The  New York Times ,  which wasn’t completely accurate.</td>

In truth, top Music Row musicians were performing on a variety of jazz and pop records and were playing jazz in after-hours clubs as far back as the 1950s. The string players heard on country records have often been working orchestral musicians as well. A substantial number of Nashville music-makers played R&B in Memphis, Tenn., or Muscle Shoals, Ala., first. And some of the more daring, transgressive 1980s and ’90s cowpunk and alternative country rockers emerged from the scene that revived Nashville’s Lower Broadway.<br />A major figure in that last setting was drummer and composer John McTigue III, a Berklee College of Music graduate who arrived in town just as such rebellious young country artists as the BR549 band, Greg Garing, Kenny Vaughan, Lucinda Williams and R.B. Morris were defining new musical paths at Tootsie’s Orchid Lounge and, a few doors down, Robert’s Western World—a boot store/music venue. It was there that Mr. McTigue cofounded the longstanding, rhythmically unique band Brazilbilly, which fuses old-school honky-tonk country and rockabilly with Latin beats. In the decades since, he has been the regular drummer for Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell and Carlene Carter, and has backed artists from Loretta Lynn, Wanda Jackson and Charlie Louvin to Brazilian stars Luis Carlos Borges and Renato Borghetti.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—A House committee is entitled to some—but not all—of former President Donald Trump’s financial and tax records that it sought from his accounting firm, a federal judge ruled Wednesday.<br />U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., said the House Oversight Committee had a valid basis for some of the documents it was seeking from Mr. Trump’s accounting firm, Mazars USA LLP, though he limited the scope and time frame of the materials lawmakers could obtain.<br />The decision is the latest in a long-running legal battle that began after the committee, investigating ethics issues in the executive branch, issued a subpoena to the firm in 2019 for eight years of financial records related to Mr. Trump, his real-estate company, his foundation and other entities belonging to the president.<br />The Supreme Court last year said the lower courts were too quick to side with House committees seeking records from the president’s accountants and bankers. Judge Mehta’s ruling Wednesday sought to apply the new legal standards announced by the high court.<br />The judge, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, said the Oversight Committee was on solid legal ground in seeking Trump financial records for two purposes: oversight of a federal government lease agreement for the property occupied by the Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington, and investigating whether Mr. Trump and his businesses improperly profited from his time in the White House.</td>

That is even after a fare sale designed to stoke the return of business traffic in the fall.<br />Southwest’s move reverses airline executives’ bullish tone just a few weeks ago, with rising Delta-variant infections prompting the cancellation of festivals and trade events such as the New York Auto Show planned for later this month.<br />Some consumers are reconsidering activities like travel and eating at restaurants as the surge leads certain retailers and municipalities to reimpose mask mandates.<br />The weekly average number of seated diners tracked on restaurant reservation platform OpenTable was down 8% from 2019 levels for the week that ended Aug. 10, a reversal since late June, when dining activity surpassed 2019 levels.

Haibatullah Alizai, took command as the new overall army chief.<br />The Taliban pressed ahead with their offensive on Wednesday, pushing into the southern city of Kandahar and the eastern city of Ghazni, and mopping up the pockets of routed government forces in the country’s north.<br />Mazar-e-Sharif, with a population of half a million, is the only remaining part of northern Afghanistan still under government control, and its fall would allow the Taliban to gather their forces for a march on Kabul. Leading warlords from the so-called Northern Alliance who battled the Taliban before the 2001 U.S. invasion assembled with Mr. Ghani in Mazar-e-Sharif on Wednesday, promising to roll back recent Taliban gains.</td>

Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) and Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) aims to boost competition and consumer protections by placing new restrictions on how the stores operate and what rules they can impose on app developers. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), chair of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, co-sponsored the bill.<br />Apple said in a statement that its app store “is the cornerstone of our work to connect developers and customers in a way that is safe and trustworthy. The result has been an unprecedented engine of economic growth and innovation.”<br />Google declined to comment on the legislation. Google says that its Android system provides choice that others don’t. Device makers and carriers can preload competing app stores alongside Google Play, for example.<br />Called the Open App Markets Act, the measure is the latest reflection of lawmakers’ concerns about the power of major technology companies across a range of markets including search, advertising and social media. It aims to address longstanding concerns among developers such as Epic Games Inc. about in-app payments and other matters.</td>

      <td>As armchairs return to the puffy, broad-beamed styles of the 1970s and ’80s, interior designers debate whether these soothing seats are antithetical to an elegant room</td>
      <td>For the recurring series, That’s Debatable, we take on a contentious issue of the day and present two spirited arguments—one in favor and the other emphatically opposed. Previous installments from the series are here.<br />Los Angeles fashion designer turned furniture maker Sam Klemick admits that before she could appreciate the appeal of the poofy Big Nap chair she created, even she had to live with it a while. The ecru canvas chair for Otherside Objects, inspired by Maison Martin Margiela’s 1999 Duvet coat, might look like a comforter draped over a seat frame, its conical legs almost comically detailed with prominent fabric ties, but Ms. Klemick believes people are prioritizing comfort these days: “We need levity and joy and a soft place to land when we get home.”<br />Chicago interior designer Marshall Erb concurs. “Everyone is looking for their perch,” he said, “a place for your coffee, a corner with a blanket for watching a movie, a place to work from home, take a nap.” Mr. Erb sees a resurgence in silhouettes from the 1970s and ’80s, like the seats by Italian designer Tobias Scarpa that resemble tufted marshmallows. To create a “nice tension,” Mr. Erb juxtaposes such nebulous seats with natural and classic elements. A smushy Togo Ducaroy chair, with its big earthworm-like segments, looks more at home against linear Parisian-style wainscoting and geometric accents, he said. A square, petrified-wood coffee table or a piece of black-and-white abstract art would offset the distinctive shape without vying for attention.<br />When Ms. Klemick posted the Big Nap chair on Instagram, it sold within hours to a friend who used the pillowy seat to soften a living room with a low, boxy tweed couch. The buyer conformed to Ms. Klemick’s advice to let the large chair “steal the show.”<br />Their womb-like form makes them good for dozing, but elegant these unstructured chairs are not. “They can feel oppressive,” said London interior designer Mary Graham of the burly seats’ tendency to dominate a room. Robust chairs in simplistic shapes are best left to tech-startup break rooms and hotel lobbies, she said. “You can have comfort and good design, but I don’t think chunky comes into the equation,” said Mrs. Graham, who prefers a dignified silhouette that evinces craftsmanship. “If I want to jump into a duvet, I am going into my bedroom.”</td>

      <td>MOSCOW—Belarus announced retaliatory action against Washington, including rescinding its consent of the appointment of the U.S. ambassador, in response to the latest U.S. sanctions on the regime of the country’s authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko.<br />“In recent years, our countries have come a long way in bringing diplomatic relations to a more or less acceptable level, so it is a pity that the impudent and openly hostile actions of the American side…destroyed the achievements of their predecessors,” Belarus’s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Anatoly Glaz, said in comments posted Wednesday on the ministry’s website.<br />His remarks came two days after the Biden administration announced measures targeting critical parts of Belarus’s economy, including its defense industry and lucrative potash fertilizer sector. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the steps were in response to the “continued flagrant disregard for human rights and Belarus’s failure to comply with its obligations under international human-rights law.”<br />The U.K. and Canada also announced more financial sanctions on Monday to pressure Mr. Lukashenko to resign. The Belarusian leader launched an often-violent crackdown on protesters seeking his removal following a presidential election last summer that his opponents and Western leaders say was rigged.<br />Mr. Glaz said Belarus’s countermeasures included revoking the appointment of Julie Fisher, who was sworn in as the U.S. ambassador to Minsk last December but hasn’t yet arrived to assume her position. He also suggested that the U.S. Embassy in Minsk reduce its staff to five people by Sept. 1 and suspended negotiations on new projects, programs and grants with the U.S. government.</td>

Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), an influential centrist who has raised objections to previous Democratic bills, expressed alarm over the budget resolution’s price tag Wednesday, shortly after the Senate officially kicked off the process of crafting a package of antipoverty, education, healthcare and climate provisions with a predawn 50-49 party-line vote.<br />“I have serious concerns about the grave consequences facing West Virginians and every American family if Congress decides to spend another $3.5 trillion,” Mr. Manchin said Wednesday. “Given the current state of the economic recovery, it is simply irresponsible to continue spending at levels more suited to respond to a Great Depression or Great Recession—not an economy that is on the verge of overheating.”<br />Mr. Manchin voted to approve the budget framework, but said he hoped Democrats would “seriously consider this reality,” as they begin the work of translating the budget blueprint into detailed legislation.<br />Figures released Wednesday showed inflation remained elevated in July, but there was evidence of cooling amid signs that the recent rise in Covid-19 infections is starting to weigh on the strong economic recovery after last year’s pandemic-driven recession.</td>

      <td>The New York Stock Exchange will require traders to be vaccinated against Covid-19 to access its historic trading floor, stepping up its measures against the coronavirus amid rising cases of the Delta variant.<br />Traders and other personnel who work on the floor will need to be fully vaccinated by Sept. 13, unless they qualify for a medical or religious exemption, NYSE Chief Operating Officer Michael Blaugrund said in a Wednesday email to the exchange’s floor community.<br />Those who are granted medical or religious exemptions will need to be masked and present recent negative Covid-19 tests before accessing the floor, Mr. Blaugrund wrote in the email, a copy of which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />The memo cited “recent shifts in public health conditions as well as updated recommendations from federal, state and local authorities.” NYSE is also expanding its on-site random testing program to include vaccinated personnel, effective immediately, the memo said.<br />The NYSE’s total floor population numbers several hundred people, including traders, exchange employees and technology vendors. During the heyday of in-person stock trading in the early 2000s, thousands crowded onto the floor on weekdays, but the rise of electronic trading since then has decimated staffing levels.</td>

Here are a dozen: We’ll  let him do the talking.<br /><br />S.A. Cosby, “Razorblade Tears” (Flatiron, 319 pages, $26.99)<br />“Mr. Cosby has followed his well-received debut novel, ‘Blacktop Wasteland,’ with a double-barreled action saga that brings to mind the mayhem of early Dashiell Hammett and the bedlam of vintage Sam Peckinpah. Leavening the violence is the salty banter of two bereaved fathers who turn out to be, for better and worse, much more alike than they suspected.” Read the review</td>

      <td>The conclusion of the latest report by the United Nations advisory body on climate—that temperatures are rising, and some effects are irreversible—wasn’t surprising. Those views are largely in line with its last report, in 2013.<br />More interesting and potentially more significant is that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has become more confident in those views.<br />Because climate change is so complex, uncertainty is intrinsic to its study: uncertainty over its underlying drivers, their magnitudes and how they interact; over its consequences, such as on weather patterns; and over the costs and benefits of mitigation. It is why the IPCC, which helps shape its 195 member governments’ mitigation plans, assigns varying levels of confidence to its findings, which are based on reviews of thousands of studies and modeling by numerous independent scientists.<br />The increased confidence the IPCC shows in its findings in its latest report has both encouraging and sobering implications. On the encouraging side the IPCC has dialed back the probability of (without ruling out) more extreme changes in temperature. Such scenarios have often been used to justify much faster and costlier action to ban or limit fossil fuels. On the sobering side, benign outcomes are also less likely, and uncertainty a less viable excuse for inaction.<br />“Climate change is in many ways an issue of ‘tails,’ ” said Zeke Hausfather, director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute, a think tank focused on environmental issues, and a contributing author to the IPCC report. Tails represent rarer, more extreme observations in a set of data.</td>

      <td>The U.S. budget deficit narrowed to $2.5 trillion during the first 10 months of the fiscal year from $2.8 trillion in the same period a year earlier, with the gap between spending and revenue shrinking as the recovery from the pandemic-induced slump boosted tax collection.<br />Outlays for the 10-month period rose 4% to a record $5.9 trillion, the Treasury Department said Wednesday. Spending has been boosted by pandemic-related costs that included tax credits, expanded unemployment compensation, emergency small-business loans and stimulus checks to households, but Treasury officials said such outlays are generally decelerating.<br />Federal revenue during the period rose 18% from the same period the previous year to a record $3.3 trillion, largely due to higher receipts from individual and corporate income taxes.<br />Revenue declined 54% to $262 billion in July from the same month last year. Treasury officials said revenue was unusually high last July because many tax payments were deferred from earlier in the year as a pandemic relief measure. Spending in July decreased 10% to $564 billion.<br />While revenue is rising as consumer and business spending picks up and employers add jobs, supply-chain challenges and a lack of workers for lower-paying jobs are headwinds to economic growth.</td>

      <td>Changes to iOS give advantage to videogame software maker’s advertising platform</td>
      <td>For  Unity Software ,  the ability to manage through changes on Apple’s mobile ecosystem is proving to be rewarding.<br />Unity’s second-quarter results late Tuesday revved up investors, with revenue jumping 48% year over year to $273.6 million. That was an acceleration from the previous two quarters and about 13% ahead of Wall Street’s projections. The company’s revenue forecast for the third quarter was also ahead of estimates, sending the stock up nearly 11% by midday—in line for its best single-day gain since November.<br />Unity has long been best-known for its tools used by videogame developers, such as its self-titled game engine. But its largest business consists of services used by game publishers and other companies to host their content and generate revenue from it—typically through advertising and in-game transactions. This has proven to be a lucrative business given the shift in the game industry to focus on live services that drive recurring revenue as opposed to upfront sales. Unity’s Operate Solutions segment generated nearly $584 million in revenue for the trailing 12-month period ended June—up 56% from the same period last year.<br />But since many of the games served by Unity are played on Apple’s iOS mobile platform, investors have worried about the impact of recent changes made by the iPhone giant. Those changes limit the ability of companies to make use of Apple’s advertising identification tag for users, known as IDFA, unless users opted in. Apple announced the changes in June 2020—three months before Unity’s initial public offering. Unity thus added a warning to its IPO filing but noted the effect of the proposed changes wasn’t yet clear.<br />The recent results gave some needed clarity. Apple finally enacted the changes in April, but business at Unity’s Operate segment that would have felt the impact actually picked up, with revenue there jumping 63% year over year compared with a 40% rise in the March quarter. Unity has amassed its own huge pool of valuable user data—the company says it now captures and analyzes 50 billion in-app events each day—which puts it in a prime position to help customers direct their advertising spending. “Hence, Unity is emerging as a net beneficiary of IDFA for now and appears to be gaining market share,” wrote Stephen Ju of  Credit Suisse .</td>

The Fed has been purchasing large quantities of assets to provide extra stimulus after cutting its short-term interest rate to near zero, and officials in December pledged to continue those purchases until making “substantial” progress toward economic and labor-market health.<br />“With the recovery under way, a transition from extraordinary monetary policy accommodation to more neutral settings must follow,” Ms. George said in a speech to the National Association for Business Economics on Wednesday. “Today’s tight economy…certainly does not call for a tight monetary policy, but it does signal that the time has come to dial back the settings.”<br />Inflation has soared since April amid supply-chain bottlenecks and other obstacles related to reopening the economy. Even if some of those factors reverse, strong demand, a recovering labor market and stable inflation expectations mean the central bank no longer needs to buy assets to provide stimulus, Ms. George said. “I support bringing asset purchases to an end,” she said.<br />Fed officials debated at their meeting last month when and how to reduce those purchases and are set to resume deliberations at their meeting on Sept. 21-22.</td>

It is now hoping for another shot when the bill moves to the House.<br />The provision in the roughly $1 trillion plan, approved by the Senate Tuesday, requires brokers of digital assets to report on gains from trading to the Internal Revenue Service. As crafted, it would raise an estimated $28 billion over a decade to help pay for improved roads, bridges, ports and other infrastructure.<br />Proponents of the Senate’s provision say it would help crack down on tax evasion while also making it easier for crypto investors to meet their tax obligations. Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) was the lead writer of the provision, in consultation with the Biden administration.<br />But the cryptocurrency industry says the provision was written too broadly and might extend to entities that aren’t brokers and don’t hold customer information. That could inadvertently limit innovation, the industry says.<br />“Washington politics prevailed over common sense,” said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association, an industry lobbying group, adding that this week’s “setback isn’t the end.”</td>

      <td>Ryan Bartlow of Ernesto’s in New York City has figured out a foolproof way to keep eggs from overcooking. His recipe for a soft scramble with seared wild mushrooms and shrimp makes a delicious meal in minutes.</td>
      <td>COOKING IN Spain, Ryan Bartlow learned to respect the humble egg. In his fourth Slow Food Fast recipe, a Spanish-style soft scramble makes a sumptuous vehicle for seared wild mushrooms and shrimp. “Who doesn’t love scrambled eggs with mushrooms?” Mr. Bartlow asked. “And why not add shrimp? It’s an earthy, soft, rich umami bomb.”<br />As delicious as the other ingredients are, the eggs hold this dish together—literally—and should be handled with care. Mr. Bartlow avoids overbeating them before cooking: The yolks and whites should not break down entirely. “You want streaks in the bowl,” he said. “It gives texture and a marbled look.” The chef further cautioned against overcooking. He turns off the burner partway through and lets the scramble finish setting in the pan’s residual heat. The result: plump, luscious curds.<br />The pan itself should be small enough so the eggs don’t spread too thin and cook too quickly—about 9 inches works well. Stir as you cook to control the way the eggs set. “All the bites should be roughly the same size,” Mr. Bartlow said. “You essentially want the egg curds to match the bites of mushroom and shrimp.”<br />Lastly and crucially, don’t skimp on the fat. “There’s not a lot here, so be sure to use enough olive oil,” Mr. Bartlow said. Crème fraîche enriches the scramble further. Toast is the only accompaniment you’ll need, but do use the best bread available. These eggs deserve it.<br />To explore and search through all our recipes, check out the new WSJ Recipes page.</td>

      <td>Democrats want to dismantle a century-old tax law that has protected American agriculture.</td>
      <td>As former chairman and taxpayer watchdog serving on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, I’m girding for my next dogfight. President Biden has set his sights on enacting a new death tax on top of the existing estate tax. Yes, it’s as unfair as it sounds. The Democrats want to reach into the grave and tax Americans’ lifelong savings to pay for cradle-to-grave entitlements.<br />Mr. Biden’s plan would subject the on-paper-only gain of property and assets to new federal taxes when Americans transfer ownership to the next generation. This progressive dream come true is a nightmare for economic freedom in America.<br />On the campaign trail, Mr. Biden vowed that none of his tax increases would hit the middle class. He claims eliminating “step-up in basis”—the starting point for assessing capital-gains taxes—wouldn’t harm America’s family farms and businesses.<br />When you’ve served in Congress as long as I have—I arrived in the House in 1975 and the Senate in 1981—it’s not surprising to see ghosts rise from the legislative cemetery. Consider the Tax Revenue Act of 1976. Big spenders figured they found a cash cow to milk by capturing a greater share of inherited assets, in addition to the estate tax. The law sought to impose carryover basis—applying capital gains taxes on the original purchase price of assets on death to the beneficiaries of property, farmland, assets and securities.<br />In practice, these changes would have chewed up family farms and fractured the economic backbone of rural America. Looking back, I see the 94th Congress poked a hornet’s nest in a classic case of Potomac fever—a fixation to increase revenue and redistribute income. It stung in farm country. Blessedly, its implementation was deferred not long after President Ford’s signature.</td>

      <td>Cooler consumer price inflation in July isn’t evidence that it will subside to pre-pandemic levels soon</td>
      <td>Inflation is cooling down, but that doesn’t mean it is about to go cold.<br />The Labor Department on Wednesday reported that its measure of consumer prices rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in July from a month earlier—a smaller gain than June’s 0.9% increase—putting it 5.4% above its year-earlier level. Much of that gain was driven by price increases in food and fuel. Core prices, which exclude food and energy prices in an effort to better capture inflation’s trend, rose 0.3% in July from a month earlier after rising 0.9% in June.<br />A big part of why the core reading moderated last month was that used-car prices, which had been a significant driver of inflation over the past several months, have finally begun to ease. By the Labor Department’s measure, they rose just 0.2% in July from a month earlier after surging 10.7% in June.<br />Further cooling may be in the offing: A used-car price index from auction company Manheim, which the Labor Department data tend to lag behind, slipped 2.6% in July from June.<br />Used-car prices are just one of the many elements of inflation that seem likely to cool off as shortages and supply-chain bottlenecks get resolved. It could be a drawn-out process, though. The semiconductor shortage that has hampered new-car manufacturing hasn’t gone away, and though auto companies’ production schedules suggest they will be making more cars in the months ahead, inventory levels don’t look likely to fully recover until some time next year.</td>

      <td>SEOUL— Samsung Electronics Co.  is betting the world is finally ready for its foldable phones.<br />Consumers had initially balked at a price tag that hovered around $2,000. Durability remained a concern. Closed stores during the pandemic meant few buyers could see and touch a foldable phone that looks dramatically different from everything else.<br />That has brought an underwhelming debut to what had been one of the smartphone industry’s most-hyped products of late. The device has a tablet-size screen that folds in half like a book, becoming small enough to carry in a hand, pocket or purse. When closed, a second display on the outside can field most tasks.<br />Roh Tae-moon, president of Samsung’s mobile-communications business, said he has heard all the complaints. He is hopeful the company’s two new foldable devices, which were unveiled Wednesday, become more than fringe products in the smartphone market.<br />“We’ve seen that users who have tried foldable phones like the experience and say they want to use them again,” Mr. Roh said. “But it’s hard to discover the value of foldables if they haven’t had a chance to experience them.”</td>

      <td>We tested high-tech new shade-givers that improve on the seaside staple—including ones that promise not to blow away during even the strongest gusts</td>
      <td>SAND-PLANTED PARASOLS have done a perfectly adequate job providing shade since their inception in Ancient Egypt, where royalty relied on them to keep cool under the blistering Middle Eastern sun. (In fact, sun umbrellas predate even their rainy-day cousins.) But anyone who has ever clung onto one during a particularly enthusiastic sea breeze knows how quickly the beachside staple can turn into an airborne weapon, flying off to impale an unsuspecting sunbather. Plus, they are cumbersome to carry and don’t provide much cooling beyond deflecting rays.<br />After centuries of sameness, designers of tech-y new models are betting that you’re ready for a change. We put a few new models to the test—from ultralight tents to suspended, kite-like sails—trying them both in wind and dead calm as well as on an empty and ultra-crowded beach. Here, our picks.<br />There is nothing subtle about this highflying shade, which comes equipped with its own stack of business cards for curious passersby. (Really.) Designed to work with the wind rather than against it, the parachute fabric rippled from a single arched pole to create a shade that blocks 97% of harmful rays—even in what felt like dead calm. It fared even better on a windy day, when a standard umbrella would have blown away. We easily anchored the pole in the sand and unfurled the canopy in a few minutes. But while the shade is compact and ultra light when folded, its 15-by-10-foot footprint when open made it tricky to set up in the middle of a crowded New York beach, earning us a few heckles when we tried. Its main downside is noise. Like a sail flapping on a boat, this shade was louder than the ocean. $250, shibumishade.com<br />Stylish and colorful, with a variety of fabric options, this tent left us feeling regal when we spent the day perched under it—and inevitably disappointed when nobody walked by to deliver bubbly on a silver tray. Setting it up, however, required a bit of stamina and the help of a taller friend to drape the fabric over the transverse pole. Setting up isn’t exactly simple (The first step on the directions is to “measure” for the distance between the stakes, which was intimidating). Erecting the device didn’t ultimately take more than 10 minutes, but it did require some trial and error to get placement of the stakes and strings right, and even then, felt wobbly on a windy day that was fine for umbrellas. And including the anchoring ropes, this small tent takes up a lot of real estate on the sand. $299, businessandpleasureco.com<br />With three sides to shield babies, pets and food from sand and sun, this ultralight, low-ceilinged pop-up tent promises to be a dream for oceanfront picnics. Setup is easy as opening the zipper of the bag. And since it’s only 6 pounds, we were able to carry it down the beach steps with ease. But on a windy day, the stakes pulled out of the sand within seconds, leading to a chase down the beach to catch it. Even on a less-breezy day, without something or someone inside to anchor it, the tent nearly blew away. Directions that read “folds in on itself with a few turns of the wrist,” were not exactly accurate. Dismount was nothing short of exhausting. Of the seven people who attempted to put it away, only one succeeded. The rest experienced 45 minutes of hearty laughter. $65, food52.com</td>

      <td>We dropped into dozens of beach chairs to find the best so that you don’t have to. Here, our six favorites—based on price, style, ability to withstand sand and all-day sit-ability</td>
      <td>For the better part of a decade, I have been on a quest to find the perfect beach chair. Wooed by slick Instagram ads promising a better, more life-altering seat, I buy a newer, fancier model annually. Then right about this time of summer, I realize its shortcomings.<br />My efforts aren’t lost on my regular beach-sitting crew. As we gather each July at Wiborg Beach in East Hampton, N.Y., they watch with amusement as I unveil my latest. Sometimes it is tricked out and, often, complicated to use. This year, I blew the bank and went big, arriving on the sand with a $198 Sunflow. As I muddled through the five-step process of opening it, I assured my friends (as I have with other chairs in the past) that it was, in fact, “the Cadillac of beach chairs.” Every year, on cue, my friend Martha somewhat smugly says that her small, no-name chair is old (14 this year), that it is “perfect” and that she OxiCleans it at the end of each season to keep it looking new. It doesn’t do much: It opens. And it closes. These two factors should not be taken for granted. I once had to stuff a new seat into the back of my car fully ajar after I couldn’t get it to fold down. (Another not only tipped over while I sat in it but was so difficult to open I felt certain hundreds of comfortably seated sunbathers were mocking me as I tried to set it up.)<br />To save you the shame, struggle and expense of buying the wrong beach chair yourself, I decided to conduct a slightly more scientific review of my fleet, as well as some new additions. I built my test list off the suggestions I gathered by asking fellow beachgoers about their own chairs. Most people, I learned, have strong opinions. I made sure to hit various price points and include a range of standout features, from ultra-strong frames to customizable cushions. I also weeded out a few camping and lawn chairs not made primarily for sand. Then I enlisted the help of friends and strangers to test the comfort, style and ease of use each offered. Here, my favorite six.<br />The petite, no-nonsense Rio Wave opens to just one position and boasts not so much as a cupholder. But what this seat lacks in features it makes up for in value and consistency. At under $40, it’s less than half the price of the next-most-expensive model we recommend, and it employs a ripstop fabric and steel frame to withstand sand and surf.<br />User Friendliness: Beyond price, this chair’s best attribute is its weight: 5 pounds. You can carry two on one arm and your cooler in the other. It’s so low and close to the sand, however, that getting out of it requires agility.</td>

But credit reports often don’t include residential-rent payments because most landlords don’t report the data to credit-reporting firms. Renters’ credit scores, which are based on information in their credit reports, as a result also don’t reflect that data.<br />The issue has been problematic for consumers with limited borrowing histories, who have difficulty getting approved for affordable credit.<br />“In some markets, it’s just as expensive to rent as it is to own,” said Hugh Frater, Fannie Mae’s chief executive. For many renters, “they have the history of making payments, which in my opinion should be equally and fairly considered in their ability to pay a mortgage.”</td>

Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flier website and travel-concierge service, says a few clients canceled their coming trips to international destinations last week.<br />Some seem to fear getting sick or testing positive and not being able to return home for an extended period from their international destination, he says.  United Airlines ,  for example, says that passengers won’t be able to travel on the airline for at least 10 days after the date they tested positive, which it says is in accordance with CDC guidance.</td>

      <td>10b5-1 plans allow executives to create schedules for buying and selling shares in the future, but they can be modified without disclosure</td>
      <td>Securities regulators are rethinking rules on popular plans that let corporate executives sell stock without violating insider-trading provisions.<br />The plans—known as 10b5-1 plans—allow executives to create schedules for buying and selling shares in the future. In theory, a predetermined sale, even if it comes at a fortuitous time, wouldn’t be based on inside information.<br />But years of research has shown that the reality is more complicated: Executives might establish a plan to sell shares that very day. Executives could set up a raft of plans to sell on different days, then cancel most of them. They can modify plans without disclosing what they are doing.<br />Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler has expressed skepticism about the plans and in June asked the commission’s staff to recommend changes that would curb abuses. Lawmakers called for changes last year after pharmaceutical executives developing Covid-19 vaccines sold $500 million worth of shares; many of the sales came under 10b5-1 plans that were modified after vaccine trials began. The companies say the trades followed rules for 10b5-1 plans, and no one has been accused of wrongdoing.<br />The plans are wildly popular: They accounted for 61% of all insider trades during 2020, up from 30% in 2004, according to data from InsiderScore, a research service tracking executive-trading data.</td>

This makes them the second-biggest party after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives.<br />Their agenda goes beyond measures to fight climate change and would break long-established German policy taboos surrounding public debt and fiscal integration in Europe while aligning foreign policy closer with that of the U.S.<br />The party is calling for 50 billion euros a year, equivalent to $58.7 billion, in green investments, largely funded by public borrowing. That would almost certainly clash with the strict balanced-budget rules enshrined in Germany’s constitution.</td>

The so-called core price index, which excludes the often volatile categories of food and energy, likely increased 4.4% from a year before, they estimate.<br />The CPI measures what consumers pay for goods and services, including groceries, clothes, restaurant meals, recreation and vehicles. Economists also estimate it rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in July from June, a cooler pace than its 0.9% increase in June from May.<br />Aneta Markowska, chief financial economist at Jefferies LLC, expects a monthly increase of 0.6%. “That would be a little less than we’ve seen but certainly one of the highest since the early 1990s. Definitely no relief there,” she said. She also expects the report to show significant price increases for a broader variety of goods and services than in recent months.<br />Inflation has heated up this year for several reasons. U.S. gross domestic product rose at a rapid 6.5% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the second quarter, powered by consumer spending that climbed at an 11.8% pace as more people received vaccinations, businesses reopened and trillions of dollars in federal aid flowed through the economy.</td>

The government also publishes significant amounts of data that allow the course of the pandemic to be closely tracked.<br />Between 90% and 94% of British adults have some degree of immunity to coronavirus from full or partial vaccination, or prior infection, the U.K. statistics office estimates, based on statistical analysis of blood samples. That is almost certainly playing a big role in keeping a lid on cases and ensuring subdued hospital admissions and deaths, say scientists, though school holidays, warm weather and other factors are also pushing against transmission.<br />A key test will come in the fall, doctors and scientists say, when schools return and colder temperatures drive people indoors, where the virus can spread more easily.

Mr. McConnell was one of 19 Senate Republicans who voted yes.<br />Without Mr. Biden’s support, centrist Democrats, led by Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, wouldn’t have been able to get the bill across the finish line, Mr. McConnell said.</td>

Both companies are listed in Hong Kong and their shares also jumped on Wednesday.<br />The developer didn’t say how much of each business it plans to sell and when the talks with what it called “independent third-party investors” would be concluded.

You’re invited to play along with us here.<br />After a disastrous 2020, travel has begun recovering in 2021, offering some hope for beleaguered airline investors. Chinese airlines weathered the initial storm relatively well, as domestic tourism roared back and helped cushion the hit to international travel. But with China now fighting to contain the highly contagious Delta variant of Covid-19, domestic tourism is again struggling, and the day the nation reopens its international borders is looking ever farther off.<br />One way to play a “locked away for longer” theme for China would be to sell airline stocks, particularly those like Air China with big exposure to international travel.<br />Although the stock has struggled this year, it still looks richly priced compared with U.S. peers, trading at 16 times expected 2022 earnings, according to Wind, against nine times for  Delta Air Lines  and 12 times for  United Airlines Holdings ,  according to FactSet. The stock also has to contend with Air China’s 30% stake in Hong Kong flag carrier  Cathay  Pacific, which has been punished by the city’s quarantine rules, among the toughest in the world. Cathay trades at 42 times expected 2022 earnings, reflecting the Hong Kong aviation industry’s dependence on international travel.<br />In late 2020 and early 2021, there were good reasons to think Chinese airlines were a better bet. Middle-class Chinese, with nowhere else to go, helped drive a sharp rebound in domestic passenger traffic as the threat from the coronavirus receded. Fast progress on China’s vaccination campaign beginning in the late spring also raised hopes that border controls might be loosened. At the time, assuming that Air China’s operating revenue would rebound to 98% of 2019 levels in 2022, the current consensus forecast according to data from Wind, didn’t seem unreasonable.</td>

      <td>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned under pressure Tuesday while protesting his innocence of sexual harassment, and no doubt state legislators are relieved. That’s a shame. With Mr. Cuomo insisting the allegations are “unfair,” democratic accountability would have been better served if he had been able to defend himself in an impeachment.<br />The bottom fell out of Mr Cuomo’s political support last week after Attorney General Letitia Jamesreleased a report laying out allegations against the Governor by 11 women. If true, the sexually charged remarks and touching and groping would be cause for firing an executive at any private firm. Yet Mr. Cuomo said Tuesday that “I truly believe it is politically motivated,” even as he resigned.<br />The Governor made many enemies in 11 years in Albany, and he is especially resented by his party’s left wing. The report (at his request) was commissioned by one of the left’s champions, Ms. James, who may aspire to the Governorship. A co-author, Joon Kim, previously had Mr. Cuomo’s office in his crosshairs as a prosecutor. It’s no coincidence the charges surfaced only after Mr. Cuomo was no longer feted by an adoring media as a heroic anti-Trump foil amid the 2020 election.<br />Mr. Cuomo’s lawyer, Rita Glavin, argued in the days before his resignation that the investigators bent their investigation to fit a pre-determined conclusion. Citing email timestamps, she raised legitimate questions about how carefully Ms. James’s team reviewed one serious allegation—that Mr. Cuomo groped an executive assistant in the Governor’s mansion in November 2020.<br />Yet even Mr. Cuomo didn’t allege the charges came out of thin air. “In my mind, I’ve never crossed the line with anyone,” he said. “But I didn’t realize the extent to which the line has been redrawn.”</td>

      <td>The worker shortage grows more extreme, which was predicted.</td>
      <td>Vindication is overrated, especially when warnings about bad economic policy turn out to be true. But there are few better examples of a warning vindicated sooner and more completely than the one in March about the danger to employment from the federal benefits for not working in the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion Covid spending bill.<br />The Labor Department reported Monday that the economy had 10.1 million job openings in June. That’s up from 9.5 million in May, which was up from 9.2 million in April. This comes amid a booming recovery as the pandemic lockdowns ease and there were 8.7 million unemployed workers in July. Those jobless don’t include people who aren’t even looking for work, which are in the millions as the labor participation rate is only 61.7, which is 1.6 points lower than in February 2020.<br />Meantime, on Tuesday the National Federation of Independent Business reported a dip in its small business optimism index. Small employers are worried about getting adequate supplies, rising prices for those supplies, and a shortage of workers. Forty-nine percent of the owners reported job openings they couldn’t fill in July, up three percentage points from June and a record high. The 48-year historical average is 22%.<br />The Occam’s razor explanation is that millions of Americans are making more money by not working than putting in an eight hour day. The $300 enhanced jobless benefit doesn’t expire until September, though 26 states have stopped taking it. Those states by and large have lower jobless rates. There’s also the expanded healthcare subsidies, child care payments, per child tax credits, food stamps, and more.<br />All of this adds up to a significant guaranteed annual income, with no requirement to work for a living. Democrats said at the start of the pandemic that this would be temporary, but now they want to make it permanent in their $3.5 trillion budget. No one should be surprised that when you pay people this much not to work, millions decide not to work.</td>

      <td>Pelosi fears she lacks the votes in the House, so she’s jamming the GOP.</td>
      <td>Democrats run the White House and all of Capitol Hill, and they keep telling everyone they can pass a $3.5 trillion spending bill with 50 Senate votes and nary a Republican. Then why are they ducking responsibility for raising the U.S. debt limit that would let them finance their unprecedented spending?<br />In 2019 Congress passed a two-year suspension of the debt limit, but it expired July 31. The Treasury Department is already employing “emergency measures” to keep paying government bills without issuing new debt beyond today’s $28 trillion.<br />The obvious step is for Democrats to include a debt-limit increase as part of the budget resolution they plan to pass in the Senate this week, following Tuesday’s passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. They can pass the budget with 50 Democrats, plus Vice President Kamala Harris, and Republicans can’t stop them.<br />Yet the $3.5 trillion resolution includes everything except the debt-limit increase. Democrats plan instead to pair the debt limit with a short-term spending bill after Labor Day designed to keep the government open after Sept. 30. This means that Minority Leader Mitch McConnell will have to deliver at least 10 GOP votes to overcome a Senate filibuster. The White House on Monday rolled out Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to provide cover for this gambit, lecturing that raising the debt ceiling is the “shared responsibility” of both parties.<br />It is when there’s divided government, but not when one party runs the whole show. The real game here is that Democratic leaders fear they lack the House votes to pass their $3.5 trillion budget and a debt-ceiling increase.</td>

      <td>Negotiators wrote a sloppy provision that could slow innovation.</td>
      <td>The Senate passed its infrastructure bill on Tuesday but not before a cryptocurrency crackup that is all too typical of today’s Washington. This is what happens when insiders write bills that they release at the last minute on issues they don’t understand.<br />The White House wants more tax reporting of cryptocurrency transactions, not without reason. The IRS treats virtual currencies as property, meaning that people who sell their coins owe tax on their gains. But many don’t report crypto income on their tax returns. Some don’t know they have to, but some are intentionally dodging taxes.<br />Enter the Senate infrastructure negotiators, who tucked in a provision requiring crypto “brokers,” or “any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person,” to report trades to the IRS. They say the rule would raise $28 billion in revenue to pay for their bill.<br />The expansive provision was a five-alarm fire among crypto enthusiasts. Requiring reporting from incorporated crypto exchanges isn’t controversial. But users worried the definition of “broker” was so broad that it could sweep in ordinary bitcoin miners, digital coin “validators” and software and hardware developers of digital wallets where people store private keys to access digital coins.<br />It would also ostensibly apply to decentralized peer-to-peer networks in which users trade currencies without a financial intermediary. This innovation has the potential to reduce trading friction, though it can also be used for tax evasion. Yet unlike brokers and exchanges, none of these crypto developers have commercial relationships with buyers and sellers.</td>

The best responses will be published that night.<br /><br />Academia Is a Numbers Game<br />It’s getting harder to justify getting a Ph.D. in history. Take the job market, or lack thereof. The National Science Foundation’s survey of earned doctorates found that in 2019 U.S. institutions granted 912 history Ph.D.s. Yet, according to a report that same year by the American Historical Association, there were only 515 unique job postings for tenure-track faculty vacancies. Chances are a professorship in your field won’t await you at the end of the road. The aspiring academics among us should be realistic about that and consider alternative careers in secondary education, journalism and public policy, among others.<br />The doctorate is also expensive. Some schools offer funding packages that defray all or some of the cost, but this is not guaranteed. Students who pay their own way will often emerge with considerable debt. Even those lucky enough to emerge with a tenure-track position probably won’t be raking in the dough. The average assistant professor made a little more than $82,000 in 2019-20 according to the American Association of University Professors, and I’d wager that figure is lower still for history professors. Then there’s the opportunity cost. Why fritter away five-plus years chasing a credential only to end up with a job you could have gotten without it? You’ve lost time that could have been better spent elsewhere.</td>

      <td>He offered ‘startup’ tax breaks to General Electric, which started in 1892 and chose Boston anyway.</td>
      <td>Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s resignation was memorable, but we shouldn’t forget his policy legacy. New York state was slowly emerging from the Great Recession when he was elected governor in 2010. Amid massive job losses and collapsing revenues, he took office in 2011 with a focus on rebuilding public finances and promoting economic growth.<br />During his first term, he positioned himself as a Clintonesque centrist with a pro-business tilt. He’s still often called a moderate, but the label has been inaccurate for years.<br />By the start of his second term, in 2015, Mr. Cuomo was promoting “economic justice” in the form of a $15 minimum wage, initially restricted to New York City. In his third term, starting in 2019, he sprinted to the left and loudly proclaimed his progressive credentials as a new generation of left-leaning Democrats assumed control of the formerly split Legislature.<br />Things were different a decade ago. “New York has no future as the tax capital of the nation,” he declared in his 2011 State of the State address. “Our young people will not stay. Our business will not come. This has to change.”<br />Within six months of taking office, Mr. Cuomo closed a $10 billion budget gap, drew a hard line in contract talks with state employee unions, and persuaded lawmakers to approve a strict 2% cap on annual growth in property taxes. The cap doesn’t apply to New York City, but it’s still among the most significant limited-government reforms ever enacted in the Empire State.</td>

      <td>Despite constant warnings of catastrophe, things aren’t anywhere near as dire as the media say.</td>
      <td>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has issued its latest report assessing the state of the climate and projecting its future. As usual, the media and politicians are exaggerating and distorting the evidence in the report. They lament an allegedly broken climate and proclaim, yet again, that we are facing the “last, best chance” to save the planet from a hellish future. In fact, things aren’t—and won’t be—anywhere near as dire.<br />The new report, titled AR6, is almost 4,000 pages, written by several hundred government-nominated scientists over the past four years. It should command our attention, especially because this report will be a crucial element of the coming United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow. Leaders from 196 countries will come together there in November, likely to adopt more-aggressive nonbinding pledges to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.<br />Previous climate-assessment reports have misrepresented scientific research in the “conclusions” presented to policy makers and the media. The summary of the most recent U.S. government climate report, for instance, said heat waves across the U.S. have become more frequent since 1960, but neglected to mention that the body of the report shows they are no more common today than they were in 1900. Knowledgeable independent scientists need to scrutinize the latest U.N. report because of the major societal and economic disruptions that would take place on the way to a “net zero” world, including the elimination of fossil-fueled electricity, transportation and heat, as well as complete transformation of agricultural methods.<br />It is already easy to see things in this report that you almost certainly won’t learn from the general media coverage. Most important, the model muddle continues. We are repeatedly told “the models say.” But the complicated computer models used to project future temperature, rainfall and so on remain deficient. Some models are far more sensitive to greenhouse gases than others. Many also disagree on the baseline temperature for the Earth’s surface.<br />The latest models also don’t reproduce the global climate of the past. The models fail to explain why rapid global warming occurred from 1910 to 1940, when human influences on the climate were less significant. The report also presents an extensive “atlas” of future regional climates based on the models. Sounds authoritative. But two experts, Tim Palmer and Bjorn Stevens, write in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that the lack of detail in current modeling approaches makes them “not fit” to describe regional climate. The atlas is mainly meant to scare people.</td>

      <td>China punishes Ericsson for Sweden’s exclusion of Huawei. The West can strike back if it unites.</td>
      <td>Beijing vowed to punish the  Swedish telecom  giant  Ericsson  if the Swedes didn’t relent and allow the country’s 5G networks to include Huawei technology. Sweden didn’t budge, and now China has reduced Ericsson’s access to the world’s largest telecom market. No Western company will be safe from such punishment unless Western governments and top companies unite to foil China’s strategy of extortion.<br />Virtually the moment Sweden’s Post and Telecom Authority decided in 2020 not to include Huawei and the smaller Chinese firm ZTE in its 5G network, Chinese officials threatened retaliation. Sweden must reverse its ban or Ericsson would suffer consequences in China, Beijing’s ambassador announced, and the threats continued.<br />The Chinese government’s decision will be painful for Ericsson. The company’s latest quarterly report in July painted a curious picture: 8% growth world-wide—but falling sales in China. The Chinese market has accounted for about 10% of Ericsson’s revenue over the past few years. Around the same time, China Mobile, the country’s largest mobile network operator, announced its latest 5G contracts. Huawei won 60%, ZTE 30%. Ericsson won a mere 2%, down from 11% in the previous round of contracts last year, according to press reports.<br />Compare this with what’s happened to Finland’s  Nokia .  The Finnish Parliament in 2020 passed a law that allowed some firms to be excluded from 5G networks for national-security reasons, but Finnish lawmakers didn’t single out Huawei or ZTE, unlike Sweden’s regulation. The Global Times, an outlet run by the Chinese Communist Party, predicted good things for Nokia, which the newspaper said would have “more room for negotiating” entry into China’s 5G market. Nokia, whose technology had been considered somewhat less desirable, walked away from the 2020 contract round empty-handed. But this summer it suddenly came away with a piece of the action—a 10% stake.<br />The lesson is obvious: Stand up to China and your companies will be punished. Keep your head down and your companies will be fine. Denying business to Western firms isn’t a violation of law. China Mobile’s controlling shareholder is a state-owned company, but the entity is notionally private and can do business with whomever it wishes.</td>

Our library of clips is used in college psychology courses to confirm principles taught in class.<br />Thanks to YouTube, we see how time is becoming blurred for nostalgic viewers. In surprising numbers they cite what they believe to be better behavior and happier emotions in years gone by.

      <td>A fast-moving and suspenseful account of a band of Iraqi intelligence operatives who countered al Qaeda and ISIS.</td>
      <td>In her book “The Spymaster of Baghdad: A True Story of Bravery, Family, and Patriotism in the Battle Against ISIS,” Margaret Coker describes Abu Ali al-Basri as a man out of a spy novel. “He wore a smartly tailored gray suit and button-down shirt without a necktie,” Ms. Coker writes. “His dark brown eyes were alert, but he displayed little emotion as he spoke quietly yet confidently about Iraq’s security situation.” Returning to Iraq in 2017 as the Baghdad bureau chief for the New York Times (after previously reporting there for The Wall Street Journal), Ms. Coker had found the man responsible for a dramatic decline in terrorist attacks in Iraq’s capital. ISIS was on its heels, and Abu Ali al-Basri was ready to tell Ms. Coker why: Iraqi intelligence had infiltrated the terrorist network with a man of its own.<br />Ms. Coker’s fast-moving and suspenseful book tells the story of al-Basri’s Falcons Intelligence Unit, set up by former Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki as a parallel unit to the state’s official intelligence services. The author focuses on two brothers, Harith and Munaf al-Sudani, whose heroic exploits are inspiring to read. Harith al-Sudani, who infiltrated ISIS, was ultimately discovered and killed by the terrorist organization. Munaf, also a member of the Falcons, was in the unenviable position of guiding his brother through his mission while keeping in check his personal attachment to the key member of that mission.<br />The brothers’ story was first related by Ms. Coker in the New York Times in 2018, and has also been told in Arabic media, but the details of their daring achievements should be new to most English-speaking readers. “The Spymaster of Baghdad” is entertaining, indeed almost thrilling at times, with many interesting discoveries for the general and specialist reader alike, but the book falls short of explaining the story within the larger context of Iraqi politics.<br />Ms. Coker weaves a tale of Iraqi patriotism motivating a dedicated band of intelligence operatives working effectively against al Qaeda, then ISIS, as they help to enact democracy in their country. There is a grain of truth to this narrative, but the account here leaves out some context about the Iraqi security services since 2003. Al-Maliki, the group’s godfather, was a Shiite and perhaps the most intensely sectarian head of the Iraqi government since Saddam Hussein. The unit successfully targeted Sunni extremists but left Iranian-backed Shiite militias unchecked as they undermined the state. The group’s successes against al Qaeda and ISIS may be commendable but they were not a solution to the deterioration of the Iraqi state or increasing sectarianism. In fact, the unit was a product of both, and emblematic of the inability since 2003 to create institutions in Iraq that function separate from political and sectarian considerations.<br />Some of the details Ms. Coker uses to flesh out her narrative reflect a Western (and somewhat melodramatic) view of Iraqi realities. For instance, she describes an Iraqi intelligence officer’s love for “reading the legends about his nation’s glorious past as the cradle of civilizations. Ancient Arabs loved a thrilling spy tale, such as the legend of Gilgamesh, in which the heroic king kills his enemies thanks to ingenuity and espionage.” Ancient Arabs, however, almost certainly did not know the Epic of Gilgamesh. Though its origins can be traced to the third millennia B.C., the epic was lost to memory and had disappeared by the time the Arabs arrived in Iraq; it was rediscovered by British scholar George Smith in the 1870s. The work took almost a century to be translated into Arabic for consumption by the Iraqi public. This type of trope is hardly consequential, but nonetheless removed from reality.</td>

France already made the pass mandatory last month for a host of other activities such as entrance to museums, pools, gyms and large sports events.<br />“Some customers say they got the vaccine but didn’t come with the health pass, and we have to say sorry, we cannot accept you,” said Mr. Zerbos, who works as a host at Fouquet’s in Paris. “We can get in serious trouble if we accept someone without the health pass.”<br />French establishments that don’t check the health passes risk a €1,500 fine, the equivalent of about $1,763, which can rise to €9,000 and a year in prison following the third violation within a month.<br />Italy also made the digital health pass mandatory for a range of activities last Friday, although the unvaccinated can still dine at restaurants if they sit outdoors.</td>

      <td>Democrats will face difficult choices, as they work to transform the budget framework into detailed antipoverty and climate legislation</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Senate prepared to pass early Wednesday a $3.5 trillion budget blueprint, the first step in an arduous process designed to allow Democrats to push through a sweeping package of education, healthcare, climate and other provisions without GOP support.<br />The vote, expected to come less than a day after the Senate passed a roughly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package, would notch an initial victory for President Biden and congressional Democrats. They are seeking to pass as much of their legislative agenda as possible this year, before next year’s midterm elections overtake Capitol Hill.<br />But Democrats, who have slim margins in both chambers, will face difficult choices and negotiations, as they work to transform the budget framework into detailed legislation.<br />“Putting all the pieces together will be a challenge, but we’ve got a good place to start in terms of discussions that have already taken place,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D., Md.) Lawmakers are expected to begin those negotiations over Zoom and phone calls during the August recess. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) had set a Sept. 15 target date for committees to submit their pieces of the legislation.<br />For much of the day Tuesday, the Senate slogged through a raft of largely symbolic amendment votes known as vote-a-rama that precede the final vote on the budget resolution. The exercise gives lawmakers a chance to offer amendments often designed to force lawmakers from the other party to take tough votes or demonstrate their support for an issue.</td>

That gauge hit 3.5% in June, its highest level in three decades amid supply-chain bottlenecks associated with reopening the economy.</td>

      <td>Agency says new package fees, running from Oct. 3 to Dec. 26, are needed to offset rising cost of deliveries</td>
      <td>The U.S. Postal Service plans to charge more for packages shipped during the holidays, including those sent by individuals, to offset the rising cost of deliveries at the busiest time of the year.<br />The agency on Tuesday proposed adding surcharges on most packages shipped domestically between Oct. 3 and Dec. 26, saying the fees would apply to both commercial and retail customers. That means it won’t just be  Amazon.com Inc.,   Target Corp.  and other big holiday shippers paying higher-than-normal rates; it will also cost more to ship a box of cookies to grandma.<br />The agency said the added fees, ranging from 25 cents for smaller packages to $5 for heavier items traveling longer distances, are in line with broader industry practices to charge more during the holiday season.<br />“These temporary rates will keep the Postal Service competitive while providing the agency with the revenue to cover extra costs in anticipation of peak-season volume surges similar to levels experienced in 2020,” the agency said in announcing the proposal.<br />Retailers face a range of challenges heading into the holidays, including logjams at seaports, supply-chain disruptions and higher prices for materials and labor that are making it more difficult and expensive to stock their shelves. Adding to the uncertainty is the recent jump in Covid-19 cases fueled by the spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant.</td>

      <td>The Sante Fe Opera’s scaled-down summer season includes one world premiere and three classics, performed and produced to varying degrees of success.</td>
      <td>Santa Fe, N.M.<br />With its open-air theater, Santa Fe Opera had a big advantage in the return to in-person performance this summer. Still, evolving pandemic restrictions and related international travel issues meant this season featured four operas instead of the usual five; last-minute cast changes; production adaptations, including offstage choruses for two shows; reduced audience capacity; and masks required on the theater grounds. Under the circumstances, it was commendable that the company produced a relatively normal-looking opera festival.<br />Composer John Corigliano and librettist Mark Adamo labored for a decade over “The Lord of Cries,” this season’s world premiere, and it showed—though not in a good way. Mr. Adamo’s mash-up makes Bram Stoker’s Count Dracula a 19th-century manifestation of Dionysus in Euripides’ “The Bacchae”; he is on a mission to force the repressed Victorians to acknowledge and embrace their deepest, most forbidden desires—“the beast within.” Plenty of juicy potential, one would think. But with its didactic, convoluted libretto, full of annoying rhymes and repetitions; its stock characters; and its music that never rises above pastiche, the opera was overworked and inert.<br />The only sparks in the evening came from countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo (Dionysus/Dracula), who commanded attention at every appearance with his insinuating, chromatic vocal line and some spectacular costumes by Chrisi Karvonides-Dushenko. But there wasn’t enough of him. Dionysus/Dracula has been wreaking havoc in London with the aid of three witchy attendants (Leah Brzyski, Rachel Blaustein, Megan Moore). He claims ownership of the ruined Carfax Abbey, but John Seward (Jarrett Ott), the moral and upright head of the Carfax Asylum, resists him. Jonathan Harker (David Portillo) has already been driven mad; Harker’s wife, Lucy (Kathryn Henry), and Seward harbor suppressed passion for each other. Lucy and Seward each have long, explanatory arias about why duty trumps desire, but the opera doesn’t make us feel their urges or their connection. And when Seward finally surrenders to his inner beast—tricked into thinking he is killing the Count, he murders Lucy—it seems, to the modern viewer, like a high price to pay for loving someone else’s spouse.<br />Dionysus’ attendants had an arresting musical signature—a dissonant trio with one very high voice and one very low. Other characters were generic. As Seward, Mr. Ott’s attractive lyric baritone was forced into less congenial stentorian territory; as Lucy, Ms. Henry popped out some disconnected high notes and sang a lullaby to her demented husband (a nod to “The Rake’s Progress,” perhaps). Mr. Corigliano relied on instrumental flourishes for effect: In Harker’s mad scene, for example, the orchestra mirrored his scattered mind with a skittering piccolo, followed by Wagnerian brass, and a syrupy violin solo. Numerous moments invoked other pieces—the opening chorus of frightened Londoners recalled “Sweeney Todd.” Showy dramaturgical devices fell flat: The spoken role of a newspaper correspondent felt like an expository shortcut, and a scene that layered multiple stories, including the arrival of a haunted ship, was incomprehensibly chaotic. Mark Grey supplied a sound design for the amplified voices, as specified by the composer.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON -- One of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges has agreed to pay $100 million to resolve a regulatory lawsuit over its failure to follow U.S. rules while allowing Americans to access its trading platform.<br />BitMEX, which offers leveraged trading in  and other cryptocurrency derivatives, had been sued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission last year. Its four co-founders were separately indicted at the same time for their alleged roles in failing to use an effective anti-money-laundering program. They have pleaded not guilty to criminal charges, and Tuesday’s civil settlement doesn’t resolve their cases.<br />BitMEX, which was incorporated in the Seychelles, has also agreed to prevent U.S. residents from using its trading services, the CFTC said in a press release Tuesday. BitMEX was one of several overseas exchanges, many of them based in Asia, that became popular with traders globally who wanted to bet on cryptocurrency derivatives.<br />Crypto exchanges have increasingly collided with American regulators after years of trying to dodge compliance with many U.S. rules. The Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this week settled a $10 million enforcement action with Poloniex LLC, whose employees had said they wanted to be aggressive about testing the limits of what could be traded without regulatory compliance.<br />Exchanges that offer certain types of derivatives to U.S. investors must be registered with the CFTC, which enforces rules designed to ensure financial responsibility and limit risk. The CFTC said that BitMEX operated U.S. offices and offered American customers the ability to trade unregulated swaps, a type of contract that must be registered with the federal regulator. The swaps included contracts on bitcoin, ether and litecoin, the CFTC said.</td>

      <td>KABUL—Afghanistan’s foreign minister called for international sanctions to be reimposed on Taliban leaders as the insurgent movement seized three more provinces, tightening their grip on the country and preparing for a push on Kabul.<br />With Tuesday’s fall of the capitals of Farah, Baghlan and Badakshan provinces, the Taliban have conquered nine of Afghanistan’s 34 provincial capitals, including important cities such as Kunduz, since Friday. They have also strengthened their circle around the country’s biggest regional hubs of Herat, Kandahar and Mazar-e-Sharif.<br />The offensive violates the commitments that the Taliban gave to the U.S. under the February 2020 Doha agreements that precipitated the U.S. military withdrawal, and warrants a stern international response, Afghan Foreign Minister Haneef Atmar said in an interview. He urged the U.S. and other countries to respond by reinstating United Nations sanctions that had banned Taliban leaders from travel, and by using military force against the group.<br />“The world community should come together to stop Taliban attacks on cities. This is a threat to international peace and security, not just a threat to Afghanistan,” said Mr. Atmar. “Attacks on cities will have destabilizing consequences for the region and the international community—not only by sending refugees but also with the arrival of more foreign fighters to Afghanistan, which will pave the ground for other terrorist groups to come.”<br />The Taliban, he added, are particularly susceptible to renewed sanctions because a significant part of the group’s leadership now lives in the Qatari capital. “The entire world has been deceived by the Taliban,” he added.</td>

      <td>In this film on Apple TV+, co-starring Marlee Matlin, a teenager is torn between her responsibilities as the only hearing member of her family and her wish to nurture her talent for singing.</td>
      <td>In music, a coda is an ending that’s also a variation on the established theme, an unexpected send-off. CODA, on the other hand, stands for Child of Deaf Adults, the one in Siân Heder’s film “CODA” being Ruby Rossi (Emilia Jones), a high schooler for whom music is everything. Is her trajectory going to be a shock? No. But what is surprising is the moving, even heartbreaking, way writer-director Heder tells Ruby’s story without resorting to clichéd characterizations or syrupy sentimentality.<br />Co-starring the deaf actors Marlee Matlin and Troy Kotsur as Ruby’s parents, Jackie and Frank, and Daniel Durant as her brother, Leo, “CODA” is based on a premise as old as movie sound itself—“The Jazz Singer,” after all, was about a performer whose father wanted him to be a cantor, but who defied family tradition and became a pop sensation. In “CODA,” the conflict is less about deaf culture than it is about simple survival: Ruby is the hearing member of the family fishing business in Gloucester, Mass. Without her, the safety net, so to speak, falls apart. But she loves to sing. She’s good. And she has a high-school choir teacher, Bernardo Villalobos (the wonderful Eugenio Derbez), who offers to help her prepare to audition for the Berklee College of Music in not-so-nearby Boston. Crises and conflict ensue.<br />One of the more unorthodox aspects of “CODA” is the salty portrait of Ruby’s family. Her parents are lusty, carnal, gleefully vulgar (perhaps because it grosses Ruby out) and a constant source of embarrassment for a teenager whose classmates seem to have missed the anti-bullying memo: When she first started school, she says, she sounded “like a deaf person.” It was all she’d known. And apparently no one has ever forgotten it.<br />Kids are rotten, it is often said, but they’re particularly rotten in Ms. Heder’s Gloucester, oblivious to Ruby’s burden, why she might smell like fish after working since 3 a.m. or why she falls asleep on her desk in class. When Jackie bemoans the idea that “her baby” might leave home, Frank responds, “She never was a baby”: She’s been the family interpreter all her life, their connection to the hearing world. In a film that doesn’t indulge itself in feeling sorry for anyone, it’s a poignant line and a somewhat shattering moment.<br />Similarly affecting is the scene where Villalobos, or Mr. V, recognizes what he’s got in Ruby (Ms. Jones is far too polished a singer for a high schooler, but you’ll not care). Perhaps because much of “CODA” is rather straightforward and character-plot driven, there are few startling visual moments, but one is a medium shot of Mr. V, in his classroom, regarding Ruby and her talent and being captured by cinematographer Paula Huidobro in a manner that is compositional poetry.</td>

      <td>Businessman and “Shark Tank” fixture Kevin O’Leary may refer to himself as “Mr. Wonderful,” but he does bring a sobering degree of knowledge and disinterest to CNBC’s “Money Court,” the latest variation on legal TV and the noble traditions of Judge Joseph Wapner and Judge Judy. Finance is the name of the game, such as it is, and it’s not only a more serious version of the law-based reality show but virtually begs a viewer to fill in the inevitable holes in the stories.<br />Flanked by two legal authorities—trial lawyer Katie Phang and former judge Ada Pozo—Mr. O’Leary is the final authority before whom complainants, or contestants, or possibly defendants, bring their cases. As we’re told at the outset, the participants have signed a contract stipulating that whatever the show says goes. “I love money,” says Mr. O’Leary, “but there’s nothing I hate more than fighting about it,” which is what everyone is doing who comes on his show.<br />Because everything is about money, pure and simple—rather than, say, divorce, barking dogs or auto accidents—the details don’t always present themselves immediately. On the first episode of “Money Court,” one case involves a brother and sister who bought a Mexican timeshare together, defaulted on the mortgage and lost their investment. But who paid what? It’s hard to call anything regarding “Money Court” a spoiler, since the show is less about plotline than embarrassment and squirming, but it turns out that the brother and sister live together, never opened their mail, and hadn’t visited Mexico in the nine years they owned the time share.<br />Far more intriguing is the show’s first case, which involves a couple named Jared and Karina Rabin, who jointly brought to market a popular product called the Hang-O-Matic, which helps hang pictures, mirrors, etc. Mr. Rabin claims he wants to sell the family home to finance an improved version of the product. Mrs. Rabin is dead set against it. “He’s trying to get rid of assets!” said my viewing companion, convinced that Mr. Rabin had a second family somewhere and what certainly seemed like nefarious intentions—especially since, as Mr. O’Leary sagely explained, there were so many other ways of parlaying purchase orders and credit into producing a new product without selling Mrs. Rabin’s “dream home” out from under her and their kids.<br />Mr. Rabin was innocent of guile, as it turned out, and satisfied with the outcome. Not so my viewing companion. Among the charms of “Money Court,” to judge by episode 1, is the restraint the hosts will have to show as they listen to so much under-capitalized thinking and navigate the fog of money.</td>

Katherine Tai, U.S. trade representative, has been working without any of her three deputy positions filled since taking office in March.<br />The absence of the WTO representative in Geneva, in particular, has been noticed, given Mr. Biden’s pledge to work closely with allies and multilateral organizations after the Trump administration’s go-it-alone trade policy approach fueled tensions with allies, as well as China.<br />“There are a lot of matters that need urgent discussion and focus in Geneva,” said Wendy Cutler, vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute and former senior USTR official, pointing to responses to Covid-19 recovery including the possibility of an intellectual-property waiver for vaccines, e-commerce negotiations and how to deal with China. Having an experienced negotiator like Ms. Pagán will “help the U.S. contribute to finding solutions to a growing list of problems facing the WTO.”</td>
