      <td>The Biden Education Department continues to take heat for its proposed new and restrictive rules for a federal charter school grant program. Protests from parents and a growing number of Democrats are a warning to the Administration that its sneaky push to limit school choice is regressive and unpopular.<br />In a May 5 letter to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, seven U.S. Senators—including Democrats Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), Michael Bennet (Colo.), and Cory Booker (N.J.)—wrote that the rules for applying for the Charter Schools Program funds do “not prioritize the needs of students” and limit “high quality choices to certain families.”</td>

He should take Jerry Seinfeld’s advice to George Costanza and do the opposite of his every policy instinct.<br />The President again called on Congress to pass his Build Back Better, er, sorry, “Building a Better America” plan including more subsidies for green energy, electric cars, child care, housing and more. He also doubled down on his proposed billionaire’s tax—i.e., unconstitutional wealth tax—and Medicare drug price controls.</td>

A congressional source told us that the figure may underestimate the number of U.S. citizens who want to get out, as some want to leave but need to get their affairs in order first.</td>

That includes Shanghai, a crucial commercial hub, which has yet to emerge from restrictions after a month. The government shows little sign of recalibrating even as other countries abandon lockdowns in favor of learning to live with the virus.</td>

      <td>Blanket debt forgiveness would be a massive and unfair transfer of wealth with perverse consequences.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration is reportedly considering expanding its efforts at targeted student debt forgiveness into a broader policy whereby “at least” $10,000 (some have advocated for up to $50,000) in student loans per borrower, possibly subject to an annual income cap, would be eligible for cancellation.<br />There is a rough consensus that rising levels of student-loan debt are a problem, and proponents of debt relief note the aggregate amount outstanding has increased by roughly two-thirds over the past 10 years to a total of some $1.7 trillion. Largely overlooked in the debate are changes made to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 2005, which materially increased the difficulty of discharging student loans in bankruptcy.</td>

      <td>Scholarly studies show that black women are far likelier to terminate their pregnancies than whites.</td>

Wade, abortion was properly viewed as undesirable: the fewer, the better.<br />In the three decades since, the U.S. abortion rate has in fact declined—in recent years it’s fallen to about half of what it was in the early 1980s—yet significant racial disparities persist. In other contexts, group differences in outcome set off alarms on the political left. The racial gap in test scores has brought calls to eliminate the SAT and other admissions tests. The racial gap in arrest and incarceration rates has brought calls to legalize drugs and reduce resources for law enforcement. Racial differences in wealth and income fuel progressive demands for slavery reparations and a larger welfare state. And so on.</td>

The yearslong government pursuit of Microsoft and, before that,  IBM  cost millions and famously ended in whimpers.

      <td>IN 2019, Christian Conner was pondering buying a membership to Soho House, a social club in Manhattan’s Meatpacking District. The then-28-year-old media consultant showed up for a tour of this playground for the hipster elite in his classic “preppy with a twist” uniform—sport coat, trousers and one of his prized Gucci ties. All was going swimmingly, he recalled, until his guide turned to him and said, “Hey, you should take off your tie. We want to create a more casual atmosphere and discourage people from wearing ties.” Mr. Conner was gobsmacked. “I thought, this is crazy. This tie is cool as hell, so why would you tell me not to wear it?” (When asked for comment, a Soho House representative sent a link to the House Rules page of its website which requests that members and guests “keep it casual.”)<br />Interest in ties has been waning for some time, but the last two years of schlubby-comfy pandemic dressing have particularly dimmed their future. Business formal has taken on a near-death mien, and for many months, our collective dance card of tie-required events like weddings, bar mitzvahs and blowout birthday fetes was effectively erased. Even as we’ve approached a new normal, fewer and fewer back-to-the-office and party dress codes call for a smartly knotted tie. Can this once-essential accessory be saved?</td>

In January I wrote that “China’s economic future isn’t looking all that bright and is starting to have political implications for President Xi Jinping.” That turned out to be an understatement.<br />Today China’s economic prospects look significantly weaker than at the beginning of the year, with the International Monetary Fund cutting its forecast for Chinese growth to 4.4% while other economists predict figures below 4%. Capital has been fleeing the country, with foreign investors dumping $18 billion in Chinese bonds and more than $7 billion in Chinese stocks in March alone. What happened? Four things:</td>

In 1986 Dakine had moved to windsurfing-central in Hood River, Ore., and begun years of expansion into bike and snow sports, apparel and more. I discovered the brand nearly 20 years ago, when my then-boyfriend, who had a great eye for accessories, bought himself a Dakine snowboarding bag and matching rolly suitcase in a retro brown-plaid pattern. (The closest match today is the “Status Roller 42L” suitcase and ski bag. The plaid is long gone but romantics can opt for the “Solstice Floral.”) Back then, we were a snowboarder/skier duo, based in Europe, hitting Courchevel, Zermatt, Chamonix.</td>

BP ,   Shell  and  Exxon Mobil  have booked charges of $25.5 billion, $8.4 billion and $3.4 billion respectively, but the major oil companies aren’t the only ones losing money.  General Electric  took a $200 million charge, and  McDonald ’s  is losing $50 million a month from closing its Russian operations. Netflix suspended service in Russia and lost 700,000 viewers, the first time in a decade its viewership has declined.<br />All this is peanuts compared with what might lie ahead should China attempt to invade Taiwan. Trade between the U.S. and China was worth $615 billion in 2020, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. In contrast, U.S.-Russia trade was only worth about $35 billion in 2019. But that disparity in trade volume is only the tip of the iceberg. The stuff we get from China—from antibiotics and smartphones to minerals and metals needed for green technology—is much more important than almost anything we get from Russia. The Biden administration wants to commit the U.S. to a green agenda, but 80% of the rare-earth minerals needed for that technology are processed by China.</td>

For months we sought details. Our charter does not allow rentals for purely political or religious reasons, and this is made clear to anyone who requests to rent our space.

The prospect of inflation is likely to make people even more attuned to their cash, too. A recent survey of about 2,000 U.S. consumers, published by Morgan Stanley analysts on Monday, found that concern about inflation was the highest ever in their survey history. Over 40% of respondents said they would consider opening a new savings account for a rate of 1%, and over 60% would consider it for 2%. Importantly, too, 57% of consumers believe that opening a new account is “simple and worth the effort,” perhaps reflecting the success of financial technology in making action less painful than in past eras.</td>

While the recall didn’t defeat Mr. Newsom, it also didn’t make him politically stronger. Frustration with Covid lockdowns has receded, but anger over the state’s myriad other problems—crime, homelessness, lousy schools, high energy and housing costs and electricity blackouts, among other things—hasn’t waned. Disapproval of Mr. Newsom’s job performance, especially among independents, has risen since the recall.<br />Enter Michael Shellenberger, 50, a former Democrat running for governor as an independent. His political evolution resembles the cartoon recently tweeted by Elon Musk—a stationary guy in the center left of the political spectrum finds himself being pulled to the center right as his fellow liberals sprint the other way. A self-described “eco-modernist,” Mr. Shellenberger has plenty of company in the Golden State. Most Californians aren’t nearly as liberal as the state’s political class, but Republicans have struggled to win statewide in part because their anti-immigrant rhetoric and cultural conservatism have turned off Hispanics and young people. Mr. Shellenberger is testing whether a political moderate running on quality-of-life issues can break the progressive stranglehold on Sacramento. He needs to place second in the state’s jungle primary on June 7 to face off against Mr. Newsom head-to-head in November.</td>

Cost and wage pressures along with a bitterly contested unionization drive at home, and a recent sales collapse in China, the chain’s second-largest market, all weighed on sentiment. But this past Wednesday, the first trading session following the release, the shares surged by nearly 10% in their best day since a sharp rebound in March 2020 following the Covid-19 market panic.

When the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed, we were criticized for being overly optimistic about the effects we predicted it would have. Now the evidence is in. Our critics were wrong, and the economic data have met or even exceeded our predictions.<br />In 2017, we predicted that reducing the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% and introducing full expensing of new-equipment investment would boost productivity-enhancing business investment by 9%. Though growth in business investment had been slowing in the years leading up to 2017, after tax reform it surged. By the end of 2019 it was 9.4% above its pre-2017 trend, exactly in line with the prediction of our models. Looking solely at corporate businesses—those most directly affected by business-tax reform in 2017—real investment was up by as much as 14.2% over the pre-2017 trend, slightly more than we expected. Among S&P 500 companies, total capital expenditures in the two years after tax reform were 20% higher than in the two years prior, when capital expenditures actually declined.</td>

      <td>Old English words can be vaguely familiar and strangely evocative. They conjure a long-ago world of mundane worries and wild imaginings.</td>
      <td>The language now known as Old English arrived in Britain in the fifth century, not long after the end of Roman rule, brought by settlers from northern Germany and southern Scandinavia. It was in use for 700 years, but only about 200 manuscripts containing any Old English survive, mainly from the period between 900 and 1100, and they comprise a total of 3.5 million words—fewer than in the current U.S. tax code. Today most people who engage with Old English do so at college and treat it as a dusty relic of a less enlightened age. Those who have not encountered it tend to imagine it’s the stuff of archaic English pub signs. Worse, they assume it’s the name for the language of Geoffrey Chaucer (which is actually Middle English) or Shakespeare (which is technically Early Modern English, despite student protestations to the contrary).<br />Hana Videen is one of a rare and treasurable breed of enthusiasts who want to remedy such misconceptions. Since the fall of 2013, she has taken to Twitter every day, as @OEWordhord, to post a single example of an Old English word. More than eight years on, the fruit of this slow accumulation is her first book. I doubt that I’m alone in frowning at the proliferation of nonfiction that began life as burblings on social media, and there’s an undelightful subgenre of Twitterature consisting of volumes that merely pile up linguistic trivia. But Ms. Videen is both a passionate medievalist and a relaxed, lucid writer; the pleasure she takes in her subject is infectious.</td>

I could be an insider or I could be an outsider. Outsiders can say whatever they want. But people on the inside don’t listen to them. Insiders, however, get lots of access and a chance to push their ideas. People—powerful people—listen to what they have to say. But insiders also understand one unbreakable rule: They don’t criticize other insiders.”<br />Want to see this in action? In his 2021 book, “A Plague Upon Our House,” about his time as an adviser to the Trump administration on Covid-19, the Hoover Institution’s Scott Atlas describes “a functioning troika of ‘medical experts’ composed of Drs. Birx, Fauci, and Redfield.” He “noticed that there was virtually no disagreement among them. It was an amazing consistency, as though there were an agreed-upon complicity—even though some of their statements were so patently simplistic or erroneous.” Loyalty! But was that for the best?

      <td>Investors might not be aware when their advisers have ties to insurance companies</td>
      <td><br />Since the 2008 financial crisis tarnished big Wall Street banks and brokers, the ranks of independent wealth advisers have grown faster than other categories.

The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against a basket of others, is reaching highs unseen since 2002. The greenback’s climb has sent the euro, British pound and Japanese yen tumbling.</td>
