Och and his onetime protégé, Chief Executive James Levin. Mr. Levin became CEO of the firm, formerly known as  Och-Ziff Capital Management ,  after a pitched succession battle in 2018 that led Mr. Och to step back.</td>

Most world leaders showed up, including U.S. President George W. Bush. The world still hoped that China was evolving into a more politically open government that would play by international rules. Current President Xi Jinping had yet to take control.</td>

The world is now a slightly better place, and the lessons of the successful operation are worth recounting.<br />Administration officials who briefed the press said Hajji Abdullah, as al-Qurayshi was known, detonated a suicide bomb and killed members of his own family as U.S. troops approached. His ISIS predecessor killed himself in the same way in 2019 rather than be captured, so the U.S story is plausible.</td>

My precious 19-year-old Krystal also was killed in crossfire in 2004, after she made the fatal decision to stop for gas. In those terrible moments when I’m taken back to that night, I can’t breathe.<br />In 2021, 311 American children under 12 were shot and killed. But I haven’t seen anyone marching in the streets demanding justice or declaring that their innocent lives mattered. On New Year’s Day, the 4-year-old niece of George Floyd was shot and wounded as she slept in her bed. Will anyone remember baby Grayson’s name besides his family, who must now find a way to live with their emptiness and grief? How can we tolerate these kinds of deaths in our communities? Why is there no outrage?</td>

The 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and the recent Texas hostage standoff shock us, yet they have become customary.<br />The pretext of the “new” anti-Semitism is hatred of Israel, which justifies Jew hatred anywhere. Other forms, like the popularity of “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” endure. Jews are said to have a plan to dominate the world, spread drugs and venereal diseases, and much else. The crimes of capitalism and communism alike are blamed on Jews. Anti-Semitism is resurgent on the political right, which feels alienated from governing institutions. And the most refined anti-Semitism continues to be taught on university campuses.</td>

I had heard the voices of political dissidents, human-rights lawyers, Tibetans, Uyghurs and practitioners of Falun Gong—a spiritual discipline that was wildly popular in China before being banned in 1999—who called for boycotting the Olympics.

      <td>Sci-fi adventures with spectacular production designs are often hailed for what’s called their world-building. The term is apt in an emotional sense for Joachim Trier’s “The Worst Person in the World,” in Norwegian with English subtitles. This vibrant, buoyant drama, intimate in scope instead of vast, takes us to Oslo—not exactly another planet, but an adventure all the same—where it builds a world of mercurial passions while its enchanting heroine, Julie (Renate Reinsve), belatedly and erratically comes of age over the course of several years. And you don’t see a single flake of snow on the screen, only the magically soft light of the city in summer, and finally fall. (The film is playing in New York and Los Angeles before expanding to other cities next week.)<br />The title is ironic, of course. Rather than the disappointment she believes herself to be, Julie has only been a rambler, a nimble drifter through the conflicting possibilities of her life. Ms. Reinsve is magnificent in the role, her radiant face a registry of unsettled feelings. It’s a great performance by any measure, and finds its complement in Anders Danielsen Lie’s beautifully nuanced portrayal of Aksel, an underground comic-book artist who is older and far more grounded than Julie, but basks in the warmth of her volatile love.</td>

The abductors who pounce on their victim and stuff him violently into a suitcase wear revoltingly cheery face masks—all caricatures of the Royal Family. That victim, Leo Newman (Gerran Howell), is the 20-ish son of Katherine Newman, prominent American head of a high-powered U.S. public-relations firm (a thoroughly persuasive Uma Thurman) now on her way to take up her new role as U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom.</td>

      <td>The moon drops out of orbit and threatens Earth in the latest disaster epic from Roland Emmerich.</td>
      <td>Everything else seems to be falling out of orbit these days, so why not the moon? That’s what happens in “Moonfall,” a zestfully ludicrous disaster epic from Roland Emmerich, the man who gave us “Independence Day” (alien attack) and “The Day After Tomorrow” (climate change, Earth freezes over) and “Godzilla” (Manhattan’s Flatiron Building gets flattened, the Chrysler Building falls to friendly fire). After two years of Covid-19 restrictions and theater closures, zestfully ludicrous may be just the ticket for a film that’s showing nationally on big and bigger screens. (I saw it in IMAX, so I can vouch for the bigness, plus the loudness.) The question is whether it’s ludicrous enough, and the answer is perhaps, but no better than perhaps. The film is less like a full-fledged story than a series of notifications you might get on your phone, most of them couched in language that could have been generated by a buggy AI program.<br />If anyone can save our planet it’s a trio consisting of Jo Fowler (Halle Berry), a former astronaut and current NASA honcho; Brian Harper (Patrick Wilson), a wrongly disgraced former astronaut; and K.C. Houseman (John Bradley, from “Game of Thrones”), a conspiracy theorist, fast-food counterperson and unheralded genius who is faster than NASA in detecting a fateful lunar perturbation. K.C. gets most of the intentional laughs, such as they are, but Brian, whose career and domestic life are in disarray, has the best unintentional laugh line. It comes when he’s asked to fly a moon mission like no other, as only he can fly it. By this time Earth is already in chaos, what with cities beset by titanic tides (though with no noticeable loss of life), and the moon is about to break into planet-killing pieces. But Brian’s deadpan reply is “I don’t know, I’ve got a lot of my own problems down here.”</td>

Let’s get some things straight.<br />First, language has small and large impacts day to day. Language reflects the world around us and influences how we feel and think. Take “illegal alien”: This term brands a person “illegal” and implies they’re not human but “alien.” Beyond dehumanizing, the term is imprecise: It implies criminality, but lacking immigration documents is a civil, not criminal, offense. In Rwanda, some Hutus referred to Tutsis as “cockroaches” on popular radio stations. The intentional repetition of dehumanizing terms turned many Hutus against Tutsi neighbors, resulting in the 1994 genocide.</td>

A study I did with University of Kentucky economist Aaron Yelowitz found that 1 in 7 Californians with income above eligibility levels reported enrollment in Medicaid in 2017.<br />ObamaCare’s Medicaid expansion deserves much of the blame, since Washington pays nearly the entire cost of spending on expansion enrollees. A recent federal audit examined 2,301 files of people enrolled under ObamaCare’s expansion, and eligibility review errors occurred in 29% of them. About half were caseworker mistakes, about a quarter were “system failures,” and the rest couldn’t be determined.</td>

It’s the right decision with more than 100,000 Russian troops along Ukraine’s borders.<br />A Pentagon spokesman said Wednesday that some 1,000 American troops based in Germany will soon shift to Romania and about 2,000 will leave the U.S. for Poland and Germany. “These are not permanent moves,” a Pentagon spokesman stressed Wednesday. “These forces are not going to fight in Ukraine.”</td>

      <td>The U.K. ditches a diktat for health staff as other leaders rethink how to live with the virus.</td>
      <td>The Biden Administration isn’t the only government rethinking Covid vaccine mandates. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration quietly dropped its mandate after a rebuke from the Supreme Court, and some leaders in Europe are also finally getting serious about learning to live with the virus.<br />United Kingdom Health Secretary Sajid Javid on Monday scrapped a requirement for employees of the National Health Service (NHS) to be vaccinated by April. Doctors, nurses and other staff would have had to receive their first shots this week to be fully vaccinated in time and it became clear tens of thousands were holding out, amounting to more than 5% of the NHS work force. This amid chronic staff shortages.</td>

Only Alma’s two daughters, masked and gowned, were allowed in with their mother as she lay in a hospital bed, sedated and intubated. Then doctors and nurses removed her life-maintaining support. A short time later she died, holding her daughters’ hands.<br />Her siblings and grandchildren watched the end from the hospital chapel via Zoom on a borrowed laptop, praying it was a peaceful, painless passing.</td>

As an adviser to Yale in the 1970s, I recommended that it make its first venture-capital investment. I gave similar advice to Harvard and other universities.<br />In 1985, David Swensen began his 36-year career as Yale’s chief investment officer and became the most successful institutional investor of his era. He greatly increased Yale’s allocation to venture funds and buyout funds. He also expressed to me his view that venture funds and buyout funds generally raised too much money and charged excessive fees.</td>

      <td>The average venture-capital fund launched in 2011 outperformed the S&P 500 by 7% per year. But that statistic understates the astronomical returns earned by a few top performers—and the mediocre returns earned by the rest. Between 1979 and 2018, the median fund underperformed the S&P 500, while the top 5% of funds nearly tripled the index’s performance.<br />The investor Bill Gurley, of Benchmark, describes venture capital as a “grand-slam business.” In “The Power Law,” business journalist Sebastian Mallaby argues that venture is defined by its most extravagant successes. A few deals explain the majority of returns, a few funds drive the majority of asset-class performance, a few wild ideas change the world.</td>

      <td>A federal jury began deliberations in the fraud trial of Michael Avenatti Wednesday afternoon after the disgraced celebrity lawyer and prosecutors clashed over whether he fleeced his former client Stormy Daniels out of money from a book deal.<br />Mr. Avenatti, who is serving as his own lawyer, said during closing arguments that he was an advocate and champion for Ms. Daniels in her legal fights with then-President Donald Trump in 2018. He told jurors in Manhattan that his work entitled him to a percentage of her $800,000 book advance, saying her claims that he stole from her weren’t credible.</td>
