Either way, the company formerly known as Facebook—under a new name and bound for a new destination—has the same captain. And he will be fully responsible for the voyage from this point onward.<br />In a Facebook post on Wednesday, Ms. Sandberg said she was stepping down from her role as  Meta ’s  chief operating officer after 14 years at the company. Her stated reason was to focus more on her family and philanthropic work, but the move comes at a delicate time for an advertising business that she headed—and still accounts for 97% of the company’s revenue.</td>

We suppose that’s progress, but the return of soaring prices after a 40-year hiatus is also an historic policy failure that is worth recounting. It represents a failure of progressive expertise that is a lesson for the future.<br />“I think I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNN on Tuesday, referring to a 2021 comment that there was a “small risk” of inflation. “There have been unanticipated and large shocks to the economy that have boosted energy and food prices and supply bottlenecks that have affected our economy badly that I, at the time, didn’t fully understand, but we recognize that now.”</td>

Could this be an entertainment phenomenon that says something larger about the current moment in American culture?<br />No doubt many are showing up to see Tom Cruise, who plays U.S. Navy fighter pilot Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, as he did in the original “Top Gun” in 1986. But the movie’s opening weekend outperformed the box office for Mr. Cruise’s other hits such as the “Mission: Impossible” franchise. It’s no easy feat to stick the landing of a sequel more than three decades after the first movie.</td>

Apparently Canadian politics is too boring, or parochial, or something, because he also vowed to defend abortion rights after the draft Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade was leaked.

Today’s troubles, the tune teaches, become tomorrow’s treasures.<br />This wise counsel has classical roots.

Looking back on her experience of the U.S. and its people during 70 years as monarch, she might note how little has changed. Her first prime minister, Winston Churchill, had an American mother. Her current prime minister, Boris Johnson, was born in New York and only renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2016. Today as in the 1950s, Britain is bickering with France, and is allied tightly with the U.S. against Russia. One of the queen’s relatives—not her uncle Edward VIII, but her grandson Prince Harry—is complaining in the American media that his family doesn’t understand him.<br />Since the queen’s accession in 1952, links between the U.S. and U.K. have intensified at every level, from military and intelligence coordination to politics, finance and entertainment. Two of the last three presidents are children of subjects of her father George VI: Barack Obama on his father’s side and Donald Trump on his mother’s. Prince Harry’s marriage to Meghan Markle continues the trans-Atlantic merging that has been going on since Randolph Churchill married Brooklyn-born Jennie Jerome.

      <td>If it turns out to be a law clerk, there are federal statutes under which criminal charges can be brought.</td>
      <td>The leak of a draft Supreme Court opinion to a Politico reporter in May was a historic betrayal of the bench. Investigators reportedly are taking steps to obtain phone records and affidavits from the justices’ law clerks. If the leaker turns out to be a law clerk, he or she will be so ethically compromised that a career in the law will almost certainly be out of reach. Most commentators agree that federal law doesn’t criminalize such court leaks. We see things differently.<br />Working in the chambers of a federal judge—whether on the Supreme Court or elsewhere—is for good reason considered the best first job a law school graduate can land. Thousands of highly qualified law students typically apply for a single slot. The job affords entrance into an elite circle, and promises to open professional doors and provide credibility during the new attorney’s career. But this honor comes with the solemn institutional expectation that what happens in chambers stays in chambers. Justice Antonin Scalia had a reputation for not mincing words on the subject. He warned incoming classes of law clerks that he would do “everything in [his] power” to “ruin” the career of any law clerk who betrayed his confidences.</td>

      <td>Having practiced law for 45 years, and taught law for 25 of them, I can assure you that lawyers have to know how to think in a particular way that is unique to the profession. Law schools need an objective tool to measure whether an applicant has that capability. For decades, the LSAT has been such a tool (“Law Group Proposes LSATs Be Optional,” Page One, May 21). The recommendation of the ABA panel is an irresponsible and unrealistic example of virtue signaling. It’s nice to have a diverse population of lawyers.

The mass shootings last month in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, N.Y., carried out by 18-year-old gunmen, have heightened fears that something’s gone horribly wrong. But the problem isn’t new. American psychiatrists have been studying rates of functional mental illness, such as depressive disorders and schizophrenia, since the 1840s. These studies show that the ratio of those suffering from such diseases to the mentally healthy population has been consistently rising.<br />Ten years ago, based on the annual Healthy Minds study of college students, 1 in 5 college students was dealing with mental illness. Between 2013 and 2021, according to Healthy Minds, the share of U.S. college students affected by depression surged 135%. During the same period, the share of students afflicted by any psychiatric illness doubled to more than 40%. “America’s youth,” wrote journalist Neal Freyman in April, “are in the midst of a spiking mental health crisis, and public health experts are racing to identify the root causes before it gets even worse.”</td>

Three years ago, on the 20th anniversary of the Columbine High School shooting in Littleton, Colo., the  New York Times  published an article noting that public perceptions of school safety are largely at odds with what the data show.<br />“The unique horror of mass shootings,” the Times reported, “means they occupy a central place in parents’ fears, and in the nation’s political debate about gun access and school safety, even though they remain rare.” Most gun-related deaths—54% in 2020—are suicides. Mass shooting casualties are less than 1% of all gun deaths, and there have been 13 mass school shootings since 1966. These data points are cold comfort to those mourning the shooting victims in Uvalde, but they ought to inform any public policy response under consideration.</td>

      <td>Many Americans are understandably tired of prayers to end mass shootings. Familiar platitudes such as “thoughts and prayers to the families” seem hollow when offered without clear policy proposals. But the presence of prayer preserves the urgency for action and has since America’s inception.<br />In 1865, amid the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated to his second term as president. He delivered one of the shortest but most memorable inaugural addresses in our nation’s history. “Fondly do we hope,” he famously said, “fervently do we pray—that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.”</td>

Inaction would lead to the same “incredible harm to your Church that the Catholic Church did not avoid.”<br />Fr. Doyle’s warning went unheeded, a fact that Southern Baptist leaders must now regret. Last week a 288-page report on sex abuse commissioned by the convention charged its leaders with myriad failures over the past 20 years.

Many Poles with tech experience are being snapped up by companies in Europe and even in the U.S. The Polish government’s website offers an extraordinarily friendly welcome: “Are you an engineer or do you have experience in the IT sector? Are you considering relocating to Poland? We will help you fast-track the immigration procedure, allowing you to enter Poland together with your family.” The welcome is part of a Polish-government launch last year that saw the country inviting Belarusian tech experts to meet its demand for tech workers. When the visa was launched, Poland had a shortage of about 50,000 tech workers, with the number expected to double within the next 10 years if nothing is done.</td>

There were no first-person-shooter videogames and there was a lot less violence in the media.

Rodgers’s op-ed “Tariffs Throw Shade on the Solar Industry” (May 25): Since antidumping and countervailing duties were instituted in 2012 and 2014, and “safeguard” tariffs in 2018, growth in the U.S. solar industry has outpaced all projections while prices fell. U.S.-based solar manufacturing grew strongly, accounting for nearly 20% of U.S. consumption. This year’s price increase in solar panels is due to supply-chain snafus, shipping-cost increases and excessive dependence on Asian supplies, not tariffs.<br />Experience since 2018 shows that a simple, comprehensive tariff policy limiting the penetration of subsidized Chinese solar products can support the healthy growth of the U.S. industry. But Chinese solar manufacturers, led and orchestrated by the Communist Party, are resourceful. They now rely on facilities in Southeast Asia to evade U.S. tariffs. The U.S. solar installers who want to make the U.S. dependent on cheap Chinese solar equipment—manufactured with slave labor and produced with coal-fired electricity—are playing into the hands of the Chinese government.</td>

It should be recognized, however, that such shameless use of one’s expert reputation is not limited to former government officials.<br />Consider a recent example from academia: In September 2021, 17 winners of the Nobel Prize in economics issued an open letter in support of the massive, $4 trillion to $5 trillion Build Back Better bill, claiming that it would lower inflation in the long run. Just imagine what our current short-run inflation problems would be if this bill had been enacted.
