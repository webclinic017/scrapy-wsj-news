      <td>Move aims to improve transparency at agency that has reported rise in use-of-force incidents by its officers</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration will begin outfitting some Border Patrol agents with body cameras, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Wednesday.<br />The move, which has been under discussion since the Obama administration, will for the first time require thousands of agents patrolling the border, as well as officers at ports of entry, to wear cameras the size of a deck of playing cards on the front of their uniforms. It will equip the Border Patrol with a new tool to investigate violent incidents and possible misconduct on the part of its agents.<br />Body cameras will first be rolled out along sections of the southern border in West Texas and New Mexico, according to two officials familiar with the plan. The government expects to outfit 6,000 agents with cameras by the end of this year.<br />In a statement, acting CBP Commissioner Troy Miller said the step is an attempt to improve accountability within the agency and build trust with the public.<br />“Providing [agents] with state-of-the-art technology and tools like body-worn cameras will support their work and provide greater transparency into interactions between CBP officers and agents and the public,” he said.</td>

      <td>Ride-hailing company still expects to reach a measure of profitability by fourth quarter despite driver shortage, Delta variant concerns</td>
      <td>Uber Technologies Inc.’s  ridership rebounded strongly in the most recent quarter from last year’s pandemic lows, but a continuing driver shortage and uncertainty about how the Delta variant will affect consumer behavior pushed its shares lower.<br />The company said Wednesday its adjusted loss excluding tax, interest and some costs narrowed to $509 million in the second quarter from $837 million in the year-earlier period. Analysts polled by FactSet expected an adjusted loss before items of $322 million. Uber spent money in the quarter on incentives to woo drivers amid a shortage that has driven up passenger fares. Its shares fell more than 5% in after-hours trading.<br />Rival  Lyft Inc.  on Tuesday turned its first quarterly profit on that basis. The company hit that milestone a quarter earlier than expected, in part because ridership rebounded and it reined in costs.<br />Uber’s rides business is profitable by that measure, but its bottom line is dragged down by its capital-intensive food-delivery business. The company said it sees its loss by that measure narrowing to less than $100 million in the current quarter, and that it remains on track to post a profit by that measure by the fourth quarter.<br />Uber is among the companies that were both walloped by the pandemic, as cities went into lockdown and ridership plummeted, and benefited from people stuck at home turning in record numbers to food delivery. Easing pandemic restrictions boosted Uber’s rides business in the second quarter, but rising Covid-19 infections could damp prospects in the near-future.</td>

      <td>Where’s the uproar about the erosion of democratic norms?</td>
      <td>When Donald Trump took action that exceeded his authority, all of Washington erupted in protest. Yet that is exactly what President Biden did Tuesday, when his Administration reissued a nationwide eviction moratorium after the White House had argued at length that it lacked legal authority to do so. The Beltway response? Crickets.<br />“The bulk of the constitutional scholarship says that it’s not likely to pass constitutional muster,” Mr. Biden admitted Tuesday. That was only hours before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued its renewed eviction ban. “But at a minimum,” Mr. Biden said, “by the time it gets litigated, it will probably give some additional time while we’re getting that $45 billion out to people who are, in fact, behind in the rent and don’t have the money.”<br />Many Presidents have overstepped their authority, but this is premeditated lawlessness. The government has been slow to distribute pandemic relief funds to renters. Now to buy time and silence Democratic critics, Mr. Biden has signed off on an order that he admits he can’t defend in good faith.<br />The CDC’s original eviction ban, issued last September under President Trump, was extensively litigated before it expired on July 31. Five federal courts, including an appellate panel at the Sixth Circuit, ruled against it. A few courts went the other way, saying that landlords hadn’t met the burden required for a preliminary injunction. But the judicial score was lopsided against the moratorium.<br />In justifying the ban, the government cited the Public Health Service Act of 1944. To halt disease, that law says the CDC may require “inspection, fumigation, disinfection, sanitation, pest extermination,” and so forth, with a final catchall phrase for “other measures.” The feds argued this was enough legal authority. But the gap between “fumigation” and “other measures” isn’t big enough for the government to shove in a ban that applies to nearly every residence in America, punishable by a year in jail.</td>

      <td>His attempt at political accommodation invited the latest Biden abuse.</td>
      <td>Nearby we dissect the Biden Administration’s lawless new ban on rental evictions, and the episode has a lesson for the Supreme Court.<br />Key to the fiasco is a 5-4 Supreme Court order at the end of June. A lower court had ruled that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s nationwide eviction moratorium—then in effect without congressional authorization—was unlawful, but granted a stay pending appeal. Five High Court Justices agreed the CDC action wasn’t legally justified, but one of the five—Justice Brett Kavanaugh—offered a political olive branch.<br />Justice Kavanaugh agreed that the CDC “exceeded its existing statutory authority,” but he noted the agency “plans to end the moratorium in only a few weeks.” Therefore, he voted to leave the stay in place until the end of July, when the moratorium expired. He invited Congress to extend the moratorium through legislation if it wished. Congress failed.<br />Perhaps Justice Kavanaugh hoped his June concession on the law would improve governance. He wrote that “those few weeks will allow for additional and more orderly distribution of the congressionally appropriated rental assistance funds.” But that’s not the judiciary’s job. It’s the responsibility of the executive branch and state governments.<br />The Biden Administration responded to Justice Kavanaugh’s concession first by blaming him for saying the ban is illegal and then reinstating it anyway. So much for returning the favor. Meanwhile, Congress and state legislatures continue to evade political responsibility for their decisions on rental policy.</td>

      <td>The press corps seems bored with the Senate’s 2,700-page infrastructure bill since it’s destined to pass. But the bill is more consequential than the coverage, and one theme in particular deserves more attention. The bill is a major down payment on President Biden’s Green New Deal.<br />The Senate bill is a great leap forward for progressive ambitions to use central planning to re-engineer the electrical grid and banish carbon from the U.S. economy. The bill helps this political medicine go down by offering large subsidies that have co-opted the business lobbies.<br />Start with the $21.5 billion for the Energy Department’s new Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, otherwise known as Secretary Jennifer Granholm’s green-energy venture-capital fund. Ms. Granholm knows this territory, having made many failed renewable-energy bets as Governor of Michigan—including A123 Systems, Fisker Automotive and various solar manufacturers.<br />Now she will get tens of billions of dollars to bet on even more energy projects. This includes $2.4 billion for advanced nuclear reactor projects, $3.5 billion for carbon capture, $8 billion for “clean hydrogen” and $5 billion for projects that “demonstrate innovative approaches to transmission, storage, and distribution infrastructure to harden and enhance resilience and reliability.”<br />Government bureaucrats will decide what counts as “innovative.” This isn’t betting solely on pure research that the private economy won’t do. It’s backing specific technologies and business models. But if projects are innovative, why do they need government investment? Start-ups are receiving record amounts of private capital as institutional investors seek higher returns.</td>

      <td>China is now purging Hong Kong teachers who resist its propaganda.</td>
      <td>China wants the world to forget about its political takeover of Hong Kong, but we’ll try to keep you as informed as we can. The latest news is the imposition of a Communist Party-friendly curriculum in the city’s schools.<br />On Saturday the Education Bureau said it will no longer recognize the Hong Kong Professional Teachers’ Union, which has 95,000 members and is more a guild than a union in the American sense. The Education Bureau says the union has been “engaging in political propaganda under the guise of being a professional education organisation.” But authorities’ real fear is that teachers will resist imposing Beijing’s “patriotic education” on Hong Kong students.<br />The new national security law directs Hong Kong to “promote national security education in schools and universities.” The Education Bureau is revamping the curriculum so students develop “a sense of belonging to the country, an affection for the Chinese people, a sense of national identity, as well as an awareness of and a sense of responsibility for safeguarding national security.” Public libraries have removed the books of pro-democracy figures.<br />Thus the purge of teachers. Authorities took particular issue with the union’s longtime alliance with groups that organized peaceful pro-democracy protests and annual Tiananmen vigils. Authorities have warned teachers and students that political expression in classrooms or on campus may violate the national security law. The maximum penalty is life in prison.<br />In May the union reported that nearly one in five teachers surveyed said they planned to leave the profession. Most said the reason was “increased political pressure.”</td>

Federal lawmakers are proposing up to $7.5 billion for states and municipalities to build electric-vehicle charging stations as part of the infrastructure bill moving through the Senate.<br />Along with the electric-vehicle targets, auto industry officials expect the White House to announce rules mandating a 3.7% annual increase in fuel efficiency for the next two years. The White House and other federal officials declined to comment on the fuel targets.</td>

      <td>Is the optimal strategy in ride-hailing growth or profits? Investors can’t have it both ways.<br />After  Lyft  said it achieved profitability on the basis of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization on Tuesday, Uber said Wednesday that its losses deepened sequentially on that basis as it made investments in driver recovery. Shares of Lyft fell more than 9% the day after its report while Uber’s shares fell 8% in after-hours trading immediately following the release of its second quarter results.<br />Investors have become uncomfortable with ride-hailing companies paying dearly to compete for the same riders as they work to grow their market share. Now they are paying to compete for the same drivers as they work to rebuild their supply after the pandemic decimated ride-hailing demand.<br />They may not be investing equally. Lyft said it significantly increased its investments in incentives and sign-on bonuses to boost its driver base in the second quarter, expecting elevated incentives to continue into the third quarter. But Uber appears to have been more aggressive. While the company reported overall revenue that beat Wall Street’s estimate, it also lost 58% more than analysts had forecast on an adjusted Ebitda basis.<br />At this point, it is still unclear which company’s investment strategy is yielding the most bang for its buck. Lyft said its rideshare rides in the second quarter were still “well below” the levels reached in the fourth quarter of 2019. While not a perfect comparison, Uber’s second quarter trips—a reflection of both supply and demand—were down just over 20% from the same period.</td>

      <td>Neither arms control nor military force is realistic. What would a more practical policy look like?</td>
      <td>Mohammad Khatami, an affable, intellectual cleric who believed in the Islamic revolution but wanted more humanity and democracy in government, unexpectedly won the Iranian presidential election on May 23, 1997. His victory marked the beginning of the Western left’s conviction that the clerical regime was evolving into a less religious and oppressive system.<br />But that isn’t panning out. Ebrahim Raisi, a cleric renowned for his ruthlessness, became president this week and is the apparent successor to Ali Khamenei as supreme leader. Joe Biden may be forced to answer a question presidents have preferred to avoid: Would Washington use force to stop the development of Iranian nuclear weapons? American presidents since 2002, when the Islamic Republic’s clandestine atomic program was revealed, have declared that Iran’s possessing such arms is unacceptable.<br />President Biden appears unprepared to unleash the U.S. Air Force, and the administration can’t plausibly argue that opening up more trade hurts the theocracy’s aggressive, Islamist ambitions. This leaves few options beyond economic penalties. The White House probably doesn’t appreciate the irony of its now reportedly contemplating leveling more sanctions on Tehran to coerce Mr. Khamenei to re-enter the nuclear deal, after Mr. Biden and his Iran team derided the sanctions diplomacy of Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign.<br />The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, with its sunset clauses and nonchalance about aggressive inspections, made sense as an arms-control agreement if the accord was merely one step in a process. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has, in his own way, stated exactly this, endorsing the need to make the agreement “longer, stronger, broader.” That wouldn’t be necessary if the JCPOA actually stopped, as former Secretary of State John Kerry put it, “all pathways” to the bomb and did something about the theocracy’s ballistic missiles and imperialism.<br />Messrs. Raisi and Khamenei have made it crystal clear, however, there will be no follow-on talks. By rejoining the Iran nuclear deal, Washington would at best be giving tens of billions of dollars in sanctions relief to the clerical regime for a short-term fix. Iran has already started building advanced centrifuges; with the JCPOA, Tehran can build 400 advanced machines in two years and put rotors into them in four. Even as a mechanism to kick the can down the road, the nuclear deal no longer makes much sense.</td>

      <td>Booting GOP choices was an unprecedented step that makes the body look partisan.</td>
      <td>The testimony last week before the House Select Committee on the Jan. 6 attack by Capitol and D.C. police officers was riveting. Their description of that day’s events demolished claims by some Republicans that the assault on Congress wasn’t very different from a “normal tourist visit” or a peaceful protest. Unfortunately, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has made building a national consensus on what happened needlessly difficult.<br />The country needs a sober, accurate assessment of that day’s events, as well as vigorous prosecution of anyone who took part in the attempt to derail the joint congressional session’s certification of the presidential election—particularly those who assaulted police and breached the Capitol.<br />To that end, the Jan. 6 Select Committee can still accomplish much, but it’s laboring under a cloud generated by Mrs. Pelosi’s rejection of two of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s nominees to the panel—Reps. Jim Banks (R., Ind.) and Jim Jordan (R., Ohio)—for what she called “statements and actions” that gave her concerns “with respect for the integrity of the investigation.” Both Republicans questioned the conduct of last year’s election and opposed certification of some states’ electoral votes for President Biden.<br />Even the speaker admitted her action was “unprecedented,” since each party normally picks its select committee members. Her decision led Mr. McCarthy to withdraw all his picks. Having already named Rep. Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.) to the panel, the Speaker then added Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R., Ill.). Both will be fine members. (Full disclosure: Ms. Cheney and Mr. Kinzinger are friends to whose campaigns I’ve contributed.)<br />Still, Mrs. Pelosi has made the Select Committee appear more partisan than it should be. Skeptical voters will rightly ask: If objecting to an election outcome based on absurd theories and wild allegations was enough to disqualify someone for the Jan. 6 Select Committee, why is Rep. Bennie Thompson (D., Miss.) chairing it?</td>

      <td>Much of the pathology underlying Covid policy arises from the fantasy that it is possible to eradicate the virus. Capitalizing on pandemic panic, governments and compliant media have used the lure of zero-Covid to induce obedience to harsh and arbitrary lockdown policies and associated violations of civil liberties.<br />Among all countries, New Zealand, Australia and especially China have most zealously embraced zero-Covid. China’s initial lockdown in Wuhan was the most tyrannical. It infamously locked people into their homes, forced patients to take untested medications, and imposed 40-day quarantines at gunpoint.<br />On March 24, 2020, New Zealand imposed one of the most onerous lockdowns in the free world, with sharp restrictions on international travel, business closures, a prohibition on going outside, and official encouragement of citizens to snitch on neighbors. In May 2020, having hit zero-Covid, New Zealand lifted lockdown restrictions, except quarantines for international travelers and warrantless house searches to enforce lockdown.<br />Australia also took the zero-Covid route. While the initial steps focused on banning international travel, the lockdowns there also involved closed schools, occasional separation of mothers from premature newborns, brutal suppression of protests, and arrests for wandering more than 3 miles from home.<br />New Zealand’s and Australia’s temporary achievement of zero-Covid and China’s claimed success were greeted with fanfare by the media and scientific journals. China’s authoritarian response seemed so successful—despite the country’s record of lying about the virus—that panicked democratic governments around the world copied it. The three countries lifted their lockdowns and celebrated.</td>

It happens. Some years ago, four-time All-Star second baseman Chuck Knoblauch became unable to throw a ball accurately to first base. He saved his career by moving to the outfield. Ms. Biles returned to the balance beam this week and won a bronze medal.<br />What still remains is the same two-word problem—mental health—cited at the French Open for unable-to-cope tennis star Naomi Osaka (“it’s O.K. to not be O.K.”) or countless anonymous American kids. The coronavirus pandemic will recede eventually. The mental-health pandemic won’t.<br />The buildup to her Tokyo appearance gave the impression that Simone Biles’s Olympics career was on the cusp of a fairy-tale ending. So let’s enter the mess that became her Olympics through the door of a fairy tale.<br />Once upon a time, in a faraway land called Harvard University, a young man named Mark Zuckerberg came upon the idea of using the internet so students in college could connect easily and instantly with friends. It was a wonderful idea, a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow that let Mark live in a magical place called Silicon Valley.</td>

Trevelyan, is called “If Napoleon Had Won the Battle of Waterloo”; the biographer Milton Waldman imagines “If Booth Had Missed Lincoln.”<br />Counterfactuals serve as an important thinking tool in the deeper exploration of causal connections and alternate scenarios. The Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy defines a counterfactual as “a conditional statement in which the ‘if’ clause makes a claim contrary to fact, stated grammatically in a subjunctive mood, that is, expressing a wish or desire.”<br />In “The Science of Can and Can’t,” the theoretical physicist Chiara Marletto explores the power and possibility of thinking through counterfactuals in science. She makes the point that “the counterfactuals that matter to science and physics, and that have so far been neglected, are facts about what could or could not be made to happen to physical systems; about what is possible or impossible.” In her view, counterfactuals are “fundamental because they express essential features of the laws of physics—the rules that govern every system in the universe.” They provide the means to perform new kinds of thought experiments, to follow the chain of causation and to probe the true nature of reality more deeply.<br />What is tricky about counterfactuals, however, is that they are often untestable. So what is their utility in science? Ms. Marletto, a research fellow at the University of Oxford, contrasts the steam engine with the perpetual motion machine. “The possibility of building a steam engine, which existed long before the first one was actually built, is a counterfactual.” Meanwhile, “a counterfactual property imposed by the laws of physics is that it is impossible to build a perpetual motion machine.”<br />As Ms. Marletto points out, we can make claims about the truth of counterfactuals in certain circumstances—if we permit ourselves to entertain the idea of “possible worlds” or alternate universes. But this gets complicated when it comes to the matter of contingency, when the possibility of one event predicates the occurrence of another. Ms. Marletto’s counterfactuals in physics, for example, are restricted to possible worlds that inevitably obey physical laws similar to our own. She might have been more effective in making her case had she embraced the idea of a multiverse, which permits infinite possibilities and is by definition broader in its explanatory scope. In science, most if not all claims are experimentally testable; the multiverse, however, is not—hence the concept is somewhat controversial.</td>

      <td>Edward Bases and John Pacilio were convicted of rigging precious-metals prices after a criminal trial in Chicago</td>
      <td>Two former  Bank of America Corp.  traders were convicted Wednesday of rigging precious-metals prices by using an aggressive tactic known as spoofing, the latest win for prosecutors in a yearslong effort to crack down on the practice.<br />A federal jury found Edward Bases and John Pacilio guilty of wire fraud and conspiracy charges after a two-week criminal trial in Chicago. The proceeding was a test of prosecutors’ efforts to punish spoofing activity that predated a law defining the tactic and making it illegal.<br />Prosecutors argued that trading by Messrs. Bases and Pacilio on futures exchanges operated by  CME Group Inc.  was deceptive, allowing the government to charge the conduct as fraud. Lawyers for the defendants argued that their style of trading was allowed before the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law prohibited spoofing.<br />Spoofing involves sending deceptive orders that can mislead traders into thinking supply and demand have changed, according to regulators and prosecutors. The mirage, which some traders and attorneys argue is lawful bluffing, can move prices in a direction desired by the spoofer, while causing their counterparties to lose money.<br />Prosecutors argued that Messrs. Bases and Pacilio used spoofing to gain an illicit advantage from 2008 to 2014. The law defining and making spoofing illegal took effect in 2011, after most of the alleged activity had occurred.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Senate moved through a series of amendments to the roughly $1 trillion infrastructure package on Wednesday, with lawmakers anticipating a vote on final passage of the bill this weekend or early next week.<br />Since negotiators finished the 2,702-page bill last weekend, lawmakers have considered amendments offered by a mix of Republicans and Democrats to fine-tune elements of the bill. Republicans have pushed for an open-ended amendment process, while Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) has called for the chamber to move quickly. Democrats are seeking to approve a budget outline for a $3.5 trillion climate and antipoverty package before the chamber departs for its August recess.<br />“The longer it takes to finish this bill, the longer we’ll be here,” Mr. Schumer said.<br />Many of the amendments that have been approved are technical in nature, with one from Sens. Chris Van Hollen (D., Md.) and Mike Rounds (R., S.D.) designed to protect subcontractors on infrastructure projects. The Senate has rejected some amendments offered by Republicans, including one from Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.) that sought to block the federal government from ending efforts to build a barrier along the U.S. border with Mexico.<br />Once lawmakers finish with amendment votes, there might still be several days of procedural limbo before they can vote on the final package. Many Republicans are planning on attending the funeral of the late Sen. Mike Enzi (R., Wyo.) on Friday, likely pushing votes into the weekend.</td>

      <td>Shale companies amassed huge cash piles in the second quarter as oil topped $70 a barrel, but many missed greater sums after hedging contracts curtailed their profits.<br />Leading frackers such as Scott Sheffield of  Pioneer Natural Resources Co.  and Harold Hamm of  Continental Resources Inc.  were on opposite ends of the hedging strategy, with the former’s company missing out on roughly $1.5 billion in upside due to derivatives contracts so far this year, while the latter’s was nearly unhedged and reaping the full reward of surging crude prices.<br />As U.S. oil and gas producers fought to survive last year’s historic oil-price collapse at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, many used hedges to lock in prices for their 2021 production around $50 a barrel, essentially buying insurance against the possibility of having to ride out another crash.<br />Those contracts ended up costing some companies hundreds of millions of dollars this year, at least on paper. In addition to Pioneer,  Devon Energy Corp.  and  Diamondback Energy Inc.  booked a combined $1.9 billion in derivative losses for the first half of 2021.<br />Nonetheless, many of those same shale producers still posted solid second-quarter results overall. Continental collected $289 million in net income on $1.2 billion in revenue, its best quarterly result since 2018. Pioneer’s profit rose to $380 million, the highest in three years, on $3.4 billion in revenue. Diamondback’s $311 million in net income was its best since 2019, while Devon hit a two-year high of $256 million in profit.</td>

      <td>Some of the best episodes of Hal Roach’s beloved comedy series about a gang of mischievous children have now been restored and released on Blu-ray.</td>
      <td>For nearly 100 years, children have grown up with Hal Roach’s “Our Gang” series (aka the “Little Rascals”), little movies that—in the most endearing and funny way imaginable—capture how kids speak, think, understand, and, most important, interact with one another.<br />Now 22 of the remarkable 221 one- and two-reel short subjects have been beautifully restored and released on two Blu-ray discs by ClassicFlix. The string of child-centered films began unrolling in 1922, during the silent era, and ended in 1944. But the best were the 80 Roach-produced talkies released between 1929 and 1938.<br />Millions of us around the world first watched “Our Gang” when we were roughly the same age as the kids on screen, without any awareness that our parents and grandparents enjoyed them generations ago. One reason the films have always seemed surprisingly contemporary is the inclusion of African-American characters. As Leonard Maltin and Richard Bann explain in their definitive guide to the series, “The Little Rascals: The Life and Times of Our Gang,” Roach made a point to include Black children in the gang from the beginning. This was decades before the concept of tokenism, and no one was under pressure to make the cast “diverse.”<br />The Black press of the 1920s and ‘30s celebrated the “Our Gang” shorts as the only product of Hollywood where Black and white people interacted as equals. Even though Roach and his writers included many a stereotypical gag, the Black gang members (“Sunshine Sammy” Morrison, Allen “Farina” Hoskins, Matthew “Stymie” Beard and Billie “Buckwheat” Thomas) were all widely beloved by African-American audiences at the time. Henry Louis Gates lovingly praises the performances of these four exceptional young actor-comics in his introduction to Julia Lee’s excellent 2015 book, “Our Gang: A Racial History of The Little Rascals.”<br />Roach’s films use broad elements of slapstick—clearly the same comedy minds that launched the team of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are at work here. At the same time, the “Our Gang” shorts are remarkably nuanced; there’s an unmistakable sweetness to the child actors themselves, but, at the same time, there’s sarcasm and even a cynical delight in watching some grade-schooler’s harebrained scheme, whether conceived out of good intentions or otherwise, spiral out of control.</td>

      <td><br /><br />Cineastes could be forgiven thinking that the centenary of Satyajit Ray’s birth would bring a cascade of this important Indian filmmaker’s movies to DVD and Blu-ray. But that hasn’t happened, presumably because of rights issues and the degraded physical state of many of his movies. Instead, 16 of his 29 features, along with some other material, are now streaming indefinitely under the banner “Satyajit Ray at 100” on the subscription-based Criterion Channel.<br />Ray (whose surname may be pronounced RAY or, in an attempt to mimic his native Bengali, RYE) came to prominence in the late 1950s, when his first film, the long-gestating “Pather Panchali” (1955), stunned the cinematic world. Its documentary-like focus on the lives of a poor family in rural Bengal heralded a different kind of Indian filmmaking—one drawn to real life rather than to myths and spectacle.<br />The continuation of the young protagonist’s story in two subsequent pictures, “Aparajito” (1956) and “Apur Sansar” (1959), resulted in what’s come to be known as the Apu trilogy. And they, along with “The Music Room” (1958)—in which changing times undo a feckless nobleman—and a string of successes from the early to mid-1960s, cemented Ray’s reputation as a filmmaker of uncommon vision, ranking with such contemporaries as Japan’s Akira Kurosawa, Sweden’s Ingmar Bergman and Italy’s Federico Fellini. But Ray, who died in 1992 at age 70, did more than just write and direct his films; he also composed the music for most of them.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration’s latest eviction moratorium is set to face an immediate and possibly fast-moving legal challenge that could present high hurdles for the White House.<br />A group of property managers and realtors is expected to lodge objections in a Washington federal court to the new moratorium as soon as Wednesday, according to people familiar with their plans. The same plaintiffs, supported by the National Association of Realtors, challenged the previous moratorium, alleging the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lacked legal authority to issue it.<br />The Biden administration itself has acknowledged it might be on tenuous legal footing, and it told members of Congress last week that any new moratorium would need to be enacted by lawmakers. The White House changed course after liberal Democrats pressed the administration to take immediate, unilateral action to prevent people behind on their rent from being forced out of their homes at a time of surging coronavirus cases.<br />On Tuesday, in announcing the new moratorium by the CDC, President Biden said legal experts he had consulted were of mixed opinion but the “bulk of the constitutional scholarship says that it’s not likely to pass constitutional muster.”<br />The ban has protected millions of tenants but created financial hardships for some landlords unable to collect rental income they rely upon for their own livelihoods.</td>

      <td>Joseph Gordon-Levitt talks about his inspiration for the new series he created, “Mr. Corman,” about a depressed Millennial. Susan Sarandon talks about life lists and bucking up her sad son in “Ride the Eagle.” And a teen summer-romance musical featuring actors with disabilities, for those who simply “want to feel joy and be entertained.”<br />Here’s where to stream them all:<br />(Apple TV+)<br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt was born to a pair of loving and supportive parents, had an enviable acting career before he was out of elementary school and made successful transitions to both teen and adult actor. Back in 2015, the year he became a dad, he started counting his blessings and writing down what his life would have looked like if it had all gone differently.<br />The result is “Mr. Corman,” the story of Josh Corman, a sad, single 30-something who had a rough childhood, whose rock ’n’ roll dreams are unfulfilled, who lives paycheck to paycheck, and still brings his anxieties to his mother (Debra Winger). Mr. Gordon-Levitt, who created the series and plays the title character, says that when he imagined what his life could’ve been, it wasn’t all negative. He made the character a fifth-grade teacher, for example, because he says if acting hadn’t worked out, being a teacher wouldn’t have been a concession, but a privilege.</td>

      <td>Perhaps the government disease doctor was referring to constitutional governance.</td>
      <td>Remember in March when Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, decided to share her private hunch at a White House press briefing? Dr. Walensky intoned, “I’m going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom.”<br />Many Americans have learned not to trust her feelings about Covid. But what really should concern the citizenry is that the fearful government disease doctor might have been referring to constitutional liberty.<br />How else can one explain her decision to sign her name to what appears to be an unlawful Tuesday eviction moratorium order? Desperate times call for desperate measures, but Dr. Walensky’s own data show that the times are much less desperate than they used to be. Her CDC website reports that the seven-day average of daily Covid deaths in the U.S. has fallen in half since her March declaration about her fearful feeling, and has tumbled roughly 90% from the peak levels of early January.<br />Did President Joe Biden demand that Dr. Walensky sign an order that they both believe to be unconstitutional? The Journal’s Andrew Ackerman and Siobhan Hughes report:<br />Until the Supreme Court slaps down this latest assault on the property rights of landlords, Dr. Walensky’s order asserts that Americans who violate her directive may be subject to criminal penalties including up to a year in jail. Imprisoning people on such dubious grounds is bound to give Americans a sense of impending doom about due process. And for the record, the alleged emergency is a sham, and not just because daily Covid deaths are fortunately far below their levels of early January.</td>

      <td>From a beachside fitness retreat in Costa Rica to a kayaking trip around Lake Michigan, five super-active vacations to get you back in shape</td>
      <td>MANY OF US re-emerged from Covid lockdown world with two intense urges. The first: a compulsion to be outside—to binge on open space and soothing scenery. The second: to shed some of the Quarantine 15—also cheekily called “the Covid 19”—the unwelcome weight gain accrued by stress-eating and marathon stints of lying motionless on the coach or slumping over a keyboard.<br />To help meet both goals, we’ve assembled five vacation ideas that help straighten your spine, burn calories (at least a modest number) and deliver eyefuls of natural beauty in untrodden settings. Some, like a 500-mile mountain bike trip in Idaho, require well-honed physical stamina. But others, such as a paddling excursion around Wisconsin’s Door Peninsula or a running tour of Morocco, accommodate all skill levels, even habitual coach potatoes. All seem likely to reinvigorate and inspire you far more than an online spin class could possibly do. On your marks, get set, go pack!<br />Last fall, tour operator Escape Adventures completed its five-year-long project—developing the Aquarius Trail Hut System, a 190-mile, six-day hut-to-hut mountain bike route through southern Utah’s Dixie National Forest. Single track and jeep trails traverse spectacularly scenic landscape: high-elevation plateaus, red-rock cliffs and canyons, lakes, forested slopes and sagebrush flats. Pronghorn and elk sightings are common. Cyclists overnight in the five huts scattered along the trail. Cleverly repurposed out of shipping containers, each one sleeps up to six people and comes with showers, solar-powered electricity, evening meals and even cold beer. You don’t need a guide to follow the route, but you can book one for an additional fee. Rather not huff and puff your way for 190 miles? Escape Adventures also rents e-bikes. From $4,489 for up to six cyclists for five nights, aquariustrail.com<br />According to the founders of Rogue Expeditions, there are few better ways to melt the pounds than by running, specifically sprinting uphill, down dirt paths and across sandy terrain. The Texas-based travel company, which organizes run-themed trips around the world, is restarting one of its most popular offerings this fall, a nine-day trip to Morocco, available only for fully vaccinated travelers. The itinerary encompasses the Atlas Mountains, the Sahara, even a surf town on the Atlantic coast. Runners of all levels are welcome and accommodations tend to be small and quaint (guesthouses, rather than big hotels). After the daily runs—you can opt for long or short jaunts—local guides lead cultural tours and you refuel on Moroccan specialties in desert picnics or in small restaurants. Morocco from $2,800 per person guided, roguexpeditions.com<br />Consider the Idaho Hot Springs Loop, developed by the nonprofit Adventure Cycling Association, a self-powered road trip. There are actually two loops—one is 250 miles, the other 500 miles. Both are self-guided and offer cyclists a mix of single-track and dirt roads climbing approximately 37,000 feet through the Sawtooth and Salmon River Mountains—and both feature numerous natural hot-spring pools along the route. A soak in the pools, to say the least, is well earned. If you’re not quite ready to tackle either loop and sleep in the rough nightly, Adventure Cycling offers guided, fully supported inn-to-inn trips around other coveted landscapes, including Vermont’s Green Mountains and Washington’s San Juan Islands. For the Idaho loop, the nonprofit sells self-guided maps for $15.75. Guided trips in other locations, from $599 a person, adventurecycling.org</td>

      <td>The purpose of Chinese firms is to fulfill the goals of the Communist Party.</td>
      <td>Joseph C. Sternberg describes “How China Played American Investors” (Political Economics, July 30) by preventing them from owning most Chinese companies. Instead, investors are allowed to buy into opaque offshore holding companies. It is mechanisms like this that have led many in the West to fall for the Chinese Communist Party’s assertion that China practices “capitalism with Chinese characteristics.” But as Mr. Sternberg notes, real capitalism is more than the presence of private companies; it is a system in which shareholders can control the management of companies.<br />By that definition, China is far from having a capitalist economy, for Chinese state capitalism is a system in which the purpose of firms is to fulfill the goals of the Communist Party. Increasingly, party officials are part of Chinese companies to make sure the company follows the law, a euphemism for following the dictates of the party.<br />Mr. Sternberg is right to mention that U.S. investors not only have few rights, they also have limited insights into the inner workings of firms. In contrast to other firms listed on U.S. exchanges, Chinese firms do not undergo public audits reviewed by U.S. regulators. As such, it’s high time for the Securities and Exchange Commission to ban future listing of Chinese firms on American exchanges and for Congress to require exchanges to delist existing Chinese firms.<br />Robert D.

      <td>Manufacturers must prove to the FDA that they can produce batch after batch safely.</td>
      <td>Your editorial “To Mandate or Not to Mandate Vaccines” (July 28) is correct that the clinical trials that gave rise to the emergency authorizations “were as rigorous as those for full approval,” but that’s far from the whole story.<br />The history of drug and vaccine development illustrates possible pitfalls of post-approval drug manufacturing, some of which have had dire consequences. The most notorious was the 1955 “Cutter incident,” in which more than 200,000 American children received a polio vaccine in which the process of inactivating the live virus was defective. The vaccine, manufactured by Cutter Laboratories, eventually caused 40,000 cases of polio, leaving 200 children with varying degrees of paralysis and killing 10.<br />The  Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are not killed-virus vaccines, so faulty inactivation is not a possibility, but the manufacture is highly complex.  Emergent BioSolutions ,  designated by the U.S. government as the sole domestic manufacturer of the  Johnson & Johnson  and  AstraZeneca  vaccines, had to discard 75 million vaccine doses because of possible contamination. Earlier this year, the Food and Drug Administration recalled certain batches of a commonly prescribed diabetes drug, metformin, because it contained unacceptably high levels of a cancer-causing chemical contaminant.<br />Applications for approval are extraordinarily complex and sometimes contain shortcomings or inconsistencies. The medical and public-health experts who are, with the best of intentions, demanding immediate full approval of the Covid-19 vaccines, have not actually reviewed all the data documenting that the manufacturers can produce batch after batch of vaccine with the necessary purity, potency and sterility.<br />There is also the big-picture issue: If the FDA were to grant full approval to a product that caused a debacle similar to the Cutter incident, or even a problem like the metformin contamination, it would not only injure patients but also provide fodder for antivaccine activists and make the public skeptical of vaccines for years, or even decades. We can’t afford a misstep.</td>

It is found in one word: uniform. All these protests are made by people in uniforms.<br />When one wears the uniform of an organization, whether it be the U.S. military, a police department or an athletic squad, one acts as a representative of a team. As such, the team comes before the members’ desires relative to anything controversial. All team members wear standard attire and are expected to perform in a uniform manner—by the rules of behavior established by team leaders. The military and police have rules of engagement. Athletic teams must follow the rules of the game.<br />Team members should be expected to behave in a manner that does not bring shame or embarrassment to the team as an organization or to fellow members. The bottom line: Professional sports-team owners, and, in this latest case, the leadership of the U.S. Olympic team, have failed in their leadership duties by condoning disrespectful behavior.<br />Col.

Some are dangling bigger bonuses or other incentives to cajole employees into getting the Covid-19 vaccine. Others have started requiring workers get the shot.<br />In recent days, companies from Arkansas-based  Walmart Inc.  to  Microsoft Corp.  in Seattle have imposed vaccine mandates mostly on white-collar workers returning to offices. Meatpacker Tyson Foods Inc. on Tuesday took a harder line, saying all its workers must get the vaccine by Nov. 1.<br />“We did not take this decision lightly,” Donnie King, Tyson’s chief executive, wrote in a memo to the company’s roughly 120,000 U.S. employees. “We have spent months encouraging our team members to get vaccinated—today, under half of our team members are.”<br />Both strategies come with risks for employers, their workers and their customers, and both could shape the course of the pandemic.</td>

      <td>Rising raw-material prices add to costs across automotive industry, but Detroit peers Ford, Stellantis probably have more ways to mitigate problem</td>
      <td>Inflation in vehicle prices has been very helpful for car makers lately. Now investors are seeing the flip side of the coin.<br />General Motors  reported underwhelming second-quarter results Wednesday. First-half adjusted operating profits came in at $8.5 billion, a postbankruptcy record but at the bottom end of the range it indicated as recently as mid-June. The company raised its guidance for full-year profits, but to below where most analysts’ forecasts now sit. The stock fell about 8% in morning trading.<br />The most disappointing quarterly number was arguably the 10.4% adjusted operating margin in the all-important North America region, down from 12.1% in the first quarter. Vehicles have been sparse on dealer lots due to the microchip shortage, leading to a surge in prices that showed up clearly in GM’s revenues. But higher costs ate away the benefit.<br />One reason was a big charge associated with product recalls, notably $800 million for the Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicle. The company discovered a battery defect in the 2017 to 2019 model years that can cause fires. The unexpected cost highlights one of the less-discussed financial risks associated with the industry’s embrace of fast-evolving EV technology.<br />Another reason for the cost increase was inflation in raw-material prices, notably steel and platinum-group metals. Unlike the recall, which is hopefully a one-time effect, this is a continuing headwind. GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson told analysts that commodity costs would be $1.5 billion to $2 billion higher in the second half than in the first.</td>

      <td>Better safe than sick, and I have a history of respiratory problems.</td>
      <td>I was fully vaccinated six months ago. I walked into a pharmacy last week and got another  Pfizer  shot. I didn’t tell the pharmacist it was my third; she didn’t ask. Since the U.S. has no central database of immunization records, the store had no way to know I’d been vaccinated at a federal facility.<br />My friends and family disapprove. “A one-man study of the effects of three doses?” one said dryly. “That sounds safe.” Another, left-leaning and vaccine-skeptical: “This won’t be the last ‘booster’ shot you’ll ‘need.’ Every couple months you’ll be showing up for the latest injection.”<br />I have a history of lung disease: asthma, swine flu, pneumonia six times, bronchitis more times than I know. In November 2019 I contracted a mysterious illness while on business in Los Angeles. It felt like a vicious flu but I tested negative. X-rays indicated incipient pneumonia; I felt winded after a few steps; my olfactory senses went haywire, with some spicy foods tasting bland and vice-versa. I don’t know if I had the coronavirus—antibody tests were inconclusive—or if I could survive something similar.<br />Israel’s Health Ministry recently announced that after five months a double dose of the Pfizer vaccine remains 91% effective at preventing severe disease but only 39% effective against infection. Israelis over 60 who received their last shot at least five months ago are eligible for a third dose. Germany said it will offer third shots to the elderly and sick starting next month, and White House officials told reporters they will soon advise Americans who are over 65 or immunocompromised to get them. I’m 57. Given my respiratory history, why shouldn’t I get one too?<br />Is there an argument that I did the wrong thing? On Wednesday the World Health Organization called for a moratorium on booster shots so that more doses can go to low-income nations. Earlier the  New York Times  quoted Maureen Kelley of the WHO: “If I make a decision to go get a booster, I think I’m complicit in my government’s or the pharma companies’ decisions,” she said. “I don’t think we can easily separate out the individual decisions from these kind of more policy-level decisions.”</td>

I thought it might make for a moment of self-awareness. It was a little prissy of me to think so.<br />Civilization is a thin veneer, as people used to say when men wore neckties and held the chair for ladies as they sat down to “dine.” Manners tend to be an item of nostalgia now, and whatever veneer may have been there once has long since disappeared.<br />The man who wrote that Mr. Jordan deserved his symbolic stomping happens to be a distinguished Jewish American in his 80s, born a year before Hitler and Chamberlain met in Munich.

In light of progress in both countries on the Covid-19 vaccination front, business groups have pushed Washington and Ottawa to reopen border crossings—to the fully vaccinated, at least at the start.<br />Such a move “would sustain jobs, boost business confidence and allow more families to reunite,” according to a joint statement issued by six U.S. and Canadian business lobbies, among them the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “It would help facilitate a safe and gradual return to a more normal life.”<br />After months of lobbying, Canadian officials said they would begin to ease restrictions in August. The U.S. didn’t reciprocate, and instead extended its land border restrictions with Canada and Mexico for another month.<br />Canada said last month it would allow fully vaccinated U.S. citizens and permanent residents currently living in the U.S. to enter the country for nonessential purposes such as tourism and recreation beginning Aug. 9. Travelers will need to wait at least 14 days after their last vaccine dose, present proof of an approved, negative Covid-19 test taken during 72 hours before their arrival in Canada and must not have any symptoms of the disease.<br />Fully vaccinated Americans also will be permitted to bring unvaccinated children under 12 years of age to Canada, although those children won’t be allowed in group settings like camps or daycare centers.</td>

Soon after, Facebook, which hadn’t given permission for the project, demanded the researchers cease collecting the data.<br />On Tuesday, Facebook disabled the accounts, apps, Facebook pages and platform access associated with the project and its operators.<br />“NYU’s Ad Observatory project studied political ads using unauthorized means to access and collect data from Facebook, in violation of our Terms of Service,” Mike Clark, Facebook’s product management director, said in a statement posted to the company’s website Tuesday. Facebook, he said, moved to stop unauthorized scraping and comply with an agreement the company entered into with the U.S. government to address past privacy missteps.<br />Mr. Clark says the project’s browser extension was programmed to evade Facebook’s detection systems and scrape data including usernames, ads, links to user profiles and “Why am I seeing this ad?” information—some of which isn’t publicly viewable on the site by other users.

Second-quarter results from CVS Health show the pharmacy and insurance giant has excellent vital signs.<br />Second-quarter sales of $72.6 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.42 a share both easily topped analyst expectations. CVS also upped its 2021 profit forecast for the second time this year.<br />Yet the stock fell sharply before recovering in early trading.<br />One reason for Wall Street’s skittishness: A rush of Covid-19 vaccinations helps explain the strong quarter. CVS administered about 17 million shots during the quarter—a pace that is bound to slow over the rest of the year. That resulted in extra customer visits and extra revenue. Comparable sales at the pharmacy counter and at the front of the store each rose about 12% from a year earlier.<br />Those growth rates will slow in the near term, but other, larger parts of the business are set to thrive in the longer term. For instance, the $70 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna back in 2018 looks like a winner. Insurance revenue rose 11% from a year earlier and, while the segment’s operating income fell from pandemic-inflated levels, it was up 12% from the second quarter of 2019 even as demand for healthcare returned to normal levels.</td>

Furthermore, it could deal another blow to Canadian businesses in the travel, tourism and hospitality sectors, where sales plummeted due to the Covid-19 pandemic amid border restrictions in place since March of last year, and which were relying on a partial reopening to help salvage what is left of the summer season.<br />Canada said last month it would reopen its borders to fully-vaccinated U.S. citizens and permanent residents currently living in the U.S. to enter for tourism and recreation purposes, starting Aug. 9.<br />“A strike could dissuade fully vaccinated Americans from making a trip if they are concerned about undue delays,” said Mark Agnew, vice president of policy at Canadian Chamber of Commerce.<br />The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has extended its land-border restrictions with Canada and Mexico through Aug. 21.</td>

Mike Parson announced Tuesday that he made good on his promise to pardon a couple who gained notoriety for pointing guns at social justice demonstrators as they marched past the couple’s home in a luxury St. Louis enclave last year.<br />Mr. Parson, a Republican, on Friday pardoned Mark McCloskey, who pleaded guilty in June to misdemeanor fourth-degree assault and was fined $750, and Patricia McCloskey, who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor harassment and was fined $2,000.<br />“Mark McCloskey has publicly stated that if he were involved in the same situation, he would have the exact same conduct,” the McCloskeys’ lawyer Joel Schwartz said Tuesday. “He believes that the pardon vindicates that conduct.”<br />The McCloskeys, both lawyers in their 60s, said they felt threatened by the protesters, who were passing their home in June 2020 on their way to demonstrate in front of the mayor’s house nearby in one of hundreds of similar demonstrations around the country after George Floyd’s death. The couple also said the group was trespassing on a private street.<br />Mark McCloskey emerged from his home with an AR-15-style rifle, and Patricia McCloskey waved a semiautomatic pistol, according to the indictment. Photos and cellphone video captured the confrontation, which drew widespread attention and made the couple heroes to some and villains to others. No shots were fired, and no one was hurt.</td>

      <td>The number of bankruptcy filings in the U.S. has fallen to a level not seen since 1985, thanks to government interventions that kept people afloat during the Covid-19 pandemic and allowed companies to raise cash through debt.<br />In a year marked by lockdowns and periods of high unemployment, 462,309 individuals and companies filed for bankruptcy in the year ended June 30, down 32% from the previous year, according to data compiled by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. That was the lowest tally for a 12-month period since 1985, the administrative office said.<br />Personal bankruptcy filings fell 33% to about 444,000, while business filings declined 17% to about 22,500.<br />The pace of bankruptcy filings has defied predictions early in the pandemic by economists and experts who had expected an avalanche of bankruptcy filings by both households and businesses. The numbers point to government stimulus and moratoria on home foreclosures and evictions keeping a lid on personal bankruptcies, economists say.<br />Corporate defaults were also more muted than many expected, thanks in large part to Federal Reserve interventions that made it easier for companies including  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.  and  Boeing Co.  to raise lots of cash through debt. Following a spike in bankruptcies the spring of 2020 that swept up J.C. Penney & Co. and  Hertz Global Holdings Inc.,  commercial bankruptcies had quieted down by the second half of last year.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Lawyers for former President Donald Trump asked a federal judge to block the release of his tax returns to Congress, saying Democratic lawmakers have no legitimate purpose in seeking them and are trying to score political points by embarrassing Mr. Trump.<br />The Wednesday filing came after the Justice Department directed Treasury officials to turn over the documents to a House panel that has sought them since 2019, saying the panel had invoked sufficient reasons for the request.<br />“The record overwhelmingly reveals that the purpose of the requests...is to expose the private tax information of one individual—President Trump—for political gain,” the lawyers wrote. “They were made to retaliate against President Trump because of his policy positions, his political beliefs, and his protected speech, including the positions he took during the 2016 and 2020 campaigns.”<br />The filing to block the returns’ release is the latest step in a legal battle that began when the House Ways and Means Committee sought six years of Mr. Trump’s tax returns and audit records from the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Trump broke with four decades of tradition among presidents and major-party presidential candidates by not voluntarily releasing them.<br />The committee’s chairman, Rep. Richard Neal (D., Mass.), argued the tax returns were needed to examine how well the IRS was auditing the president who oversees the agency.</td>

      <td>Significant fiscal stimulus this year is speeding the economy’s recovery so that the Federal Reserve is able to consider lifting interest rates from near zero by early 2023, said a top central bank official in a speech Wednesday.<br />Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said he expects that, under his current projections for inflation and employment, “commencing policy normalization in 2023 would…be entirely consistent with our new flexible average inflation targeting framework.”<br />Even though Mr. Clarida isn’t likely to be at the Fed at that time—his term on the board expires at the end of January—his comments are notable because his views are likely shared by a number of other Fed officials and because of his role in shaping the central bank’s current policy guidance.<br />Mr. Clarida was a leading architect of the Fed’s new policy framework unveiled one year ago by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. That framework calls for the central bank to seek periods of inflation moderately above its 2% goal to make up for past misses of the target.<br />The Fed’s framework wasn’t designed for an environment like the current one, where prices are surging due to bottlenecks and supply shortages associated with reopening the economy from the Covid-19 pandemic. That has complicated the Fed’s task of not only forecasting inflation but also of clarifying how it plans to react to incoming data about economic growth, unemployment and inflation.</td>

Tuesday said it would sell Tropicana and other juice brands to private-equity firm PAI Partners.

Last year,  Coca-Cola Co.  discontinued a slew of brands including Tab diet soda, Zico coconut water and Odwalla fruit juices and smoothies.<br />The moves signal at least a partial retreat from the industry’s primary strategy of late. For years companies have multiplied their offerings, expanding from soda into coconut water, smoothies, fermented tea, dairy alternatives and other niche but promising territory.<br />Now, the industry is focusing around a smaller set of categories, including energy drinks, coffee and traditional carbonated soft drinks, said Howard Telford, head of soft drinks at Euromonitor International.<br />The latest shift, like the prior strategy of expansion, reflects an industry trying to satisfy rapidly shifting consumer tastes. Fruit juice and sugary soda consumption has fallen as people have lowered their sugar intake, in favor of alternatives such as diet soda, flavored seltzer and bottled water. Meanwhile, demand is increasing for functional beverages—drinks that help people stay awake or concentrate, for example, or offer a health benefit, like an antioxidant. As a result, coffee and energy drinks are on the rise.</td>

Andrew Cuomo as former supporters called for his removal after a report detailed numerous instances of sexual harassment by the governor.<br />The Assembly’s judiciary committee, which is conducting the impeachment inquiry, plans to meet Monday and combine the report with evidence it has already collected, members said. The chamber’s Democratic lawmakers convened remotely Tuesday after the release of the 165-page report by state Attorney General Letitia James, Assembly members said.<br />Lawmakers said there was a consensus during a three-hour conversation that Mr. Cuomo was no longer fit to stay in office. Several legislators who had previously stopped short of calling for the governor to step down did so in public Tuesday, including Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, a Democrat from the Bronx.<br />“It is abundantly clear to me that the governor has lost the confidence of the Assembly Democratic majority and that he can no longer remain in office,” Mr. Heastie, who controls legislative activity in the Assembly, said in a statement. He said the impeachment inquiry would conclude as quickly as possible.<br />A Marist Poll released Wednesday found 59% of New Yorkers surveyed after the release of Ms. James’s report believed Mr. Cuomo should resign from office, and the same percentage of voters said he should be impeached if he didn’t step down on his own.</td>

      <td>At the Tokyo Olympics’ opening ceremony, American athletes’ preppy uniforms triggered a backlash, but neck bandannas—like the one Cary Grant wore in ‘To Catch a Thief’—arguably redeemed them</td>
      <td>THE FANS WERE in revolt. Many American viewers of the Olympic opening ceremony proceedings in Tokyo last month were not thrilled by the U.S. team’s exceedingly prepped-out uniforms. Created by the designers at Ralph Lauren, they featured a traddy blue blazer, a nautical striped crew neck and an American flag scarf tied preciously around the athletes’ necks. Some viewers took to  Twitter  to voice their disappointment, comparing the team to “bullies from a John Hughes movie” and “fraternity bros vacationing in Montauk.”<br />I’m not here to defend these uniforms: As a total package, they really did make the athletes look like a caricature of the word “prep.” But the uniform isn’t without merit. Take that red-white-and-blue scarf, which sprinkled a much-needed dash of color into otherwise subdued outfits. (I’d also imagine the bandannas helped soak up the sweat Tokyo’s relentless humidity induced.) It’s not a stretch to say that, paired with the blue striped shirts, these scarves recalled the ever-rakish Cary Grant’s look in “To Catch a Thief.”<br />Still, this styling trick is not universally beloved. Some athletes indolently draped their bandannas around their necks or didn’t wear them at all—perhaps they found a choker-like neckerchief too affected for their tastes. Recently, when Izick Espinoza, 26, a Navy first class petty officer based in San Diego, wore a similarly knotted bandanna to a family gathering, his aunt teasingly asked, “Are you missing a baguette?” He might have looked a bit like a French baker, but Mr. Espinoza—like a surprising number of young people—is all in on neckerchiefs, pairing them regularly with simple tees and shorts. The bandanna “just ties everything together,” he said, pun unintended.<br />Other proponents find that a bandanna’s nip of color economically enlivens a sleepy outfit. While working from home this past year in casual white T-shirts, Zach DeLuca, 37, a copywriter in Fremont, Calif., began tying a blue bandanna around his neck, just to add a “little something extra” to his dressed-down attire. More recently, he knotted a bandanna on with a dark-green seersucker suit and a Westernish denim shirt to attend a dinner party. The bandanna “dressed down the suit, which was perfect for the occasion,” he said. And unlike the Olympic team’s uniforms, he added, his outfit earned high marks all around.<br />The Wall Street Journal is not compensated by retailers listed in its articles as outlets for products.

To keep the lights on and homes heated, New Zealand burned more thermal coal, despite its contribution to air pollution. Some industrial users mothballed plants or curbed production to ease stress on the system.<br />New Zealand gets more than half of its electricity from hydropower, an energy source that has grown in popularity around the world in recent years as countries look to phase out fossil fuels, especially coal.<br />Hydropower accounts for around 16% of the global electricity mix, and more than half of power production in countries including Canada, Brazil and Norway, according to Our World in Data, a nonprofit research project at the University of Oxford.

      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. government is at risk of wasting about 100,000 employment-based green cards this year as the federal agency in charge of their issuance faces historic application backlogs related to the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The situation complicates what has already been a yearslong wait for many of the 1.2 million immigrants—most of them Indians working in the tech sector—who have been waiting in line to become permanent residents in the U.S. and are watching a prime opportunity to win a green card slip away.<br />U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency primarily in charge of legal immigration, started off its fiscal year in October 2020 with 120,000 more green cards than the 140,000 it typically hands out, a prospect that promised to put a meaningful dent in the yearslong backlog.<br />But with less than two months left in the fiscal year, it is far from reaching that goal. Recent data on precisely how many employment-based green cards have been processed aren’t available, but a State Department official, Charlie Oppenheim, said in a July question-and-answer forum on YouTube that he estimated the government would end September with about 100,000 green-card numbers still on the table. Any green cards that aren’t rewarded by the end of September will expire.<br />USCIS, which has been plagued with money problems and reduced processing capacity since the start of the pandemic, has been approving green cards at a slower rate than normal. The average green-card application is taking about 10.5 months to complete, up two months from last year, according to government data. In some extreme cases, green-card applications have been sitting for up to five years, the data show.</td>

      <td>Hundreds had been invited to outdoor event in Martha’s Vineyard, drawing GOP criticism amid surging cases</td>
      <td>Former President Barack Obama is scaling back his planned 60th birthday party this weekend at his Martha’s Vineyard vacation home as the nation confronts rising Covid-19 cases and in the wake of criticism from conservatives.<br />The Democrat, whose birthday is Wednesday, had invited hundreds of guests to an outdoor party that was expected to attract some of the nation’s top celebrities. The plans triggered charges of hypocrisy among conservatives, who suggested such actions by a Republican would prompt charges of recklessness from Democrats.<br />“Due to the new spread of the Delta variant over the past week, the president and Mrs. Obama have decided to significantly scale back the event to include only family and close friends,” Hannah Hankins, a spokeswoman for the former president, said in a statement Wednesday morning. “He’s appreciative of others sending their birthday wishes from afar and looks forward to seeing people soon.”<br />Planners had said the larger gathering would have followed all local, state and federal health protocols, including a testing regime managed by a public-health professional. Preparations had started months ago before a surge triggered by the Delta variant and when the pandemic seemed to be waning in the U.S. and as people began to embrace more normalcy.<br />Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, stressed that the event would be held outdoors when asked Monday about the medical considerations and whether ordinary Americans should hold such large parties.</td>

      <td>Even as Beijing unleashes a regulatory assault against tech companies, it continues to shower subsidies and protection on manufacturers</td>
      <td>To Western investors, China’s regulatory crackdown on superstar companies such as  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. ,  Tencent Holdings Ltd.  and  Didi Global Inc.  must seem suicidal. How better to undercut growth than to kneecap some of the world’s most successful technology companies?<br />President Xi Jinping would beg to differ. In his estimation, technology comes in two varieties: nice to have, and need to have. Social media, e-commerce and other consumer internet companies are nice to have, but in his view national greatness doesn’t depend on having the world’s finest group chats or ride-sharing.<br />By contrast, Mr. Xi thinks the country needs to have state-of-the-art semiconductors, electric-car batteries, commercial aircraft and telecommunications equipment to retain China’s manufacturing prowess, avoid deindustrialization and achieve autonomy from foreign suppliers. So even as the Chinese Communist Party unleashes a multifront regulatory assault against consumer internet companies, it continues to shower subsidies, protection and “buy-Chinese” mandates on manufacturers.<br />Mr. Xi described these differential priorities in a speech published by the party journal Qiushi last year. He acknowledged the online economy was flourishing, and said China “must accelerate construction of the digital economy, digital society and digital government,” according to a translation by Georgetown University-affiliated researchers. “At the same time, it must be recognized that the real economy is the foundation, and the various manufacturing industries cannot be abandoned.”<br />Historically, as most countries develop, manufacturing displaces agriculture and then services displace manufacturing. In recent decades manufacturing’s share of gross domestic product in most-advanced economies has declined, especially in the U.S. and Britain, which have seen swaths of factory employment migrate overseas, especially to China.</td>

      <td>Healthcare company says it will raise minimum wage to $15 an hour starting next year</td>
      <td>CVS Health Corp.  posted higher revenue in the latest quarter, helped by the nearly 17 million Covid-19 vaccines it administered between April and June, as it moved to raise its minimum wage for workers to $15 an hour starting next year.<br />With a lift from the vaccinations and from the more than six million Covid-19 tests CVS conducted, same-store sales grew by 12.3% from last year’s spring quarter, when the earlier stages of the pandemic were keeping shoppers at home. CVS’s total revenue, which also includes its health-insurance and pharmacy-services businesses, grew by 11% year over year to $72.62 billion, the company said Wednesday.<br />Joining other retailers that have laid out similar plans, CVS also said it would raise its minimum wage for hourly workers to $15 an hour by July 2022. About two-thirds of CVS’s hourly staff already earn that much, the company said, adding that the increase to the company’s wage floor would help workers and their families.  Walmart Inc.  and  Amazon.com Inc.  are among the other large employers of retail workers that have pledged $15 minimum wages in recent years.<br />Revenue rose 11% in CVS’s health-insurance business in the quarter, but operating income declined significantly for that segment as the company had to pay out more in claims for patients who were returning to their doctors after deferring care earlier in the pandemic. The medical-benefit ratio—the proportion of premiums paid out in claims—rose to 84%, from 70% a year earlier.<br />Overall, CVS posted earnings of $2.10 a share, or $2.42 on an adjusted basis after stripping out one-time items. Analysts polled by FactSet had been forecasting an adjusted profit of $2.07 a share.</td>

The figure for the most recent period marked the firm’s highest distributable earnings since 2013, as it sold off more assets from its eighth flagship private-equity fund.<br />Apollo said it would pay a dividend of 50 cents a share, compared with 49 cents in the second quarter of 2020. In March, the firm announced a deal to buy the 65% of insurance affiliate  Athene Holding Ltd.  that it doesn’t already own. Apollo plans to pay an annual dividend of $1.60 a share following the closure of that deal, expected in January 2022.</td>

As part of the merger, X-Mode will be rebranded as Outlogic and its chief executive, Joshua Anton, will join Digital Envoy as chief strategy officer. The purchase price and other terms of the acquisition aren’t being disclosed. X-Mode was based in the suburbs of Washington but abandoned its office space during the pandemic and went fully remote.<br />Acquiring X-Mode “allows us to further enhance our offerings related to cybersecurity, AI, fraud and rights management,” said Digital Envoy CEO Jerrod Stoller. “It also allows us to innovate in the space by looking at new solutions leveraging both data sets. And it also brings new clients and new markets.”<br />Digital Envoy specializes in collecting and providing to its customers data on internet users based on the IP address assigned to them by their internet service provider or cellphone carrier. Such data, which can include approximate geolocation, is useful in fraud detection, cybersecurity, advertising and other commercial applications.<br />X-Mode had its genesis on the University of Virginia campus in 2013, when as an undergraduate Mr. Anton created an app to prevent users from drunk dialing. Mr. Anton realized the location data being gathered by that app was a valuable product and pivoted toward becoming a location-data company—partnering with other app publishers to collect the precise location of smartphones and provide them to commercial customers in advertising, real estate and other industries.</td>

Are we entering a stage of the cycle where earnings are still reasonably robust, but the recovery is difficult to sustain?”<br />In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged up to 1.175% from 1.174% on Tuesday.</td>

      <td>Second-quarter results show strong business, but fallout from gender-bias lawsuit remains unclear</td>
      <td>Activision Blizzard  probably wishes right now that real life had a reset button.<br />The videogame publisher has been under fire since the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing sued the company two weeks ago, alleging a wide pattern of gender discrimination at the company’s Blizzard Entertainment unit. Tuesday brought another bit of unwelcome news, in the form of a strong hint that China’s ruling Communist Party might be considering a crackdown on videogames, which an official newspaper likened to “opium for the mind.”<br />The combination of news has cost Activision about 13% of its market value, though the shares showed some recovery after hours on Tuesday following the company’s second-quarter results. The report—for the period that ended before California’s lawsuit was filed—showed both a strong business and one readjusting after a huge boom in gameplay last year during the early days of the pandemic. Net bookings of $1.9 billion beat Wall Street’s targets but still declined nearly 8% from the same period last year. The company’s total monthly active user count declined nearly 5% from the same period last year, when usage boomed a record 31%.<br />Less clear from the results is how the scandal of the recent lawsuit could impact the company’s actual business. The complaint filed July 20 accuses the company of running a hostile working environment for women, with allegations of unequal pay and promotion practices listed alongside disturbing instances of harassment. Activision’s initial strident denial of the charges—which included a politically tinged dig at its home state—only made matters worse. Employees staged a walkout last week even after Chief Executive Bobby Kotick publicly apologized for the company’s initial response and promised several reforms.<br />Given that summer is crunchtime for big fall releases, such as the next “Call of Duty,” the timing for such a work stoppage isn’t great. Analysts quizzed Activision executives about the potential for any delays during the company’s conference call on Tuesday, but no such details were given. Mr. Kotick and other executives reiterated the company’s commitment to changes, which included a change in leadership at Blizzard announced earlier in the day.</td>

Businesses are already stuffed with cash, and supply-chain issues and labor shortages have crimped their ability to spend it. But bankers say the activity in recent months is evidence that businesses are planning to turn on the spending spigot. That could help the economy shoot higher.<br />JPMorgan Chase  & Co. and  Bank of America Corp. , the two biggest banks in the U.S., together had nearly $1 trillion in unused corporate credit at the end of June. That is up 20% from a year ago and a quarterly record at both banks.<br />“This virtuous circle of hiring workers and meeting customer spending will help drive the economy, and hopefully will result in more line usage on our loans,” Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan told analysts last month.</td>

It said he grabbed the breast of an executive assistant; caressed the neck, back and belly of a state trooper; squeezed the butt of another employee; inappropriately touched two other women, and over the years, made a habit of hugging and kissing staff members to their discomfort. The report said Mr. Cuomo harassed with his words too, showing an overweening curiosity about their intimate lives, and in one case aboard the governor’s plane, asking an economic adviser to play strip poker.</td>

Lyft’s  shares were slightly higher in after-hours trading.<br />Lyft President John Zimmer cautioned that it was tough to predict the future with the highly transmissible Delta variant boosting Covid-19 cases in the U.S., but said he was optimistic that the company wouldn’t slip back from its profit milestone. Executives said Tuesday on a call with analysts that they expect the company to be profitable by the adjusted measure on a full-year basis in 2021.<br />Rival  Uber Technologies Inc.,  which has a larger global footprint and a capital-intensive food-delivery business, expects to be profitable by the same measure by the fourth quarter. Uber and Lyft have yet to turn a net profit on the strength of their operations and haven’t projected when they might. One-time gains have lifted both companies’ fortunes; Uber posted a net profit in 2018 on the back of a roughly $5 billion gain from certain investments and divestitures.<br />Startups have long pointed to an adjusted metric to signal progress toward to future profits. These adjustments entail stripping out expenses such as asset write-downs that executives and many investors consider to be outside a company’s fundamental operations.</td>

      <td>Latest results show it could pay to be the little guy in the ride-hailing industry, but Covid-19 business challenges remain</td>
      <td>Lyft  wants to prove it can be the Simone Biles of technology—small but mighty.<br />The ride-hailing company said Tuesday that it has achieved profitability, at least on the basis of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. It has done so a quarter earlier than it had most recently forecast and intends to maintain that state, expecting it will now be profitable for the full year on that basis. Lyft’s stock rose in after-hours trading immediately after the report.<br />Sales of $765 million rose 125% year-to-year, benefiting from an easy comparison but coming in 9% above Wall Street’s estimate. Adjusted Ebitda of nearly $24 million was significantly better than the loss of $40 million the company had forecast at the midpoint of its guidance and better than the loss of $44 million analysts were expecting.<br />In some ways, the bumpy nature of the pandemic aided Lyft during the quarter. Active riders increased 27% sequentially to 17.1 million, above analysts’ forecast of 15.5 million, suggesting consumer demand is returning to ride-hailing more quickly than expected as vaccination rates tick up. But at the same time, revenue per ride increased 7% quarter-to-quarter, reflecting consumers’ tolerance for high prices—something that could persist as the Covid-19 Delta variant spreads. The higher prices are in part a consequence of driver shortages.<br />All eyes will now turn to  Uber Technologies ,  which will release its own second-quarter earnings Wednesday after the market closes. In May, Uber said it was on track to reach adjusted Ebitda profitability in the second half of this year. Wall Street is forecasting the company to post hundreds of millions of dollars in losses in the second quarter on an adjusted Ebitda basis, finally turning profitable in the fourth quarter.</td>

      <td>Tenants and landlords have to work it out, and better now than later.</td>
      <td>As Democrats push to renew the nationwide ban on evictions that expired Saturday, they’re squabbling—er, screaming—over who’s failing the party’s progressive base. Speaker Nancy Pelosi puts the onus on President Biden, urging him to act unilaterally. The White House says it lacks legal authority, as the Supreme Court recently made clear.<br />Mr. Biden is correct: The public-health powers of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention do not extend to an interminable blanket prohibition of evictions across the entire nation. Any ban also may be an unconstitutional “taking” of property under the Fifth Amendment, though that’s an argument for another day. The point is that for 11 months President Trump and President Biden stretched their authority, but now Mr. Biden must heed the Supreme Court’s warning.<br />What is Mrs. Pelosi’s alternative? Five Justices this summer let the eviction ban stand until it expired. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s caveat was that the policy couldn’t be continued without “clear and specific congressional authorization (via new legislation).” On Tuesday a defiant Mrs. Pelosi lauded the White House’s “intention to identify all available authorities to extend the eviction moratorium.” In other words, Mr. Biden might be bending under progressive pressure to reinstate the ban. This would be strikingly lawless, as the White House has admitted.<br />Little is being said in this debate about economics, but the numbers make it hard to see any case for a blunt national policy. The unemployment rate is 2.5% in Nebraska. It’s 2.7% in Utah, 2.9% in both New Hampshire and South Dakota, and 3% in Idaho. How much more recovered from Covid can those labor markets get? Other places that suffered longer lockdowns are lagging. But if state and local leaders want, they can pass tailored eviction policies, and then they can be accountable for the results.<br />Too often ignored are the costs on the other side of the evictions ledger. Renters are facing hardships, but so are landlords. There are about 48 million rental housing units in the U.S., according to a 2018 federal survey. For 42% of them, day-to-day management of the property was performed by either the owner or an unpaid agent. Another 25% had a paid manager who was still “directly employed” by the owner.</td>

      <td>If Democrats take sexual harassment seriously, they’ll move to impeach.</td>
      <td>We’re about to find out if Democrats believe what they say about having no tolerance for sexual harassment. If they do, then they have little choice other than to move to impeach Andrew Cuomo as Governor of New York.<br />Mr. Cuomo asked Attorney General Letitia James to investigate the many accusations women have made against the Governor, and on Tuesday the outside lawyers the AG appointed issued their 165-page report.<br />The report recounts the facts as related by 11 women who worked for Mr. Cuomo or came to his attention as part of their work in government or private business. A couple of the accounts don’t seem to rise to the level of harassment. But many do, at least by the contemporary standards set and episodically enforced by the political and cultural left.<br />No corporate CEO, or even a junior executive, would survive in the job amid the trail of bullying, groping, leering, unwanted kissing, and suggestive come-ons recorded in the report by six lawyers at two law firms. In one instance, the report says, Mr. Cuomo noticed a female state trooper he fancied at a public event, had her transferred to his personal protective detail though she lacked the necessary minimum tenure, then “sexually harassed her on a number of occasions.”<br />This included caressing her stomach and back, kissing her on the cheek in the presence of another trooper, and on another occasion asking for a kiss. The reasonable conclusion is that Mr. Cuomo used his power as Governor to violate New York State Police rules to transfer a woman he figured he might be able to coax into a sexual relationship. The report concludes that “the Governor engaged in conduct constituting sexual harassment under federal and New York State law.” In other words, he violated the law.</td>

      <td>New York’s mayor will punish you until you get the Covid-19 shot.</td>
      <td>The modern progressive speaks the language of high-minded purpose but always ends with coercion. Witness New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, the uber progressive, who announced Tuesday that New Yorkers will soon need proof of vaccination to do everything from dining out to working out at a gym. He’s proud that New York is the first U.S. city to impose such a mandate.<br />“It’s time for people to see vaccination as literally necessary to living a good and full and healthy life,” he said at his press conference. You gotta love Mr. de Blasio telling you what is necessary for a good and full life. According to the data, roughly 55% of the city’s residents are fully vaccinated, ranging from 46% in the Bronx to 67% for Manhattan.<br />His response is to exclude the unvaccinated from many of the functions of daily life. He doesn’t seem to care that this burden will fall heaviest on the city’s black population, which is only 31% fully vaccinated (versus 71% for Asian Americans, 42% for Hispanics and 46% for whites).<br />But a government mandate should be a last resort, not a first. Private companies are already setting their own standards for workers and customers, giving people a choice and an incentive to get vaccinated. There’s less justification for government coercion now than months ago with the pandemic having subsided and the city’s hospitals no longer facing the threat of being overwhelmed by Covid-19 cases.<br />Mayor de Blasio calls his approach “The Key to NYC Pass.” It might as well be called NYC Lock, because it threatens the livelihoods of many people who prefer not to get vaxxed, and it will mean a loss of business for others who will have to turn away customers. With only a few months left in his administration, the real pass New Yorkers need is one that gets the mayor out of town early and for good.</td>

      <td>Biden’s trade rep is too cautious about a new pact with Pacific allies.</td>
      <td>The Biden Administration says it’s eager to build better relationships with allies abroad, and a good chance to prove it concerns trade in Asia. A comprehensive trade deal such as the old Trans-Pacific Partnership seems to be political dead letter in Washington, alas, but a new opportunity for U.S. leadership is emerging around digital trade.<br />The economic benefits are obvious, especially in Asia. As more commerce goes digital, data regulations and privacy rules are replacing tariffs and quotas as the major barriers to trade. Thriving trade in high-tech goods and services requires certainty over where data should be stored and under what circumstances it can cross borders. Regulation of fields such as artificial intelligence also is set to come to the fore as a trade issue.<br />Willing partners aren’t short of possible templates. The Digital Economy Partnership Agreement among Singapore, New Zealand and Chile serves less as a formal trade agreement than as a voluntary framework for discussions of digital-trade issues. Pacts such as the 2019 U.S.-Japan Digital Trade Agreement, a Singapore-Australia digital deal or the digital chapter of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal offer more formal protections on matters such as tariffs on e-books and the flows of data within global companies.<br />Beyond the economic benefits, new digital trade deals can serve an important strategic and political purpose. Because so many aspects of digital commerce still are so new, governments everywhere are trying to settle on rules of the road. A strong agreement among the U.S. and its allies to establish open digital trade can create a benchmark.<br />This will be especially important concerning China, which is not included in current discussions toward digital trade agreements. For instance, a common feature of recent digital deals is a prohibition on “data localization” requirements—mandates that companies store data related to their business in a country on servers within that country. Authoritarian regimes such as Beijing are keen on data localization because it allows easier political control of the economy and their citizens. A high-quality digital deal is a chance to establish free cross-border flows of data as the international standard.</td>

      <td>The government releases migrants, untested, to live in tight spaces alongside scores of strangers.</td>
      <td>If it’s unfair to lay all blame for the mess on the southern border at the feet of President Biden, his administration certainly deserves the lion’s share.<br />For all the devastation that Covid-19 has heaped on us, the pandemic provided a breather for border patrol. Apprehensions at the Mexican border are a proxy measure of illegal entries, and in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 2020, there were about half as many apprehensions as there were a year earlier.<br />After Mr. Biden took office, the initial rise in border arrests was thought to be no big deal. “What we’re seeing right now is a predictable seasonal shift,” the Washington Post reported confidently in March. “When the numbers drop again in June and July, policymakers may be tempted to claim that their deterrence policies succeeded. But that will just be the usual seasonal drop.”<br />Except that no serious deterrence policies emerged, and the numbers didn’t drop or even level off. They’ve increased every month of the Biden administration, even during the hottest part of the summer, when they normally come down. Customs and Border Protection announced in July that June apprehensions were not only higher than the previous month but significantly above the next-highest June in more than two decades. For the current fiscal year through June, CBP recorded more than 1.1 million apprehensions. The last time it reached even a million was 2006.<br />Don’t worry, it gets worse. As left-wing Pecksniffs like to remind us, the pandemic ain’t over, the Delta variant is spreading, and too few people are vaccinated. I don’t doubt that White House officials believe this and want to convey their concerns to as many vaccination-averse Americans as possible, but you’d never know it from their unserious approach to border enforcement. And Fox News isn’t the only media outlet that’s noticed.</td>

      <td>The American Rescue Plan boosted the economy during the pandemic. But it didn’t go far enough.</td>
      <td>The good news is that the American Rescue Plan Act, enacted in March, has been effective. At a time of unprecedented health and economic crisis caused by the pandemic, it did exactly what a democratic government in a civilized society is supposed to do: respond to the needs of people in despair.<br />The act provided much-needed direct payments to struggling families, protected the unemployed, fed the hungry, prevented evictions, and allowed small businesses to survive. It helped jump-start the economy, which grew in the second quarter at an annualized rate of 6.5%. Perhaps most important, it provided funding for the government to expand the vaccine program and save thousands of lives.<br />The bad news is that the American Rescue Plan didn’t address the long-neglected structural crises that many U.S. families face: Three people own more wealth than the bottom 50%, real wages for workers haven’t increased in almost 50 years, and we are facing the existential threat of climate change.<br />We need structural reforms to improve the lives of U.S. families. If Democrats can’t get Republican support for these reforms, then we have to do it alone through the reconciliation process.<br />In recent years, Republicans used reconciliation to pass trillions in tax breaks, which primarily benefit the rich and large corporations, and they used it to try to repeal the Affordable Care Act and throw some 32 million people off the healthcare they had. We are going to use it too. But we will use it to support the middle class and struggling families and, in the process, create millions of good-paying jobs.</td>

A poll completed in August 2020 showed that about 20% of the population reported they were very unlikely to take a vaccine even if the evidence suggested it was safe and effective. Another 15% said they were unlikely to take it. Those two categories add up to approximately the percentage of adults yet to get a first dose a year later.<br />Without even knowing there would be a vaccine, more than a third of the population told us they were not planning to accept it.<br />The study was repeated in late December 2020 after highly impressive results from clinical trials led the Food and Drug Administration to give emergency-use authorization for two vaccines. News cycles prior to our December survey were dominated by stories on the potential for vaccines. Still, about 35% said they were unlikely or very unlikely to take the vaccine. The numbers are almost identical to those seen in August when vaccine potential had not received public scrutiny.<br />The Stanford finding that 20% would be very unlikely to take the vaccine is consistent with a variety of other studies. Monthly polls by the Kaiser Family Foundation show the percentage saying they will definitely not take the vaccine or take it only if required has held steady at around 20%.</td>

Voilà. Leverage restored, using her star power to cast a potential shadow over the film’s continuing box office as well as over Disney’s studied self-image.<br />Disney understood as much and answered in kind, albeit oafishly, saying her lawsuit was “especially sad and distressing in its callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.”</td>

      <td>The story of the forgotten American woman at the heart of the German resistance to Hitler, as told by her great-great-niece.</td>
      <td>On Feb. 16, 1943, by special order of Adolf Hitler, Mildred Harnack, a 40-year-old American academic, was executed at Plötzensee prison in Berlin. She had been accused of treason for her role in an underground German resistance group that had put up anti-Nazi posters, distributed seditious leaflets, and helped Jews and dissidents to escape the country.<br />The Nazis called the group the Red Orchestra. Radio transmitters were known by German intelligence as “pianos,” their operators as “pianists.” In 1941, when the Nazis discovered that German “pianists” were sending messages to Communist agents in Moscow, they dubbed the orchestra “Red.”<br />Until now, not much has been known about Harnack. “Her aim was self-erasure,” writes her biographer Rebecca Donner. But as Harnack’s great-great-niece, Ms. Donner, in “All the Frequent Troubles of Our Days,” comes to the story with an advantage. When she was a teenager her grandmother gave her a pile of letters Harnack had written to her family between 1929 and her arrest in 1942. Ms. Donner, an accomplished researcher and reporter, was also able to gain access to documents discovered in an East German archive after the fall of the Berlin Wall. A few years later the Russians opened foreign-intelligence files to historians, and in 1998, under the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, the CIA, FBI and U.S. Army also began to release top-secret records.<br />Harnack was born Mildred Fish in 1902 into an impoverished Milwaukee family. She attended the University of Wisconsin, graduating with a master’s degree in English literature. She met her future husband, Arvid Harnack, a German economist, when he wandered into the wrong lecture hall.<br />In 1929 the Harnacks moved to Germany, where Mildred earned a doctorate at Geissen and later taught American history and literature at the University of Berlin. Her classes were popular but eccentric; sometimes she would sing a folk ballad, “John Brown’s Body” or “Clementine,” and unpack its sad meaning. She lectured about American farmers, factory workers and immigrants, and the writers William Faulkner, John Dos Passos and Theodore Dreiser. She made no secret of her loathing of Hitler. In 1932 she held her first clandestine meeting in her apartment, bringing together political activists of all backgrounds and faiths.</td>

He said the airline had proactively canceled some flights in an effort to reset its operation and was working to refund and rebook customers.<br />The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, a union that represents flight attendants at Spirit and other airlines, said the struggles were compounded by an IT outage Tuesday morning that prevented crew schedulers from being able to access their system for over an hour. Spirit didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on that outage.<br />This summer has been difficult for airlines and passengers.

      <td>Amazon is expected to challenge labor official’s recommendation for a new vote</td>
      <td>A recommendation by a National Labor Relations Board official has opened the door for a redo of a unionization vote at an  Amazon . com Inc. facility in Alabama, renewing the possibility for a breakthrough victory for organized labor.<br />But the union leading the organizing effort is likely to face an arduous process and stiff opposition as it seeks to hold a new election, former labor officials and labor attorneys said. The outcome of any new vote also may not change from when workers voted against organizing in April, they added.<br />The first step toward a potential new vote will start at the NLRB’s regional level, where a director will review the recommendation for a fresh election issued Monday by agency hearing officer Kerstin Meyers.<br />Amazon said it plans to contest Ms. Meyer’s recommendation with the regional director, who could issue a decision in the next several weeks.<br />“Our employees had a chance to be heard during a noisy time when all types of voices were weighing into the national debate,” the company said on Monday. “Their voice should be heard above all else.”</td>

      <td>Simone Biles’ decision to withdraw from certain events highlighted the issue of athletes’ mental health, while the predictable interviews and unyielding threat of Covid-19 leave the rest of the games with much to be desired</td>
      <td>During the Parade of Nations that marked the opening of this year’s 2020 Tokyo Olympics, an NBC commentator acknowledged the entrance of the German team by noting the two Summer Games that their country has hosted: 1936 and 1972. In other words, Hitler and a terrorist massacre. The man on the microphone didn’t seem aware of what he’d just said, but what many probably heard was, “How bad can this year be?”<br />Bad, it turns out. You really have to feel a little sorry for NBC and its snakebit Games. The event is a year late thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic. There’s a troublesome time differential that makes maintaining suspense until prime time usually impossible. There’s an often-depressing onscreen atmosphere—much of fencing, boxing and tennis seem to be taking place in gloomy warehouse spaces, dimly lighted and virtually unoccupied (as have been the stands at most events). The Games were preceded by decisions about pot-smoking runners and women’s swimming caps that raised accusations of both sexism and racism. The director of the opening ceremony was fired because of a Holocaust joke he made in 1998. Scandals abound.<br />The downbeat mood is genuine. NBC has not had it easy. And many of the problems have been beyond its control.<br />However: The most memorable moment of these Olympic Games will be the decision by Simone Biles to withdraw from most events (coming back, she won bronze on balance beam). And that will have ramifications for many TV Olympics to come. The viewing public has been made aware that the pressure on athletes comes from many directions and, rightly or wrongly, the interview process as exercised by NBC will increasingly be seen as not just invasive but destructive.<br />The network, which has been broadcasting the Summer Olympics since 1988 and has the rights through 2032, has always looked to impose additional drama on an event that’s already beyond dramatic, by latching onto the personalities who have the most mainstream appeal and the most sentimental stories. Getting “up close and personal”—a coinage, as it happens, of the ’70s Roone Arledge-era ABC, when that network aired the Olympics—is supposed to humanize the athletes. Better to humanize the interviewers: The segments are invariably cloying, with the on-air talent asking athletes impossible, witless questions of the “how does it feel?” variety. When Ms. Biles made her initial decision to withdraw, what came to mind was her interview earlier with NBC’s Hoda Kotb, who asked (and I paraphrase) what is it like carrying around the burden of being the greatest female gymnast of all time? Ms. Biles was her usual genial self, but you could see how this inanity could wear one down, never mind the combined pressure of competition and media. (See also: Naomi Osaka.)</td>

      <td>A new series on the Science Channel investigates the world’s most historic—and forgotten—shipwrecks, including those that were the result of nuclear testing.</td>
      <td>The 10-part series “Abandoned: Expedition Shipwreck” is like a tour of a haunted house, albeit one with a lot of room. And waves. Beneath the surface of seas, on the floors of oceans and even under the Saint Lawrence River lie secrets, ghost stories and, most important, wrecks. What the series promises is a search for those sunken ships, many of which have been largely lost to history, and the reasons they sank.<br />With that in mind, the first episode might have a viewer feeling like a victim of bait-and-switch. The focus, at least initially, is entirely on the fate of Bikini Atoll and its people, who were evicted in 1946 in preparation for U.S. military-run nuclear tests. Bikini would be rendered unfit for human habitation (though the fish and coral have returned), and the whole episode is portrayed as a vast injustice—never mind the uncertainties of the Cold War, the U.S.-Soviet arms race or that so much was then unknown about nuclear weapons or radioactivity. The Bikinians are described as having been “led to believe” they were performing a public service, but there’s little reason to think anyone was trying to mislead them.<br />When the show stops preaching and gets down to business it’s riveting. The series will, in future weeks, address various mysteries, including the wreck of the Empress of Ireland, one of Canada’s worst maritime disasters, and the World War I era scuttling of dozens of German warships off the Orkney Islands of Scotland. In the lagoon surrounding the Bikini Atoll, however, are the hulks of ships that were sunk for patriotic purpose.<br />Under the direction of Art Trembanis, a professor in the School of Marine Science & Policy at the University of Delaware, the expedition locates the super-dreadnought Nagato, which was the flagship of Japanese Adm. Isoroku Yamamoto when he ordered the attack on Pearl Harbor; the Sakawa, another storied enemy warship, which was turned over to the U.S. and also placed among the flotilla subjected to both midair and underwater atomic-bomb explosions. The scalloped surfaces of the hulls of the ships, the fact that some were driven into the floor of the lagoon, and the virtually skeletal remains of others testify to the awesome power of those 1940s nuclear bombs. Using these Japanese ships as nuke fodder was about payback to a large extent, and that is acknowledged. But included among the craft being “expended” was the aged USS Arkansas, which was crushed by the force of blasts equal to those used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki a little less than a year earlier.<br />“Abandoned” makes dramatic use of period footage, but the most chilling visual elements are those from beneath the surface, surveys of the ships that were tossed about like toys and whose formidable iron hulls were folded like origami. As a kind of Cold War atomic-power sidebar, the episode includes the story of the USS Thresher, which in 1963 sank during deep test dives off the coast of Massachusetts. Revealing exactly how and why it met its fate would be a spoiler, but the submarine was designed for dives of 1,300 feet. Its very scattered remains lie in 8,500 feet of water. The fate of the Thresher’s 129 men is awful to contemplate.</td>

      <td>Shares of popular trading app rose to $46.80 on Tuesday, up from initial-public-offering price of $38</td>
      <td>Shares of  Robinhood Markets Inc.  jumped Tuesday, surging past the company’s initial-public offering price in a reversal from last week’s underwhelming trading debut.<br />The company’s stock, which trades under the ticker symbol HOOD, rose 24% to $46.80 after surging as high as $48.59 earlier in the day. Robinhood, the maker of the popular zero-commission trading platform, made its debut on Nasdaq last week, opening at $38 a share. Its stock tumbled shortly after trading kicked off, falling more than 10% intraday, before settling below $35.<br />In the days since, Robinhood’s stock struggled to surpass its IPO price—until Tuesday.<br />Analysts and traders have been carefully watching Robinhood’s first few days of trading because of the company’s unusual decision to allocate a large chunk of its shares to its own customers. As much as 25% of the IPO shares went to Robinhood customers, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. Typically, individual investors receive well under 10% of IPO shares in such deals, according to brokers.<br />In the end, roughly 301,500 Robinhood customers participated in the IPO, the company said recently. Yet outside the company’s customer base, data from Vanda Research’s VandaTrack show, demand from retail traders was tepid. Excluding IPO shares, individual investors purchased nearly $18.9 million of Robinhood shares on a net basis during the stock’s first day of trading, according to VandaTrack. In comparison, individual investors purchased a net $139.9 million of shares during Uber Technologies Inc.’s first day of trading and nearly $70 million during Didi Global Inc.’s trading debut on a net basis.</td>

      <td>Damning report on governor’s conduct shines light on shifting party power structure, rise of new priorities and difficulty in steering clear of internal warfare</td>
      <td>A damning report on Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s conduct in office explores deeply important questions involving the problems of sexual harassment and toxic workplace environments.<br />But on a more purely political level, the report also shines a light on some broader changes within the Democratic Party: a shifting party power structure, the rise of new priorities and the difficulty in steering clear of internal warfare even when in power—maybe especially when in power.<br />The report by New York Attorney General Letitia James said an independent investigation confirmed previous accusations by current and former state employees that Mr. Cuomo sexually harassed them or acted inappropriately, and that his behavior fostered a hostile environment. Mr. Cuomo steadfastly denied those assertions, and gave no hint he would resign, despite a late-afternoon call from President Biden, as well as calls from most prominent New York Democrats, that he do so.<br />The Cuomo controversy comes as the party is at a kind of inflection point. Issues such as gender and racial equality are taking on a greater prominence on Democrats’ list of priorities, while a younger and more diverse set of rising leaders is demanding a greater voice in adjudicating them. Meantime, even powerful longtime figures are under pressure to adapt to a more progressive agenda.<br />Mr. Cuomo’s predicament punctuates each of those trends. The accusations against him center on sexual harassment, where there is less and less tolerance for questionable behavior. He stands accused by a female, Black attorney general who seems unfazed in challenging a man who has been her party’s ultimate New York power broker and, until just a few months ago, a celebrity widely hailed for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.</td>

The chief cited a continuing investigation for not releasing any additional details about the attack, but also said there was no longer a threat to the Pentagon.<br />“We are not actively looking for another suspect at this time,” Chief Kusse said, adding that officials were still trying to determine a motive.<br />Law-enforcement officials briefed on the investigation identified the suspect as 27-year-old Austin William Lanz.</td>

      <td>Gary Gensler highlights platforms that allow investors to borrow against cryptocurrencies</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Securities and Exchange Commission will regulate cryptocurrency markets to the maximum extent possible using its existing authority, Chairman Gary Gensler said Tuesday, while also calling on Congress to grant the agency more scope and resources to oversee the sector.<br />Calling the asset class rife with “fraud, scams and abuse,” Mr. Gensler signaled the SEC is likely to become more active in policing crypto trading and lending platforms, as well as so-called stablecoins.<br />“We just don’t have enough investor protection in crypto. Frankly, at this time, it’s more like the Wild West,” Mr. Gensler said in prepared remarks to the Aspen Security Forum. “We have taken and will continue to take our authorities as far as they go.”<br />U.S. financial regulators have struggled to get their arms around the fast-growing world of cryptocurrency and related financial technologies. Unlike in the securities and derivatives markets, no single regulator oversees crypto exchanges or brokers. As the market value of the asset class has exploded to more than a trillion dollars, so have scams.<br />Mr. Gensler said large parts of the sector operate outside of regulatory frameworks that seek to protect investors and consumers, reduce crime, promote financial stability and protect national security.</td>
