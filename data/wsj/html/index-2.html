      <td>An appeals court ruling against the Securities and Exchange Commission is a blow to the runaway administrative state.</td>
      <td>That rumble you hear in the distance is federal courts moving to re-establish the proper understanding of the Constitution’s separation of powers. The latest legal bombshell is a decision last week by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals (based in Louisiana) against the Securities and Exchange Commission.<br />The case involves hedge-fund founder George Jarkesy and an investment adviser, and it goes to the heart of whether the Constitution still protects individual liberty. In 2013 the SEC charged the pair with securities fraud for allegedly inflating the value of fund assets. The agency said the higher valuation allowed them to earn higher management fees.</td>

The real lesson is that a ruling party that stands for little but a pale version of the opposition is likely to lose.<br />Australians can be forgiven for thinking little was at stake in this election because not much was. Scott Morrison, the defeated Prime Minister, had surrendered on climate last year by agreeing to the 2050 “net zero” carbon emissions goal of the global left. Labor leader Anthony Albanese, the new PM, campaigned on an end to the “climate wars,” but the Liberal-National Coalition had already conceded the principle. It all but abandoned the issue that had been crucial to its previous two election victories.</td>

Progressives want cheap and abundant green energy that boosts U.S. manufacturing, but they’re discovering they can’t have it all.<br />The Commerce Department in March launched an investigation to determine if solar companies are circumventing antidumping duties on China by diverting production to Southeast Asia.

From debates about an energy embargo against Russia or the prospects of European Union membership for Ukraine, European diplomats are dealing in the art of the diplomatic “maybe.” High-ranking EU representatives are regularly visiting Kyiv and promising President Volodymyr Zelensky immense military, economic and diplomatic aid. These promises will be hard to keep once they collide with the cold realities of European politics and the national interests of EU member states.</td>

      <td>The Fifth Circuit says the agency violates the Constitution by acting as prosecutor, judge and jury.</td>
      <td>The U.S. Constitution’s separation of powers was meant to ensure that government power would never become concentrated in the hands of a few. But since Franklin D. Roosevelt’s threat to “pack the Court” in 1937, the federal judiciary has aided and abetted the rise of an all-powerful administrative state. The separation of powers has since dissolved to a point that would have dismayed the Framers—and should worry all Americans.<br />Now the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has taken what could be a historic step toward restoring the Constitution’s checks and balances, in the case of Jarkesy v. SEC. The Securities and Exchange Commission acts as rulemaker, prosecutor and judge for America’s securities laws. It may have a solid case for fraud against investor George Jarkesy, but the powers and perks the agency has accumulated pose the constitutional problem.</td>

Yet the Food and Drug Administration has been enforcing an effective ban on formula from Europe, the world’s largest producer and exporter.<br />Some of the current shortage of baby formula derives from pandemic-related labor and supply-chain problems, as well as a recall of Abbott Nutrition formula products, which knocked out a large chunk of domestic supply. The other domestic suppliers, such as Bobbie Baby Formula, simply can’t “flip a switch and just make more formula,” as CEO Laura Modi put it.</td>

Mrs. Pelosi, a Catholic, has been at the center of a Democratic push to codify abortion protections in federal law after a draft Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade leaked this month. She has spent decades framing her political career as an expression of her faith, all the while working to expand abortion access in defiance of Catholic doctrine.<br />In a letter to Mrs. Pelosi, Archbishop Cordileone said he had previously discussed with her the church’s teaching on the immorality of abortion. The archbishop said eventually Mrs. Pelosi stopped taking his calls. He felt the time had come to make a decision about the spiritual consequences of Mrs. Pelosi’s sacramental life, both for her sake and for the good of his flock. His friends say he was reluctant to do it.</td>

Wade is overturned with abortion laws in Europe, which were reached by democratic processes. One should remember that it was Vladimir Lenin who was the first to legalize abortion. His goal was to abolish the “bourgeois family.” The U.K., in 1967, legalized abortion under very limited conditions, but the real impetus to expand the availability of abortion came from us with Roe in 1973, not from abroad.<br />Abortion laws in Europe have changed greatly over time. In 1975 France liberalized its treatment of abortion and today has superficial restrictions after 14 weeks of pregnancy. Ireland was the last to legalize it, by referendum in 2018. Poland’s ban was passed after it left the U.S.S.R. and entered the European Union.</td>

The Republican Party “is surprisingly good at building a multi-faith and multi-racial coalition,” Mr. Mounk tweeted. Democrats had best take note.<br />I’m not sure it’s the party that’s building the coalitions and I’m not sure they’re coalitions exactly, but something new is being built, and it involves the widening of the Republican Party in terms of who wants to join and whom its voters will support.

They plan to file a lawsuit to save their businesses.<br />“If you read the law and you read the legislative history behind it, it was crystal clear that what the City Council was really trying to do was stop a farming practice that it considered objectionable,” Ed Phillips, the farmers’ lawyer, says in a phone interview. Making foie gras requires a force-feeding process, which causes liver expansion similar to what wild ducks undergo before migration but on a greater scale. Messrs. Henley and Saravia feed their birds a gradually increasing liquid diet through a 6-inch rubber tube about half an inch wide. The process is lawful, and they contend it is humane and the birds suffer no ill effects.</td>

In one case, I read about a Virginia mother’s push to get her son’s high school to ban a novel about slavery that gave him nightmares. I was struck that such a standard would preclude reading many outstanding literary works. The “Iliad,” “Macbeth,” “The Trial” and “1984” come immediately to mind. If literature can cause nightmares, so can history. “History is a nightmare from which I’m trying to awake,” Stephen Dedalus famously says in James Joyce’s “Ulysses.” “Ulysses” was published in 1922, four years after World War I ended.<br />It’s true that becoming educated means learning about, in the words of Matthew Arnold, “the best which has been thought and said.” It also requires learning about the dark passions that drive human beings. Young children shouldn’t be required to read disturbing literary or historical material, but it is important that older students learn what our world is really like.</td>

He stoked former Sen. David Perdue into challenging Mr. Kemp last year, and then handed him his “complete and total endorsement.” Mr. Perdue, who lost a January 2021 runoff to Democrat Jon Ossoff, has run a straight-up “stop the steal” campaign, saying at a March Trump rally: “Let me be very clear. Very clear. In the state of Georgia, thanks to Brian Kemp, our elections were absolutely stolen. He sold us out.”</td>

      <td>Colleges will no longer be able to raise tuition by the amount of the government subsidy with impunity.</td>
      <td>Regarding Richard Shinder’s op-ed “Student Loan Relief Should Come in Bankruptcy Court” (May 11): I propose the following adjustments: The federal government stops making student loans. Congress amends the bankruptcy laws to allow the discharge of student loans. Thereafter, each college will finance all student loans out of its endowment.<br />This will serve at least two purposes. First, colleges will no longer be able to raise tuition by the amount of the government subsidy with impunity. Second, the ability of a student to discharge a loan should increase the due diligence on the part of a college when determining how much and at what rate to lend to a prospective student. Only when colleges suffer the consequences of their indiscriminate spending, and face the possibility of student default, will some sense of sanity return to the college cost structure.</td>

The actual genius of Locke was that he took the political ideas of the Puritans and repackaged them for broader consumption. He shifted the weight of their arguments from biblical revelation to reason.<br />Freedom of conscience was embedded in Protestantism from the beginning when Martin Luther stood before the Imperial Diet of Worms and said, “Unless I am convinced by Scripture and plain reason—I do not accept the authority of popes and councils, for they have contradicted each other—my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and I will not recant anything, for to go against conscience is neither right nor safe. God help me.” He later followed this up with strong statements against the coercion of belief in state and church. The early magisterial Reformation, however, was not always consistent with its founding principles. It wasn’t until believer’s baptism emerged that liberty of conscience received full expression.</td>

      <td>10-year Treasury yields are on track to fall for seven out of nine trading days</td>
      <td>Stock futures slid, pointing to deeper losses for U.S. markets on growing worries of an economic slowdown.<br />Futures for the S&P 500 fell 1.6%, suggesting the index will open close to bear market territory—market shorthand for a 20% fall from a recent high. The broad market gauge briefly fell into a bear market during the pandemic panic in March 2020 before launching on a two-year rally that peaked on Jan. 3 this year. It tumbled 4% Wednesday, its biggest one-day retreat since June 2020, as fears of a recession dragged down stocks across the board.</td>
