      <td>To adapt what Stalin said of the Pope, how many divisions does the Supreme Court have? That seems to be the implicit slogan of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who on Thursday ignored the High Court’s recent ruling with a proposed rule requiring states to reduce CO2 emissions on highways—that is, banish gas-powered vehicles.<br />In West Virginia v. EPA, the Court ruled that regulatory agencies can’t impose costly new regulations without a clear direction from Congress. The feds had interpreted an obscure corner of the Clean Air Act to impose costly climate rules on power plants.</td>

He now faces a $1 billion breakup fee, as well as extensive litigation with the company. Mr. Musk offered $54.20 a share, but the stock had fallen to $36.81 before Friday’s announcement. It fell to $35.04 in after-hours trading.</td>

This is a welcome development, though Washington is only starting to address the threats the U.S. faces.<br />The Senate Armed Services Committee recently passed a national defense authorization for 2023 that would provide the Pentagon $817 billion, up from the roughly $773 billion the Biden Administration requested, about a $45 billion difference. The House amended its initial draft in committee to add $37 billion to President Biden’s request. These increases are aimed in part at mitigating inflation, which is crushing the Pentagon’s buying power, especially on fuel and housing.</td>

Japan’s former Prime Minister was rarely without this memory pin, worn as a reminder of Japanese citizens kidnapped by North Korea in the 1970s and 1980s and the grieving families they left behind.<br />Abe spent much of his life in politics working to get North Korea to acknowledge the Japanese it had kidnapped and reunite those still living with their families in Japan. He raised the issue as a backbench member of the Diet. He took part in the first Japan-North Korea summit in 2002, when then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi negotiated the return of five Japanese kidnap victims. During his two terms as Prime Minister, he pressed the issue with successive American Presidents, encouraging them to meet with the families of Japanese abductees.</td>

Natural Resources Defense Council, the 1984 ruling that vastly expanded the power of administrative agencies. If so, the beginning of the end will have come on the closing day of this year’s term, when the high court decided West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency.<br />In Chevron, the justices held that when Congress enacts an “ambiguous” statute, courts are obliged to defer to any “reasonable” interpretation offered by an executive-branch agency. The Chevron doctrine assumes that agency personnel have expertise that judges lack and that agencies are more democratic than courts because the former answer to the president. Chevron deference allowed the EPA to set national carbon-dioxide standards, the Transportation Department to prescribe automobile safety features and numerous other agencies and departments to regulate virtually every aspect of American life.</td>

In New York recently my family was eating at a fast-food restaurant when an old woman in a wheelchair came in and wheeled herself to the table where we were sitting. We moved to another table because she talked incoherently, smelled terrible and wasn’t fully dressed. Other patrons scattered as she kept moving around the restaurant. Twice she wheeled herself up to the ordering counter. I saw the staff give her a drink, which I don’t think she paid for. I don’t know this person, but I do know that she needs adult supervision—i.e., a caregiver.<br />How many elderly Americans need a caregiver because of mental or physical infirmity (or both)? According to the American Association of Retired Persons, 70% of people over 65 will need long-term services and support, but many won’t get it because there aren’t enough caregivers. This shortage, the AARP says, is going to get worse in the next decade. There will be a national shortage of 151,000 caregivers by 2030.</td>

But widespread fears that a sharp devaluation of the peso is coming, along with higher inflation, suggest otherwise. The country could be headed for another crackup.<br />The March rescheduling of the IMF debt wasn’t the first time Mr. Guzmán bought more time for the world’s most notorious deadbeat to repay what it has borrowed. In August 2020 he led a restructuring of some $65 billion in sovereign debt held by major bondholders such as Fidelity Management & Research Co., Monarch Alternative Capital LP, VR Capital Group, Greylock Capital Management and Pharo Management LLC.</td>

I clearly recall the dread I felt that the next day would bring even worse news and more tragedy. Living directly outside Washington, I especially regretted bringing my two young girls so close to a potential target area.<br />Yet when my wife and I sat in bed that night with each child, we expressed none of that fear. We told our girls that we had faith in our country, its leaders and its military to stop the “bad men” who had threatened us. And we prayed together, and then again, alone and silently, that what we told them would be true.</td>

States with robust money-follow-the-child programs, such as Florida and Arizona, register achievement gains far exceeding the national average. Florida’s low-income fourth-graders went from 12% proficient in reading in 1998 to a nation-leading 28% proficient in 2019. That 133% improvement is more than double the national average, while here in Kansas proficiency declined.<br />Toni Jennings, a retired teacher and former lieutenant governor of Florida, says, “The more competition we had in education, the better off we became. So, I for one believe that competition is good. But you will hear those who say, ‘Oh no, you’re making the public schools compete with others.’ Well, those children are going to have to go out and compete with others in the workaday world.”</td>

I was hesitant because I figured he was planning to yell at me for a column I had recently written: “Stocks Weren’t Made for Social Climbing.” I wrote, “Profits are the best measure of a business’s value to consumers—and to society.” Instead, he was quite pleasant, though while I ate, he complained that most other environmental, social and governance funds weren’t all that socially responsible compared with his—“not ESG enough.” I asked him what was in his portfolio, expecting  Tesla  or some oat-milk company. He answered, “ General Motors . ” OK then.<br />These days ESG is big business, with $2.77 trillion in “global sustainable fund assets.” The average expense ratio is 0.41%. And sure enough, apparently some funds aren’t ESG enough. Police in May raided the European offices of  Deutsche Bank ’s  DWS unit in an investigation of “greenwashing”—saying its investments were more sustainable than they were. The authorities claim, “We’ve found evidence that could support allegations of prospectus fraud.” In June the Securities and Exchange Commission announced an investigation into  Goldman Sachs  for claiming some of its funds were sustainable and ESG when they really weren’t. This is a fight over branding. What has the investment world come to?</td>

But the lone responding officer shot and killed Haarsma, who was unarmed, as he attacked her during an attempted arrest over a minor offense.

Roughly 1 in 5 involved a police response to someone showing signs of mental illness. It doesn’t have to be this way.</td>

Late last month he said, “We now understand better how little we understand about inflation.” By analyzing the money supply during the global financial crisis, which started in 2008, and our current inflation, we can see why the U.S. economy and inflation behaved differently in those two periods. It’s all about money, not fiscal policy, supply chains or energy prices.<br />Money dominates. Broad money growth drives nominal spending. In normal times most money is created by commercial banks. When a bank makes a loan, it credits the borrower’s deposit account. The loan does not come from the bank drawing down on its reserves at the Fed. Banks can also create money by purchasing securities, again crediting the deposit account of the issuer or seller of the securities. Provided they can meet all capital, liquidity and leverage requirements, banks create loans out of thin air.</td>

The consumer-price index rose 8.6% in May compared with a year earlier. Household spending on prescription drugs rose only 1.9% over the same period. In the last quarter of 2021, net prices for medicines—after subtracting rebates, discounts and fees—dropped 0.7%, the largest quarterly decline in 15 years. If other products such as eggs (up 32%), gasoline (up 49%) and used cars (up 16%) had behaved like drugs, inflation would be completely under control.</td>

      <td>Owners fear recession but are still adding workers.</td>
      <td>The owners of small U.S. firms went on a hiring binge last month and continue to raise compensation to attract and retain scarce workers. That’s according to the latest monthly employment survey from the National Federation of Independent Business, due out later today.<br />What makes this strong desire to hire especially odd is that it is occurring  even as the owners of small firms are more pessimistic about future business conditions than they’ve been in at least 48 years, according to NFIB. Nobody knows how long this situation in which operators are fearful about the future but eagerly expanding in the present will last. For now American workers still enjoy a historically tight labor market.</td>

      <td>China’s government dismissed a joint U.S.-U.K. warning to businesses that Beijing seeks to steal their corporate secrets, alleging instead that Washington represents the biggest threat to world peace.<br />Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Thursday that the U.S.-U.K. statements have no factual basis and expose an “entrenched Cold War zero-sum mentality and ideological prejudice.” He called the U.S. the most warlike nation in history and “the biggest threat to world peace and development,” while saying the U.K. spy services are trying to “project their own disgraceful acts onto China through these false, sensational reports” to stoke antagonism and confrontation.</td>

      <td>A Dior logo? At Sun Valley? It’s a backroom merger few saw coming.<br />On Tuesday, IAC Chairman Barry Diller surfaced at Allen & Co.’s annual conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, wearing a jaunty floral Dior shirt with a “Weekend at Bernie’s” vibe. The shirt, a version of which is currently selling on  The RealReal  for $1,495, bucked the traditional Sun Valley style of mundane business casual.</td>

      <td>Debt forgiveness is a Band-Aid, not a solution.</td>
      <td>Phil Gramm and Mike Solon speak the truth: “Student Loan Forgiveness Is a Political Bribe” (op-ed, June 30). But their analysis doesn’t go far enough. If loans to today’s students are forgiven, tomorrow’s students will have every reason to expect the same break—and woe betide the politician who says no to them. Student-loan forgiveness will create a colossal new entitlement, without Congress having passed a single line of legislation.<br />The real beneficiaries won’t be the students but the colleges and their administrators. They will be told that, in effect, the sky is the limit with regard to what they charge, because Uncle Sam is footing the bill. This will be a huge transfer of taxpayer money to a Democratic Party constituency.</td>
