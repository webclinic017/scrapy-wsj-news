      <td>We’re in a funny place with the Covid pandemic. It feels like it’s ending. Its ability to govern our lives is, certainly. Lockdowns and shutdowns ran out of steam; people have returned to life or are returning. At the same time we know we’re not at the end. We read the headlines—infections flare here, hospitals suddenly overwhelmed there. Covid isn’t leaving, it’s sticking around. The subject of mandates is an ever-changing blur; no one knows exactly what’s officially allowed, and where.<br />Great books will be filled with all we learned and how the pandemic changed us and our society. We’ll grapple with it for decades.</td>

      <td>Program by program, here’s how Democrats disguise the real cost of their entitlement blowout.</td>
      <td>The Congressional Budget Office on Thursday released its “official” cost estimates for the House tax and entitlement bill, but don’t believe it. The CBO gnomes aren’t lying. They’re obliged to score the bill under the rules set by Congress. And Democrats have rigged the budget rules with multiple tricks that disguise the real cost by trillions of dollars.<br />Democrats phase out the biggest programs in the bill while paying for them with 10 years of tax increases. They phase-in other programs and off-load costs to the states. The Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates the House bill would cost nearly $4.6 trillion over 10 years if temporary provisions are made permanent, as most will be.</td>

The episode reveals how inflation is seeping into business decisions and worker demands.<br />Some 10,000 union workers for the farm-equipment giant approved a labor contract Wednesday, ending a strike that began Oct. 14. The contract includes an $8,500 restart bonus, an immediate 10% raise, two 5% raises and two large bonuses through 2026. Total retirement benefits for an average worker will rise by $270,000. Most important as an economic signal, wages will be adjusted each quarter based on inflation.</td>

Two years ago the National Basketball Association apologized when one of its general managers angered China with a tweet about Hong Kong. In sharp contrast, the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) is today standing firm on its demand that an allegation by a star player that she was sexually assaulted by a high-ranking Chinese official “must be investigated fully, fairly, transparently and without censorship.”<br />The WTA call came after Peng Shuai, a championship tennis player, used her account on Weibo to accuse Zhang Gaoli, a former vice premier of China, of forcing her to have sex. She also said the two had a years-long on-off consensual relationship. Within a half hour, her post was taken down.</td>

Green Bay Packers Inc. is organized as a publicly held nonprofit corporation owned by the public, and this week it announced its sixth “stock offering” in the franchise’s history. For a league that prides itself on leveling the playing field through salary caps and reverse-order drafts, the NFL made a glaring error when it adopted a rule allowing only one team to raise capital this way.<br />This mechanism of funding has a long history. The first Packers stock sale occurred in 1923; the most recent, in 2011, helped finance development of a shopping and restaurant complex called Titletown adjacent to Lambeau Field.</td>

The communiqué, published after last week’s Sixth Plenum meeting, made clear that Mr. Xi’s already expansive power will grow. The effects of this will be felt around the world, but few groups stand to suffer as much as Tibetans.<br />The party’s communiqué mentions “national rejuvenation” eight times. The phrase may sound harmless, if a bit nationalistic. Yet a key component of national rejuvenation is unification, which in Beijing’s view requires the destruction of minority cultures. Tibetans—who have been struggling against the party’s attempts to erase their identity for more than 60 years—understand the danger of “national rejuvenation” all too well.</td>

Millions of readers devoured their copies of Life, Look, the Saturday Evening Post, Collier’s, the New Yorker, Reader’s Digest, Time, Newsweek, Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, Ladies’ Home Journal and more. They were rewarded with provocative stories, stunning photographs, illustrations by popular artists like Norman Rockwell, and beguiling ads for sleek new cars and other prizes of the booming consumer economy.<br />That world has all but disappeared.

It’s a shame because the slick magazines perfected forms of popular journalism, short fiction and fashion coverage that informed and entertained the country, and made fortunes for their proprietors—no small feat.</td>

While Chinese authorities hadn’t said Mr. Hsu had done anything wrong in China, he told the Associated Press last year that local authorities barred him from leaving in an apparent effort to pressure his father, who is in the U.S., to return to face charges in China.

The case concerns the night of Aug. 25, 2020: Mr. Rittenhouse shot and killed two men and wounded another as he patrolled the city with a rifle and a small medical kit amid unrest after the police shooting of Jacob Blake.<br />Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed the misdemeanor charge of possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 17 years old. The defense had argued a person of that age could carry such a weapon under Wisconsin law as long as it wasn’t a short-barreled rifle. After the prosecution conceded that the AR-15-style rifle didn’t have a short barrel, Judge Schroeder dropped the charge. The judge also agreed to allow prosecutors to offer jurors a number of less serious charges to consider if they can’t agree on the more serious charges.</td>

Because the daughters are Venus and Serena Williams, and Richard, played with magisterial zest by Will Smith, is the relentless taskmaster, disciplinarian, teacher, self-anointed moralist, pro tem agent and self-taught coach who is determined to lift them out of the ghetto, which Richard pronounces fastidiously as “get-toe,” by making them two of the greatest tennis players the world has ever seen. Through all the rigors of their training, though, the girls, played delightfully by Saniyya Sidney (she’s Venus) and Demi Singleton (she’s Serena), sustain high spirits and remain beguiling gigglers. The movie, playing in theaters and streaming on HBO Max, pulls off a similar trick. It’s serious at bottom. It means to teach and inspire, as well as entertain, and takes on more subjects of consequence than you can shake a racket at—among them race, parenting, marital dynamics, the weight of personal history and the mad commercialization of sports. Yet it’s marvelous fun from start to finish.</td>

      <td>The Hulu series, very loosely based on the life of Catherine the Great, returns</td>
      <td>In “Topsy-Turvy,” Mike Leigh’s 1999 masterpiece about Gilbert & Sullivan, actress Wendy Nottingham delivers the old line: “The more I see of men, the more I admire dogs.” Dogs also come off relatively well in “The Great,” which returns to Hulu on Friday, visiting a much earlier historical period, with far less music, far more violence and much more sex. But the male behavior is mangy enough that an empire hangs in the balance.<br />What hangs over the second-season debut of the series—an “occasionally true story” about Catherine the Great (Elle Fanning)—is whether the show could maintain its often delicious balance of the elegant and the vulgar, the decorous and the disgusting, the carnal and the carnivorous. Based on the Australian writer Tony McNamara’s play and scripted largely by him, the inaugural “Great” maintained an edge despite hinging largely on one joke, or maybe one surprise: that the lushly costumed people of 18th-century St. Petersburg—inhabiting the Winter Palace as well as a tumultuous era in feudal history—might talk like they were in a David Mamet play and act like rutting beasts. It was like “Bridgerton” on the Volga.</td>

(Literally so; it’s playing in select theaters.)<br />The production is framed as a road movie in which a radio journalist named Johnny (remarkable work by Joaquin Phoenix) reopens his closed-off self in the course of trying to cope with the comical whims and exasperating moods of his 9-year-old nephew, Jesse (Woody Norman, who is flat-out wonderful). The kid is whip smart, startlingly articulate and blissfully funny, but he’s all over the place in an unsettling way that defies description. My first impulse was to find the right word to describe it, and I remembered one that I must have encountered in a book about psychology. Jesse’s behavior is labile, an adjective that sounds precise but turns out to be little more than a clinical term for emotions that are all over the place.</td>

You can book them a mini spa treatment in one of Paris’s most glamorous new hotels or an online mezcal mixology class based in Mexico City. Or perhaps you’d prefer to wrap up items that travel well but are just as gratifying at home (handmade Turkish slippers, for one, or pajamas from Claridge’s in London). And because air travel hasn’t gotten any more pleasurable, we’re also suggesting a collection of cuddly neck pillows. Whichever present you choose, all are 100% more likely to feed wanderlust than, say, socks.<br />In case international travel isn’t on your giftee’s calendar just yet, sign him or her up for a cooking class through  Airbnb ’s  Online Experiences program. Courses range from preparing pasta from scratch with nonnas in Italy to mixing mezcal cocktails with a bartender in Mexico City. After the 60-to- 90-minute sessions, the instructors email recipes, so those newfound skills can be paid forward to the delight of dinner guests. Classes from $30 per person, airbnb.com</td>

      <td>An agreement to waive the intellectual-property rights underpinning Covid-19 vaccines—a prospect poor countries have hoped would ease supplies to the developing world—is becoming increasingly unlikely, say people familiar with the situation, with the U.S. not acting to bridge disagreements between developing world countries and those opposing such a measure.<br />In May, the Biden administration said it would support temporarily suspending patents and other IP linked to the shots to allow developing countries to produce the Covid-19 vaccines created by big drug companies.</td>

      <td>Savory gift ideas for readers craving kitchen inspiration or a taste of culinary history.</td>
      <td>As Thanksgiving looms, filling many home cooks with dread, it’s worth repeating what the writer Laurie Colwin had to say on the subject. In “The Family Dinner in Real Life,” she lays the blame for our anxiety at the feet of the painter Norman Rockwell: “I myself am reduced to worm size when contemplating his famous illustration of the farm family Thanksgiving table, with the beaming grandparents and the children with their hair combed. How happy they all look! And how politely and still the children sit!” Contemplating this enchanting Thanksgiving picture, she wonders: “Why do I suspect that the grandfather drinks more than he should, that the mother and father have had a few bitter words in the kitchen about the in-laws, or the mom has told the dad how much she resents doing all the cooking when all he has done is watch the football game and never so much as poke his head into the kitchen to ask if she needed help, and that the aunt is taking either antidepressants or mood elevators?”<br />Colwin’s humor calms you down. It’s a treat to read her classic cookbook-memoirs,“Home Cooking” and “More Home Cooking,” which have just been reissued. She writes in a breezy conversational style as if she were an old friend giving you sensible advice. I can imagine her coming into my kitchen, lightly slapping away my hand from the chopping board and taking over: This is how to do it.</td>

Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) raised concerns about how President Biden’s Build Back Better bill would affect the economy, the national debt, entitlements and especially inflation. To assess the bill’s potential consequences, he demanded, among other things, a complete budgetary scoring by the Congressional Budget Office, with no gimmicks, program sunsets or phony savings.<br />Based on all precedents, the CBO report, expected to come out this week, will chronicle all the bill’s budgetary games. When all the gimmicks and sunsets are taken into account, the White House claim that the bill is fully paid for is the most fraudulent scoring claim ever made for a major policy proposal in the modern era. And the bipartisan bar is high.</td>

      <td>Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro has called China his service’s “most significant” challenge, and he’s dead right. Recent satellite images suggest China has been building a model of an American aircraft carrier in the desert to use as target practice. It’s clear the rising power intends to hit the U.S. Navy’s most visible and valuable ships at sea. Yet the American carrier fleet isn’t set up to strike Chinese targets ashore. Instead of addressing this major vulnerability, the Navy is throwing time, money and energy into a new jet-fighter program.<br />Not much is known about the “next generation air dominance,” or NGAD, aircraft. Official statements report that it will be a “family of systems,” perhaps a manned aircraft working with unmanned companions, and that it will feature new stealth technologies. Rumors suggest that it will be somewhat comparable to the F-14 Tomcat, made famous by the 1986 movie “Top Gun,” whose primary job was defending the carrier and other ships.</td>

For Vladimir Putin, by contrast, it was “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.” At least no one disputes its momentous significance.<br />Naturally, the literature on the Soviet breakup is vast. It includes incisive chronicles by historians such Serhii Plokhii and Stephen Kotkin and by diplomats such as Jack Matlock, the former U.S. ambassador to Moscow. There are also biographical studies of Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader and the central figure in this drama. With “Collapse: The Fall of the Soviet Union,” the Moscow-born historian Vladislav Zubok, a professor at the London School of Economics, adds his voice to the chorus of narrative and analysis. He uses archival material—along with interviews and memoirs—to construct a compelling account.</td>

      <td>Russia’s ruler senses weakness in the U.S. military’s reliance on satellites.</td>
      <td>Russia successfully conducted a test in which a direct-ascent missile destroyed a nearly 40-year-old defunct Soviet spy satellite, U.S. Space Command announced Monday. This unsettling development is noteworthy because it coincides with Russia’s massive military buildup along the Ukrainian border. Moscow’s pre-positioning of more than 100,000 soldiers, tanks and heavy weaponry has spurred the Pentagon’s concerns about a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine.<br />Moscow’s posturing on what the Russians call a “space weapon” signals a rapidly escalating crisis in U.S.-Russia relations. Washington’s foreign policy and Moscow’s view of its national interests are on a geopolitical collision course. Russia views the formerly Soviet Ukraine as part of its strategic security perimeter, on which Moscow has relied for centuries as a geographical buffer against foreign invasion. President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly said the U.S. is crossing a red line by attempting to pull Ukraine out of Russia’s orbit.</td>

      <td>In the streaming age, local stations are an underappreciated part of a community.</td>
      <td>Austin, Texas<br />Nothing makes me feel more Texan than rocketing down a 75-mile-an-hour highway in a gas guzzler while blasting classic country radio. Stations that play country music are ubiquitous—it’s the most popular radio genre—but in Texas, the deep tracks are a little deeper and George Strait plays every hour. KVET Austin is my station of choice, and tuning in has helped me connect to the city since I moved here from New York over the summer.</td>

      <td>A collection of books that offer insight and guidance for negotiating the work-life balance and resetting for a post-pandemic career.</td>
      <td>We are a nation of workaholics. Americans work, on average, more hours than our counterparts in any peer nation, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The Covid-19 crisis only deepened our obsession with productivity. In 2020, employee engagement rates hit record highs as workers doubled down on their jobs to fend off layoffs, financial uncertainty and social isolation.<br />Then many of us hit a wall. A March 2021 survey by the job-aggregator site Indeed found more than half of respondents said they felt burned out. A month later, four million people quit. And while millions more remain unemployed after losing their jobs due to Covid, employers are reporting an acute labor shortage: In September the Great Resignation continued with more than 4.4 million workers, or 3% of the workforce, leaving their jobs. We’re at an inflection point as we re-evaluate how, where and when we want to work. Maybe this is a chance to discover a cure for our workaholism and achieve that ever-elusive work-life balance.</td>

      <td>A set of new books chronicle a legendary basketball team—and even a fan for its rivals finds much to love.</td>
      <td>On April 18, 1969, the dynastic Boston Celtics, featuring Bill Russell in the twilight of his career and John Havlicek in the prime of his, led the New York Knickerbockers in the NBA Eastern Conference Finals, three games to two. I was 15 years old and the Knicks were my passion. Game Six was held at Boston Garden, famous for its parquet floor and for a bald man named Red Auerbach perched in a courtside seat, victory cigar at the ready. I watched the game on the portable black-and-white TV in my bedroom.<br />It was a back-and-forth contest from the beginning. But in the closing minutes, the Celtics surged ahead; the dagger was a high-degree-of-difficulty bank shot by Havlicek with nine seconds left. The buzzer sounded with the Celtics up by a point, leaving me in a state of rage and despair I had never before experienced.</td>
