Kudos to the Justices for taking this opportunity to vindicate equal treatment under the law regardless of race, especially when the left is pushing racial calculations into policies far beyond campus.<br />This also is a chance for the Court to correct its own mistakes. Racial quotas are forbidden, but in Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), a 5-4 majority endorsed the idea that race could be a “plus” factor to help colleges seek “the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.” Yet there was an expiration date: “We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.”</td>

They imposed only two explicit restrictions: States could not use the money to directly or indirectly cut taxes. Nor may they deposit any pandemic money into public-worker pension funds.</td>

The bad news is that the main strategies for slowing its spread—repeated testing, masks and vaccine boosters—are largely futile for that purpose. The good news is that while protecting the vulnerable remains vital, slowing the spread of the virus needn’t be the priority. The biggest danger from Omicron is probably acute hospital staffing shortages, in part because of asymptomatic employees who stay home from work after testing positive.<br />Although Covid testing can be useful, it also has important limitations. The “gold standard” PCR tests are frequently too sensitive; research has shown that in many cases people who test positive are no longer contagious. The increasingly used rapid antigen tests have the opposite problem, often failing to detect infections during the earlier part of the five-day isolation period of presumed contagiousness.</td>

Exhibit A is the new Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg.<br />New York State’s Constitution, like the U.S. Constitution, divides government into three equal branches—legislative, executive and judicial—to ensure checks and balances that protect liberty and democratic self-government. New York’s Constitution requires that the state Legislature write and pass the laws, while the role of the executive branch is to carry out those laws as drafted.</td>

      <td>The territory's crushing debt load has been lifted.</td>
      <td>Puerto Rico has completed the biggest public-debt restructuring in American history, whittling $33 billion of obligations down to $7 billion over the past five years and rescuing its pension system. To put this in perspective, Puerto Rico resolved three times as much debt as Detroit did in its bankruptcy and more than 10 times Detroit’s unfunded pension liability. “It is the court’s hope and expectation,” Judge Laura Taylor Swain said after approving the restructuring, “that the confirmation of the plan marks the beginning of Puerto Rico’s brightest chapter.”<br />The most innovative features of the plan of adjustment seek to ensure that repayment never becomes unaffordable. The recoveries of many creditors are based in part on a contingent-value instrument linked to sales-tax revenue. Only if the revenue is higher than projected—and thus, Puerto Rico’s economy is doing well—will creditors receive a higher recovery.</td>

Mr. Putin has three linked goals: to restore as much of the old Soviet empire as possible, to break the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and to disrupt the European Union. The diplomatic demands, propaganda campaigns, cyberattacks and military maneuvers he has unleashed have brought him significantly closer to his principal goals. Instead of responding effectively, Mr. Putin’s Western opponents have lurched deeper into division and incoherence.<br />Not since the 1940s has the West been this disunited. Germany refuses to allow NATO allies to ship German-made weapons to Ukraine. France chooses the Western alliance’s most critical hour since the 1961 Berlin Crisis to call for a fundamental rethinking of Western political structures and relations. Britain goes all-in on arming Ukraine. The European disarray reflects the West’s fundamental weakness: Washington hasn’t been able yet to forge a consensus that enables the West to pursue a common objective.</td>

      <td>Religious communities teach the importance of respecting authority and being cooperative. Such lessons can boost classroom performance.</td>
      <td>What kind of child does well in school? The answer is hardly surprising: one who has respect for authority, an ability to get along with fellow students, a stable family, exposure to responsible adults and a feeling of hope. These days, in the U.S., such characteristics are more often found among middle- and upper-class children than among less-well-off students. What if there were one particular element in a child’s experience that could foster such characteristics in everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status?<br />In “God, Grades, and Graduation,” Ilana Horwitz suggests that religion can play such a role. Of course, nothing is simple, and Ms. Horwitz’s analysis is anything but reductive or unnuanced. But she finds a rich store of data to support such a claim in the National Study of Youth and Religion, a large-scale longitudinal survey run by the University of Notre Dame. Young people who are “abiders”—that is, who are active in religious communities and who have adopted their family’s faith as their own—“are likely to have an academic advantage because religion and schools are complementary institutions.” In particular, “adolescents who thrive in one institution are likely to thrive in the other.”</td>

      <td>Tom Vilsack sees exploitation where it doesn’t exist.</td>
      <td>Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack’s letter “Big Meat Takes Advantage of Small Producers” (Jan. 19) expresses concern about farmers and ranchers receiving declining shares of what consumers spend for meats. Such statistics are commonly said to support claims that large middlemen are exploiting small ranchers and farmers, exerting monopoly power against consumers or both. The Justice Department investigated such claims in 2010, while I was a staff economist there. My 2011 academic article “The Illusion of Anticompetitive Behavior Created by 100 Years of Misleading Farm Statistics” offers my conclusions from analyzing the data that USDA and other agencies had made public.<br />The fraction of consumer food spending that went to farmers declined substantially throughout the 20th century. That decline was fully explained, however, by the substantial movement of food preparation out of homes and into the marketplace. This was a result of women working more in the paid labor force, leaving them less time to spend on unpaid in-home food processing and preparation. The shifts to buying fully prepared food (eaten in restaurants or delivered) and purchasing more highly processed and prepared foods (e.g., filleted, closely trimmed and seasoned cuts of meat as opposed to slabs from a local butcher) reduced time spent in homes preparing meals.</td>

Four years ago, it was Allbirds’s wooly, $95 sock-like shoes cladding feet across New York City, and appearing to find a particularly strong foothold with tech-bro types.<br />Recently, I’ve observed a similar shoe surge, this time, of Loro Piana’s minimalistic Open Walk slip ons, which the brand has sold since 2005, but for many reasons seem to have soared in popularity of late. They’re tough to describe: Though the sole is white and rubber like a sneaker’s, the upper is supple and a bit chiseled, recalling an Italian Chukka boot. (Loro Piana is based in Milan, Italy.) Suede Open Walks retail for $1,050, and a pair in deerskin will chomp $2,425 out of your checking account. Their more-loafery sibling, the Summer Walk, recalls laceless Sperry boat shoes—but cost $995 in leather, roughly ten times as much (and $875 in suede).

      <td>The biggest and boldest claim of ESG investors is that investing based on environmental, social and governance conditions will not just improve our world, but make you more money. I have problems with both parts of the claim. The burgeoning market for green bonds shows the difficulties clearly, and stocks with a sustainability label aren’t so different.<br />Green bonds, where governments or companies promise to spend at least some of the proceeds on something environmentally friendly, are having their moment. More were sold last year than ever, and this year global issuance is forecast by  BNP Paribas  to climb another 60% to $900 billion. The U.K.’s first green government issue, last summer, attracted the highest demand ever for a British bond, and the green tinge is rapidly spreading from Europe to the rest of the world.</td>

What’s a stakeholder? Basically, it’s any individual or group allegedly affected by the company’s decisions.<br />The idea caught on. Fifty years later, around 3,000 billionaires and millionaires, heads of state, rock stars, and hangers-on flock to the annual gathering. (The 2021 Forum was held remotely, and this year’s meeting has been delayed until spring.) The language of stakeholder capitalism permeates politics and economics. Mr. Schwab did more than build an institution. He created a social type: the globe-trotting, well-connected, extremely wealthy do-gooder whom the late political scientist Samuel P. Huntington called “Davos Man.”</td>

      <td>Canada’s supply-management system provides a positive example.</td>
      <td>A recent ruling under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement fails to address the problems confronting dairy farmers in any meaningful way (“U.S. Wins Ruling on Canada Dairy Tariffs,” U.S. News, Jan. 5). On the contrary, it dismisses the positive example of Canada’s dairy supply-management program, which has stabilized the supply of milk, provided protective subsidies to small farmers, ensured most of the dairy production is consumed domestically and offered fairer prices to farmers and consumers.<br />Canada’s quota system has enabled dairy farmers to invest in more sustainable, climate-friendly farming practices. Their average dairy herd size is 97 cows, allowing more opportunities for pasture grazing and soil carbon sequestration. This combination of minimal emissions and maximum soil carbon retention constitutes one of the most positive versions of dairy production.</td>

Or sentient.<br />Larger chains and smaller inns are moving past the custom of having guests press “0” on a landline phone to ask for that extra towel. Instead, properties have turned to text messages. That means requests could get answered by someone in another state, a bot or a digital spider monkey.</td>

A growing outbreak at a public housing estate has prompted the government to lock down buildings and send more people into quarantine.</td>

The state is seeing rising sea levels, and Florida’s environmental and economic successes are intertwined, Mr. DeSantis and other speakers said.<br />The Republican governor, unlike many of his Democratic counterparts, didn’t use the term “climate change” or endorse specific policies aimed at combating factors that most climate scientists say are driving warming, such as greenhouse-gas emissions. He focused on responding to the effects of a warming climate.</td>
