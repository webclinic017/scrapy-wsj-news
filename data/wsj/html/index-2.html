      <td>Elizabeth Warren finally got her woman—that is, the Senator and her many acolytes in the Biden Administration have succeeded in ousting Jelena McWilliams as chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The coup deserves attention because of its norm-breaking precedent and what it signals for bank mergers and supposedly independent regulatory agencies.<br />Ms. McWilliams resigned on Dec. 31, effective Feb. 4, to avoid more turmoil at the bank regulator. But as she wrote in these pages on Dec. 16, her resignation comes amid a concerted and unprecedented political effort to strip her of authority before her term as chair expires in June 2023.</td>

      <td>One hundred and fifty political scientists signed an open letter to Congress six weeks ago declaring that “midnight is approaching” for American democracy. Among their concerns was Republican gerrymandering. They wrote that “drawing fair district boundaries . . . should not be partisan”—but the GOP has shown “a clear intent to entrench minority rule.”<br />It has been an article of faith among those who claim to be most knowledgeable about American politics that this year’s House of Representatives redistricting would give Republicans an edge in November and even keep the GOP in power indefinitely despite public opposition.</td>

The maximum duration of benefits was extended to as many as 99 weeks from the typical 26.</td>

Chicago’s increase was 5% and Los Angeles suffered a 13% rise in killings. The 2021 figures follow a scary 2020, when the nationwide homicide rate (6.5 per 100,000) was the highest in 23 years.<br />The pandemic, along with dubious criminal-justice system reforms, undoubtedly made things worse. Covid made police reluctant to interact with suspects except when making arrests for serious crimes. Wholesale releases from jails like New York’s Rikers Island put offenders back on the streets. Some states adopted bail reforms that kept offenders from jail entirely. It didn’t help that a new crop of progressive prosecutors, in misguided efforts to reduce so-called mass incarceration, declined to prosecute numerous misdemeanors and agreed to light sentences even for some violent felons.</td>

From pushing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to block bank mergers to attacking bank overdraft fees, Mr. Chopra is moving aggressively. If the CFPB’s inquiries into “Buy Now Pay Later” credit and pawn loans are a leading indicator, it seems only a matter of time before Mr. Chopra revisits the perpetual progressive irritant—payday loans.<br />A study we recently completed questions the wisdom and legality of the CFPB’s last attempt to regulate payday loans, a rule from 2017. This rule provides the template for efforts to regulate payday loans out of existence. That massive rule limited payday-loan customers to no more than six loans a year unless they could meet a rigid government-mandated ability-to-repay standard.</td>

We marched on the Pentagon and occupied college administration buildings. In the 1970s we mellowed, listened to the Band and the Eagles, and read Charles Reich’s “The Greening of America.” In the 1980s we rebounded as yuppies. We became investment bankers and lawyers, and the women among us wore suits with padded shoulders. Thereafter we ascended to political power—not always wisely, truth be told. But our music had lyrics and melodies, and our protest songs took on real injustices. We cemented a civil-rights revolution for women and minorities and left a mark on all succeeding generations.</td>

But with the acceptance of generics, prescription drugs must earn virtually all their returns on new drugs before they go off patent and prices plummet amid generic competition.

But Western officials and  defense experts are growing more convinced of the closer relationship based on recent economic alliances, military exercises and joint defense development, as well as the few public statements from government leaders.</td>

      <td>The Cornell-Harvard hockey matchup is legendary. Harvard home fans used to play square-dance music and throw hay on the ice making fun of bumpkins from upstate New York. In retaliation, Cornell fans at Lynah Rink in Ithaca would throw fish on the ice (they still do despite being searched on entry), and for many years they even tied a live chicken to Harvard’s goal. I spoke with a recent graduate who explained how students have modernized taunting. Using fake social-media accounts with pictures of attractive coeds, hecklers would inevitably “friend” Harvard’s goalie and learn details about his personal life. During the game, the crowd would taunt him about his aunt Millie, dog Muffin or recent breakup. Eventually the goalie would turn and stare at the crowd in confusion. Successful psy-ops!<br />The same tactics are leaking into war planning. Psychological operations are nothing new: We’ve had Tokyo Rose, pamphlets dropped from planes, and Iraq’s Information Minister Baghdad Bob’s spewing lies on CNN. Now Instagram? In February 2012, I wrote a column titled “When Will Social Media Elect a President?” Most readers said never. Well, that ship has sailed. It’s time to ask: When will social media alter wars?</td>

In Spanish, anything pertaining to Latin culture or background is described as either “latino” or “latina,” uncapitalized. The gender distinction is a basic characteristic of romance languages, used not only to distinguish male or female, but also objects or concepts that by convention are assigned a gender: “musica latina” (Latin music) or “sabor latino” (Latin flavor).<br />In English, such a distinction does not exist. But as Ms. Allen suggests, there is already a perfectly appropriate English word, a direct translation from both “latino” and “latina” that totally describes the concept: “Latin.” I always found the capitalized use of the Spanish words unnecessary in English. Now, with this new fad of “Latinx,” we have arrived at an entirely new dimension, with a made-up word to satisfy some obscure political correctness.</td>

      <td>Streetwise started the year with a prescient forecast: There is plenty of scope to be horribly wrong about predictions of speculative excess. As 2021 draws to a close, it is a good time for investors to look back at the decisions they made over the year, and why they made them, with the hope of learning from their mistakes. My mistakes are preserved for posterity in public columns, but investors should keep a diary of why they entered each trade, to avoid the human tendency to rationalize with hindsight.<br />Both my biggest mistake and one of my biggest successes was Tesla. Start with the mistake: In mid-January I argued that Tesla and other electric-car stocks were in a “wild bubble.” Tesla stock was at $845, up almost 20% in the first two weeks of the year and an eye-watering 685% in the previous 12 months. While it did fall hard for several months, it is now back above $1,000, helped both by an extraordinary rally in October and by another 20% gain in the days around Christmas. “Horribly wrong” just about captures it.</td>

In a sense, that is unsurprising: during downturns small companies, which lack leverage with suppliers and usually have shakier access to finance, often tend to do worse. But by some measures there has been a longer-term downward drift in the fortunes of China’s small companies across business cycles, which is more worrying and suggests a structural deterioration in the environment for entrepreneurs.</td>

He saw the 1999 movie “Pirates of Silicon Valley,” about Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, and decided America was the place he must be.<br />His memory of arriving at John F.

State regulators will inspect out-of-state farms to ensure they are in compliance. A business owner or operator—including supermarkets, restaurants and meat processors—found to be violating the law could be charged with a misdemeanor punishable with fines up to $1,000 or as many as 180 days in jail, as well as civil penalties.

Such funding was rampant in 2020—in North Carolina and nationwide—and it likely benefited Democrats. Some states have already enacted a ban, and more should follow before the 2022 midterms.<br />Gov. Cooper vetoed a bill passed by the Republican legislature. Lawmakers were responding to 2020’s unprecedented phenomenon of individuals and organizations, usually from out of state, providing grants directly to state and local election officials. The money came from a variety of sources, but the largest by far was $400 million from Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, and his wife, Priscilla Chan. Primarily routed through the Center for Tech and Civic Life, the funding was dispersed to roughly 2,500 counties in 47 states and the District of Columbia. The center described it as a means of ensuring “safe and reliable” voting amid the pandemic, and while jurisdictions had to request the money, there was no mechanism for oversight or accountability once they had the funds in hand.</td>
