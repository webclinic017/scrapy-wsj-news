      <td>Why is the jobless rate so much higher in Democratic-run states?</td>
      <td>Our liberal friends like to say the U.S. is experiencing a two-track pandemic recovery. They’re right about the symptoms but wrong about the diagnosis. The Labor Department’s state jobs report for June, released last Friday, shows an increasing economic divergence between states run by Republicans and Democrats, and the real reasons are worth noting.<br />While Democratic governors maintained longer and stricter lockdowns during the pandemic, most began to ease business restrictions in the spring. Nearly all were lifted by mid-June. So it’s striking that Democratic states in June still boasted significantly higher unemployment and slower job growth.<br />Unemployment was lowest in Nebraska (2.5%), Utah (2.7%), South Dakota (2.9%), New Hampshire (2.9%), Idaho (3%), Vermont (3.1%), Alabama (3.3%), Montana (3.7%) and Oklahoma (3.7%). All are governed by Republicans, except Vermont, which has a GOP Governor and Democratic Legislature.<br />By contrast, the states with the highest unemployment are all run by Democrats: Connecticut (7.9%), New Mexico (7.9%), Nevada (7.8%), California (7.7%), Hawaii (7.7%), New York (7.7%), New Jersey (7.3%) and Illinois (7.2%). Mere coincidence?<br />Hawaii and Nevada rely on tourism, which will take time to fully bounce back. But what’s Illinois’s excuse? Other Midwest states with a mix of agriculture and manufacturing have unemployment rates near what they were at the end of President Obama’s second term. That includes Wisconsin (3.9%), Indiana (4.1%), Missouri (4.3%) and Kentucky (4.4%).</td>

      <td>CEO Evan Spiegel says he hopes some content will rebound as life returns to normal</td>
      <td>Snap Inc.’s  revenue more than doubled in the second quarter and user growth jumped the most in four years, as people continued to flock to the social-media app despite a return to more normal daily routines.<br />The company projects revenue in the current quarter will climb as much as 60% as its pandemic-era popularity continues, even as the health crisis wanes.<br />The Santa Monica, Calif.-based company said Thursday its closely watched daily active user figure reached 293 million in the second quarter, exceeding the roughly 290 million Wall Street was expecting. Snap had 238 million active daily users in the year-ago period.<br />Snap shares were up more than 10% in after-hours trading on Thursday. They have more than doubled over the past year.<br />The company, best known for disappearing photos and messages on its Snapchat app that is popular with teens and young adults, has impressed investors with its growth during the pandemic, outpacing much larger rivals. It has introduced new features to appeal to businesses beyond traditional social-media advertising, including a push into augmented reality.</td>

      <td>The U.S. again delays reopening the border to our northern friends.</td>
      <td>President Biden has a major problem on the southern U.S. border, so you’d think his Administration would be focusing its efforts there. But this week he delayed re-opening the border with Canada for another month for fear of Covid-19’s Delta variant.<br />Canadians won’t be able to enter the U.S. until Aug. 21, though Canada recently said it will allow Americans to go north on Aug. 9. This isn’t neighborly American behavior, and it’s not consistent with what the Biden Administration likes to call “the science.”<br />Canada had a rocky start to its Covid vaccination program, largely due to supply problems. But it has rapidly picked up the pace and is now doing better than the U.S. at getting people to roll up their sleeves. Health Canadareported this week that nearly 70% of its population has received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose. More than 50% of Canadians are now fully vaccinated, while the U.S. rate is 48.6%.<br />If the vaccines provide protection from severe Covid, as the Biden Administration avers, then why continue the blockade against vaccinated Canadians entering the U.S.? And if Canadians can’t come here, why should Canada allow Americans to enter since there’s more vaccine resistance in the U.S.?<br />Canadians haven’t been allowed to cross the U.S. border since March 24, 2020 unless they can show that they’re traveling on essential business or they quarantine for two weeks. This has taken a major bite out of the integrated border economy.</td>

      <td>New legislation could make the island harder for Beijing to control.</td>
      <td>The best way to forestall a catastrophic Chinese invasion of Taiwan is to raise the costs for Beijing. That means ensuring Taiwan’s own forces are prepared for the worst. A new American legislative proposal aims to bolster Taiwan’s deterrence by improving the island’s ability to call up its reserve forces in case of an invasion.<br />The Taiwan Partnership Act, sponsored by Republican Sen. John Cornyn and Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, is notable for its bipartisanship. The House version is backed by Rep. Mike Gallagher, plus one other Republican and two Democrats. The short bill instructs the Pentagon to study greater coordination between the U.S. National Guard and Taiwan’s military.<br />Specifically, American defense planners are encouraged to develop “programs for National Guard advisors to assist in training the reserve components of the military forces of Taiwan.” The reserve forces aren’t the front lines of Taiwan’s naval or missile defense, but they would provide additional manpower if the island’s population had to mobilize for war.<br />A 2017 Rand Corporation report on Taiwan’s reserves noted that “island warfare in the Second World War first demonstrated the need for an attacking force to have a large numerical advantage in order to secure victory.” Calling up reserves could multiply the size of Taiwan’s active-duty military of under 200,000 by a factor of 10.<br />An organized and equipped reserve force would make Taiwan more difficult to control even if People’s Liberation Army amphibious forces or paratroopers landed on the island. Broad-based resistance can help a smaller state hold out against a larger foe, perhaps buying time for U.S. and other forces to arrive. Lithuania, for example, relies on mobilizing its reserves in case of a Russian attack.</td>

      <td>Mark another one up for Elizabeth Warren. The Massachusetts Senator continues to fill out the Biden Administration with her allies, and the latest is Jonathan Kanter to run the Justice Department’s antitrust division. Apparently the conflict-of-interest standards she demanded of Trump appointees no longer apply.<br />At Justice Mr. Kanter would inherit the Trump antitrust suit against Google. Yet as a private antitrust attorney, Mr. Kanter represented  Microsoft  and other companies attacking Google. ( News Corp ,  which owns the Journal, was also a client.) President Biden’s executive order requires appointees to promise not to participate “in any particular matter involving specific parties that is directly and substantially related to my former employer or former clients, including regulations and contracts” for two years.<br />This is the same pledge President Trump imposed on his nominees. Former Federal Trade Commission Chair Joseph Simons recused himself from the agency’s lawsuit against  Qualcomm  since he had worked at a law firm advising the chip maker on its acquisition of  NXP Semiconductors ,  which China’s antitrust regulators scuttled.<br />Trump DOJ antitrust chief Makan Delrahim recused himself from the Google case because he had advised Google in 2007 when it sought FTC approval to buy the ad-tech company DoubleClick. Mr. Kanter’s work for Google’s rivals is more recent and equally if not more relevant to the litigation he’d oversee.<br />Does Mr. Kanter plan to seek an ethics waiver because of his long hostility toward Google? Senate Republicans should ask. Many joined Democrats in confirming progressive Lina Khan to the FTC despite her desire to rewrite antitrust law and break up big business. They were duped when Mr. Biden turned around and appointed her Chair.</td>

      <td>Efforts to bully him into retirement may end up having the opposite effect.</td>
      <td>A defining feature of today’s left is its willingness to shoot itself in the foot. See the campaign to bully Justice Stephen Breyer into retirement.<br />The intimidation hit new levels this week, following a CNN interview in which Justice Breyer dared suggest he might make use of his lifetime tenure a bit longer—being, as he is, of good health and sound mind. That declaration, combined with his decision to hire four clerks for the next term (suggesting an intention to stay) sent liberals into spasmodic finger-wagging.<br />“What is it with these justices?” fumed CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, accusing the 82-year-old justice of “gambling” with the future of the court. “This is about ego,” ranted Brian Fallon of the progressive Demand Justice group, scoring Justice Breyer for “acting recklessly.” Even elected Democrats are going there, with Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal chiding Justice Breyer over the “political dangers of waiting.” All this follows a monthslong campaign featuring online petitions, public letters, advertisements and a mobile billboard truck that circled the Supreme Court, reading “Breyer, retire.”<br />The push is as patronizing as it is political. Some progressives are insisting the old white guy has a moral obligation to make room for what President Biden has promised will be the court’s first black woman. The more honest pit bulls admit they are concerned about health—though not Justice Breyer’s. If he died tomorrow, they’d cheer Mr. Biden’s ability to nominate a replacement. Their real worry is that a Democrat in the 50-50 Senate will meet an end, handing the ability to block a nomination back to Mitch McConnell.<br />But the outrage misses key realities—for both the man in the robe and for the left. The left’s calls are coming at the moment that Justice Breyer is having the time of his judicial life. Confirmed in 1994, he spent more than 11 years as the court’s most junior member and another 15 in the seniority shadow of John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Now he is the most senior liberal justice, able to speak earlier and exert more influence in the justices’ private conferences and to assign the liberal wing’s dissents. He made clear in the CNN interview how much this new role means to him; why give it up?</td>

Then moms in veils or straw hats strap infants to their torsos and follow their husbands, themselves with toddlers on each arm, across the parking lot. These Catholics are flocking to St. Mary’s Church, de facto home of the Latin Mass in the mostly rural Diocese of Kalamazoo, for a distinct religious obligation.<br />Despite last year’s lockdowns, total attendance at St. Mary’s has grown faster than anywhere in the diocese and almost doubled since 2020. These days the parish’s traditional masses average around 225 worshipers on Sunday. Other American parishes have made similar gains by offering what devotees refer to as the TLM or the Vetus ordo (“Old Order”), a joking reference to the Novus ordo promulgated in 1970.<br />The stable Latin Mass communities to which families like mine belong would have been unrecognizable to traditionalist Catholics in the 1980s and ’90s. In those days many drove several hours to sparsely attended Masses celebrated at odd hours in American Legion halls or the basements of private homes. Some families might have come with the priest in tow, carrying him to the next stop like a frontier clergymen.<br />Today many young priests celebrate the traditional Mass daily. Ancient taped-up pamphlet missals have been replaced with expensive leatherbound volumes. Austere half-hour celebrations have given way in some parishes to regular solemn Masses that require a master of ceremonies, priest, deacon and subdeacon. The liturgical standards in some parishes now may be higher than they were before the Second Vatican Council.</td>

      <td>For better and worse, the loss of my father shaped the next half-century of my life.</td>
      <td>Saturday is my 64th birthday. The same date will mark the 50th anniversary of a personal tragedy.<br />At 5 a.m. on my 14th birthday, my father—34, recently divorced and out partying with friends—was struck by a car as he was walking across a darkened Kendall Drive in Miami. He died instantly. The aftershocks have reverberated ever since.<br />When the Florida Highway Patrol trooper knocked on our front door at dawn to notify next of kin, my brother, a year older than I, opened the door. “Son,” the trooper told him, “why don’t you go back to your bedroom and let me talk to your mom.”<br />My mother told me the news when I woke up at 9 a.m. I remember the crack of sunlight beaming in beneath the shade on the windowsill in my bedroom and how my mom, still in shock, sat down at my bedside and reached out to pat me on the shoulder as she began to speak. “So, something bad has happened . . .”<br />Losing a parent is a devastating blow, no matter when it happens. When it occurs on your 14th birthday, it feels a bit more tragic, or maybe just more theatrical. And the reality is that everyone endures loss. Many people suffer far worse and recover remarkably well. How we respond to a life-altering setback, and what good lessons we can draw from it are key to shaping our lives for the better.</td>

      <td>Poignant miniatures of the personalities who make up Los Angeles, which is less a metropolis than an 88-city nation-state.</td>
      <td>What is Los Angeles? Depends on where you look. Some of the greatest chroniclers of the city’s civic life, from Upton Sinclair in the 1930s to Joan Didion in the 1960s, have chosen their own patch of land to cover. Ms. Didion is the most frequently quoted diviner of Los Angeles’s soul these days, but she decamped to Manhattan a long time ago, and the city is no longer the citrus-fragrant, deeply flawed “golden dream” that she wrote about in her seminal essays.<br />To drive around Los Angeles in 2021 is to witness a once-great city that has lost its moorings. What are we to make of a state with the fifth-largest economy in the world that hosts, in Los Angeles alone, America’s second largest homeless population, the tented encampments scattered like spores all over the city’s amoebic topography? An endless loop of fire, flooding and drought that has become as familiar as the city’s smog-pink sunsets.<br />In his deeply empathetic and insightful book “Everything Now: Lessons From the City-State of Los Angeles” (MCD, 254 pages, $27), Rosecrans Baldwin opts not to grasp for some unifying theory of Los Angeles that will sort it all out for readers. For Mr. Baldwin, who has previously published a novel and a memoir of living in Paris, Los Angeles is “less of a city than a country. Less of a community than a climate. Less of a metropolis than an eighty-eight-city nation-state.”<br />So how does the author wrap his arms around this complex city-state? By delivering poignant miniatures of individuals who make it their business to subvert L.A.’s stasis and apathy—the prevalent view that the individual is helpless in the absence of the state. In Mr. Baldwin’s world, the individual is the only change agent that works. “Everything Now” gives us dark glimpses of an impending apocalypse—the ever-expanding homeless population, therecurrent eco-cataclysms—then introduces us to a handful of resilient Angelenos doing their best to buck the tide of indifference that seems to have crept into the political and social life of the place like a toxic marine layer.<br />The author ducks into a hotel ballroom near the LAX airport to partake in a self-help seminar hosted by Mastery in Transformational Training (M.I.T.T.), a highly lucrative exercise in checkbook self-actualization founded by a Dutch woman named Margo Majdi. Turns out M.I.T.T. was born from the wreckage of a shady enterprise called Lifespring. No matter: Majdi rebranded it as M.I.T.T. and turned it into a highly lucrative business. Mr. Baldwin introduces the possibility that M.I.T.T. is, in fact, something like a cult. But for Mr. Baldwin it’s beside the point. Organizations like M.I.T.T. will always have a place in a city that is estranged from itself, where alienated residents fear the big dissolve and fade-out into oblivion, the fear that they are, in the end, “just another human in their apartment at the end of the day.” A city without a center can endure only if its citizens find connection within its 503 square miles. L.A. can get mighty lonely without it.</td>

      <td>Officials pushed trade and cooperation. Then came the pandemic and last year’s border clashes.</td>
      <td>Where have all the Indian panda huggers gone? Over the past two years, the once-ubiquitous commentary urging India to deepen cooperation with China and work together toward shaping an “Asian century” of continental dominance has all but vanished from Indian public discourse. It’s unlikely to reappear soon—to Washington’s benefit.<br />The double whammy of a made-in-China pandemic and military clashes in the Himalayas last year shattered the longstanding consensus in New Delhi that it could deepen economic and diplomatic ties with Beijing without resolving its longstanding border disagreement.<br />“It’s very clear that the template of India-China relations that held for three decades until 2019 is no longer valid,” says Gautam Bambawale, a former Indian ambassador to China, in a phone interview. “The new template has not yet been worked out, but relations will remain pretty tense and at a low level of equilibrium.”<br />India’s rift with China will likely accentuate its tilt toward the West, a welcome development from Washington’s perspective. (Secretary of State Antony Blinken is likely to visit New Delhi next week.) It also buries the idea, long floated by China boosters, that Asian powers should view the country’s rise positively. At this point, it’s obvious that the only Asian century that Beijing wants is a Chinese one.<br />Not long ago, many important voices in India made the case for deeper engagement with China. As recently as October 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping met for a two-day summit in the South Indian temple town of Mamallapuram, where they posed for photos meant to convey close ties. The previous year, Mr. Modi traveled to Wuhan for a similar meeting with Mr. Xi, where the photo-ops included the two leaders sharing a boat ride and strolling amid plum blossoms.</td>

      <td>From the 19th century’s smashes and slingflips to today’s mocktails, the only constant is refreshment.</td>
      <td>My favorite thing to drink this summer has been a super refreshing cucumber-mint limeade. I first made it one hot evening when my 12-year-old son and I were getting ready to watch a Euro 2020 soccer match. We squeezed lots of limes, mixed the juice with a bit of sugar syrup and blitzed it together with a whole peeled cucumber until it was a beautiful pale green color. Then we poured it into our prettiest glasses over ice, topped up with soda water and garnished with mint. It hit every spot you want in a summer drink. My son drank his straight up, but I added a shot of tequila to mine to make it into a cocktail.<br />What, actually, is a cocktail? It’s one of those words you can use hundreds of times in your life without ever asking where it comes from. In 19th-century America, cocktail was far from the only word for mixed alcoholic drinks. Like a sling (a drink made from brandy, rum or other spirits mixed with sugar, water and flavoring) or a toddy (much the same thing but with hot water and sometimes honey instead of sugar), cocktail originally meant a specific kind of mixed drink rather than mixed drinks in general. If history had taken a different course, we might all now speak of drinking drams, cobblers, coolers, smashes, juleps or—my personal favorite—slingflips.<br />In racing terms, a cocktail was originally a word for a horse that was a mixed breed rather than a thoroughbred. The idea of a cocktail-as-drink was that the alcohol was mingled with other ingredients, specifically with water, sugar and bitters (the original cocktail was basically a bittered sling). There were whiskey cocktails and gin cocktails and rum cocktails. These were excitingly flavored mixed drinks rather than pure spirit, and they were seen in the early 19th century as something you might drink in the morning, like coffee, to pep yourself up.<br />By 1917, when Tom Bullock published “The Ideal Bartender,” cocktails had assumed dozens of different forms, from Blue Blazer (flaming whiskey with sugar and lemon peel) to Leaping Frog (apricot brandy, lime and ice). The first Black American to publish a cocktail book, Bullock worked at the St. Louis Country Club and was renowned as the greatest mixologist of his time, versed in “the art of the julep.” He is sometimes credited as one of the inventors of the gimlet (gin and lime juice). It was said that his drinks were so good that no one could fail to finish one.<br />In more recent times, it seemed as if gimlets and juleps and slings were becoming archaic—like something out of the “Mad Men” era—in contrast to the simplicity of a glass of wine or beer. But with the pandemic, cocktails are back and more exciting than ever. Sri Lankan-British mixologist Ryan Chetiyawardana—the founder of Dandelyan in London, which has been named the world’s best bar—launched an online Master Class series on cocktail making in March 2020 which had a far bigger response than anticipated. Mr. Chetiyawardana, whose latest bar is Silver Lyan in Washington, D.C., suggested to me that the reason cocktail making found new fans over the past year is because “the act of making someone a cocktail feels very hospitable.” By sharing in the act of cocktail making over Zoom, friends and family could feel as if they were actually in the same room, enjoying the same icy-cold drink with the same mix of flavors, getting tipsy in unison.</td>

It’s also alarming for its ineptitude, but the film’s greatest distinction is how its wide-eyed, trembling vacationers manage to sustain a state of alarm that’s intense and unrelenting. As well they might. They’ve come to a fancy resort to get away from it all for a few days, but now, unable to leave a beautiful beach with mysterious powers, they’re getting older by the minute, and not because their suntan lotion has the wrong SPF for the tropics.<br />Good movies have been made in which young people suddenly age (“Lost Horizon”), old people regain their youth (“Cocoon”) or privileged people can’t seem to leave a place where they’ve gathered (“The Exterminating Angel”). But never before has a transfixingly terrible movie been made, at least by a major studio, in which so many people who turn out to be ill—their conditions range from cancer through epilepsy to calcium deficiency—are beset by so many alarming events while they hurtle through the stages of man and woman during the harrowing course of a day and night.<br />“Is this happening?” a statuesque blonde in a string bikini asks with acute alarm; she’s the one who’s short on calcium. People talk that way in Mr. Shyamalan’s films—in abrupt questions and off-kilter sentences that are definitely English but never quite colloquial. “There appears to be an event happening,” someone says early in “The Happening,” his 2008 paranoid thriller in which people do dreadful things to themselves because of some unspecified aberration of nature. Most of the time in “Old,” which the filmmaker adapted from “Sandcastle,” a graphic novel by Pierre Oscar Lévy and Frederik Peeters, events seem to happen in a similarly arbitrary way, with no time wasted on such abstruse matters as the meaning or preciousness of life. Eventually the film does provide an explanation, and it isn’t arbitrary so much as absurdly elaborate, preposterous and grandiose.<br />Who lives and who dies? You won’t find out here, though there’s no harm in noting that since canines have short lifespans in the best of times, the beach takes the ultimate toll on a dog. The cast includes Gael García Bernal, Vicky Krieps, Rufus Sewell, Thomasin McKenzie, Abbey Lee, Nikki Amuka-Bird, Ken Leung, Aaron Pierre, Francesca Eastwood, Kathleen Chalfant, Embeth Davidtz and Eliza Scanlen. Such a group would be a significant draw in other circumstances, but the beach’s malign power extends to turning excellent actors into wooden performers.<br />Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.com</td>

      <td>A National Geographic documentary on Disney+ celebrates Valerie Taylor, the photographer, filmmaker and conservationist who worked on ‘Jaws’ and is trying to rehabilitate the traditionally scary image of sharks.</td>
      <td>‘What we are dealing with here,” the actor Richard Dreyfuss says in “Jaws,” is “a perfect engine—an eating machine.” He can be heard saying it again during the introduction to “Playing With Sharks,” the story of photographer, diver and shark conservationist Valerie Taylor. Though Mr. Dreyfuss was describing what the fictional island village of Amity was up against in 1975, it also intimates what Ms. Taylor has been up against since she started trying to save sharks rather than kill them: the widely held view that “the only good shark is a dead shark,” an attitude she herself had a bit part in promoting.<br />“I wasn’t a ‘Bond girl,’” Ms. Taylor says at the beginning of this National Geographic production, but the fact that she was blond, beautiful and swam about with man-eating predators helped bring attention to the work of her and her documentarian husband, Ron. It probably also helps account for the wealth of footage at director Sally Aitken’s disposal, of Ms. Taylor above and below the water, on talk shows and on magazine covers. Her appearance in the 1971 documentary “Blue Water, White Death” made her a globally known adventurer, and a glamorous one. “I’m from a little village in Wales,” recalls one Taylor friend, “and our local policeman had posters of her up on his wall.”<br />The Taylors, who pioneered the use of shark cages and advanced techniques of underwater filming, were champion spearfishers turned nature filmmakers turned shark protectors. (Many great conservationists began as hunters, observes a Taylor colleague, marine biologist Jeremiah Sullivan; hunters are the ones closest to the wild.) Their underwater expertise put them in demand and gave them an almost accidental role in what Ms. Taylor might describe as shark slandering: The couple provided much of the technical know-how and photography on “Blue Water, White Death,” which inspired Peter Benchley to write the novel “Jaws,” which was the basis of the Hollywood blockbuster that made people afraid to go into the water.<br />The Taylors themselves shot the underwater shark footage for director Steven Spielberg in their native Australia, and “Playing With Sharks” includes much “Jaws” arcana (including footage of the smaller-than-usual shark cages and smaller humans used to make the great white villain of the film seem like it was actually 25 feet long). It also recounts Ms. Taylor’s public-relations efforts to counter the aftereffects of “Jaws,” which demonized great whites in particular and justified shark slaughter in general. “They didn’t listen to me,” says Ms. Taylor, now 85. “Frankly, they didn’t care.”<br />“Playing With Sharks” has its visual thrills but also tells one good story after another, not only about making movies and flirting with death but about the nature of the fish and the steely character of the movie’s human subject. She overcame polio as a young girl, walking again after no one said she would. The love story of Valerie and Ron Taylor (who died in 2012) is understated but real. There isn’t a lot about Ms. Taylor’s family, or that she first came to spearfishing as a way to help feed them. Her focus—she tells much of her own story—is about her life under water. She remembers trying to get a particular photo of a shark coming over a coral reef, with a view of the sunset through the water above. By plying a shark repeatedly with food, she trained it to do what she wanted, and got the shot—“faster than you could train a dog,” she adds. She thinks sharks are like dogs, that once we get to know them, they’re not so scary. She does, however, remember thinking “Now we die” when the decision was made to shoot “Blue Water, White Death” outside the shark cages.</td>

      <td>Twitter looked like a better deal before earnings, but growth changes the equation</td>
      <td>Social media made a splash on Thursday as its second-quarter earnings kicked off.<br />Both  Twitter Inc.  and  Snap ,  Inc. reported better-than-expected quarters, beating Wall Street’s estimates on both their top and bottom lines. Twitter’s sales growth shows it might be gaining more traction incrementally, at least among advertisers, but Snap’s record usage and revenue growth show its Snapchat platform remains the life of the party. Taken together, the reports shed a positive light on what investors can expect next week from  Facebook  and  Pinterest ,  which are set to report earnings on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.<br />Twitter said monetizable daily active users—a measure of its users who can view ads—grew 11% year on year. That’s down from an average of more than 25% growth over the previous six quarters, according to FactSet. But it also said its revenue grew 74% versus the same period last year, with U.S. advertising revenue nearly doubling. Snap, meanwhile, said both revenue and daily active users grew in the quarter at their highest annual rates in the last four years. Snap’s shares soared 13%, while Twitter’s rose 5%, in after hours trading on Thursday following the reports. With both companies providing a solid third-quarter outlook, choosy investors must now decide whether to take a chance on comeback kid Twitter or more-consistent Snap.<br />For its part, Twitter offered a lot of encouraging commentary. The company said it anticipates growing its revenue faster than expenses this year, even while it is now forecasting expenses will increase more than 30% in 2021 versus last year, up from previous guidance of more than 25%. It says it aims to benefit from the return of live sports, including the Tokyo Olympics over the next few weeks, as well as baseball and American football.<br />Importantly, the fact that the vast majority of Twitter’s ad revenue still comes from brand versus direct response ads will likely keep it somewhat insulated from  Apple ’s  iOS privacy changes since brand ads rely less on the need to track user activity. Snap said it is seeing higher opt-in rates to Apple’s new operating platform compared with the industry average. That implies it might be able to collect incrementally more third-party data on its users than some of its competitors. But the company, with revenue skewed more toward more vulnerable direct response ads, also said it anticipates the bulk of the effects of Apple’s changes are yet to come. Apple’s new system was introduced later than expected and the adoption cycle is ongoing.</td>

      <td>Debra Ann Byrd’s autobiographical solo show is a riveting account of her path to her career as a classical actress.</td>
      <td>Lenox, Mass.<br />In “BecomingOthello,” her new autobiographical solo show, Debra Ann Byrd tells how a single mother from Harlem became a classical actor who has, among other things, played the title role in three all-female versions of “Othello.” What makes her achievements even more remarkable is that Ms. Byrd could all too easily have ended up as a piece of inner-city jetsam. Her Puerto Rican father deserted the family early on, and her Black mother, shattered by depression and alcoholism, died a lonely death on the streets of East Harlem. As for Ms. Byrd, she became a single mother twice over, as well as the victim of a sickeningly brutal gang rape (she was drugged by her boyfriend). At one point she went so far as to consider killing herself.<br />But then, instead of leaping to her death from the roof of her apartment building, Ms. Byrd found salvation through Shakespeare. Fascinated both by acting and by Shakespeare’s use of the sublime language of the King James Bible, with which she had first become acquainted through going to church, she enrolled in a college drama program. Though a well-meaning but condescending professor assured Ms. Byrd that classical acting was not for her and suggested she stick to August Wilson, she went her own way, successfully starting her own classical theater troupe.<br />Working closely with Tina Packer, her director, Ms. Byrd has shaped this crowded tale into a full-evening monologue whose tendency to sprawl is offset by her limitless charisma. By turns play, sermon and Black history lesson, “Becoming Othello,” into which she has interpolated 200-odd pointedly chosen lines of Shakespeare, is also a show of uncanny timeliness, not least because playing Othello led her to start questioning her own sexual identity (a tale that she tells with irresistible good humor). While it will doubtless profit from further trimming, I expect we will hear much, much more about “Becoming Othello” and its prodigiously gifted author. Like Hal Holbrook’s “Mark Twain Tonight!” or John Gielgud’s “Ages of Man,” it’s the kind of solo show that an actor so inclined can spend the rest of his or her life playing in every corner of the English-speaking world.<br />—Mr. Teachout, the Journal’s drama critic, is the author of “Satchmo at the Waldorf.” Write to him at tteachout@wsj.com.</td>

      <td>Actor Val Kilmer gets a new kind of close-up in this documentary featuring never-before-seen footage from his personal archive.</td>
      <td>Val Kilmer is the subject, the star and, against steep odds, the unquenchable life force of “Val,” a feature documentary, playing in theaters, by Ting Poo and Leo Scott.<br />For anyone who has wondered whatever happened to the magnetic, volatile, seemingly guileless and sometimes otherworldly actor who was launched into Hollywood stardom nearly four decades ago by his performances as Iceman in “Top Gun,” Jim Morrison in “The Doors” and Doc Holliday in “Tombstone,” the answer on screen may come as a shock. What happened—after long-running career turmoil as well as financial and personal distress—was ravaging cancer, which left him with a tracheostomy and has severely limited his ability to speak. So the film takes some easing into. There’s also the minor but still startling matter of visual and informational clutter. It’s as if one of the Collyer brothers invited you in to show you a few things he’d grown attached to over the years, except that Mr. Kilmer’s things go beyond books, posters, newspapers, magazines, journals and roomfuls of cherished objects to include an exhaustive home-video record of his private, public and professional life to date.<br />Exhaustive but not exhausting. On the contrary, the fuzzy footage provides fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpses of Mr. Kilmer and his co-stars between takes on movie sets. And whatever he isn’t able to say in his own voice, straight to this latest camera confronting him, he says in voice-over passages written by him and relayed with warmth and feeling  by his son, Jack Kilmer, who is seen in the process of recording them. (The unspoken connection between father and son is ineffably moving.) The result is a documentary that keeps drawing you in, even when you think it’s keeping you at a certain distance, a one-of-a-kind portrait of a one-of-a-kind artist who, through good times and dreadful ones, has remained devoted to his art.<br />“I’ve kept everything,” he notes at the outset, “and it’s been sitting in boxes for years.” He amassed his archive, as he frames it, in order to tell a story about acting—“where you end and the acting begins.” That’s elusive territory for any performer to define. For Mr. Kilmer it has been, at various times in his life, a magical zone, a seductive mirage or a Sargasso of obsession, but always a sacred space of which to be worthy—even when he played Batman in the 1995 “Batman Forever” and struggled unavailingly to project a nuanced performance from inside the rubber suit. Now, he says, referring to the larger story of his acting, “part of the profound sadness is that it’s incomplete.”<br />Sadness claims its place in the film, as it has in his life, a response to mounting losses of love and possibility. And not just sadness but irreparable grief over the death of a beloved brother, Wesley, who drowned at age 15 during an epileptic seizure. Yet the dominant colors of “Val” as a whole are steadfast aspiration—in his beautiful teens he was the youngest applicant ever accepted as a drama student at Juilliard—and tacit gallantry in straitened circumstances. Sometimes he gets “the blues really, really bad” about keeping himself solvent by flying around the country to sign autographs for his fans: “It’s like the lowest thing you can do.” But it isn’t low, any more than it’s high. It’s making the best of a role he never sought, and playing it as he’s always tried to do, in the urgency of the moment.</td>

      <td>A new ‘American Masters’ documentary on PBS features archival footage and original interviews with Chicago’s pioneer blues guitarist.</td>
      <td>The makers of “Buddy Guy: The Blues Chase the Blues Away” don’t care if you don’t know about Buddy Guy. That he’s the most ferocious of electric guitarists. That he’s the last link to the glory days of Muddy Waters and Howlin’ Wolf. That a historical highway marker in his birthplace of Lettsworth, La., declares him “one of the most dazzling performers in blues history.” It’s a sign of enormous respect from the show: If you don’t know about him, you should. And Mr. Guy himself will now explain why.<br />Directed by Devin Amar, Matt Mitchener and Charles Todd, “The Blues Chase the Blues Away” is almost alarming in its departure from convention—much like Mr. Guy, as it happens. Customarily, “American Masters” presentations, and most biographical documentaries for that matter, spend an inordinate amount of time selling themselves. You’re told at length who the subject is, what he’s done and why you should care, per the testimony of an A-list of eyewitnesses. “The Blues Chase the Blues Away” is inspired by the musical journey of Mr. Guy from an impoverished childhood and a two-string guitar to the very electric blues of Chicago. It allows the singer-guitarist to tell his own story, reminisce about his childhood and reflect on his influences. The visual accents include archival footage and an assortment of illustrations that are quasi-naïve in their representation of the subject’s background, and Southern life in general. Those who are familiar with Mr. Guy may be eager for the guitar pyrotechnics to start. They will have to wait.<br />And wait they will, because the 84-year-old Rock & Roll Hall of Famer is an engaging host to his own show, playing his Stratocaster in emulation of John Lee Hooker and Lightnin’ Hopkins (the choice of guitar is much discussed) and talking in ironic ways about his hungry days in Chicago, where he drove a tow truck for a living as late as 1967. The stories resurrect such blues legends as Magic Sam, Otis Rush and, naturally, Muddy Waters, the singer with whom Mr. Guy, as a house guitarist at Chess Records, enjoyed a long association (and a salami sandwich, according to one memorable anecdote). Mr. Guy recorded with all the great acts on the label, but he could have been another Jimi Hendrix if the Chess brothers, Leonard and Phil, hadn’t refused to give him the space he needed and had recorded him the way he regularly performed live. By the time they came to their senses, in the late ’60s, as Mr. Guy recalls in the show, it was time to move on. His career—which included a longtime partnership with harmonica player Junior Wells—was as irregular as an amp with bad tubes.<br />It was the Brits who saved Buddy Guy—especially such British Invasion figures as Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton and Mr. Guy’s longtime champions, the Rolling Stones. Americans might have had no idea what Chess Records was, but the English guitarists were in awe of Mr. Guy. So are a number of younger stars who appear in the documentary—the gifted Gary Clark Jr., Kingfish and John Mayer, who delivers some quasi-unintelligible but enthusiastic praise of his idol. Mr. Guy is surprisingly frank about Chess Records and the way it ripped off its artists, stealing copyrights and royalties. Most of the people involved are long gone, but not Buddy Guy, who has always had the best smile in the blues business and a musical exuberance to match.</td>

      <td>Isabelle Huppert plays a drug-buster turned decked-out dealer in this comedic crime film from director Jean-Paul Salomé.</td>
      <td>If you’ll indulge my dropping one name in reference to another, François Truffaut once told me, not entirely in jest, that he thought the best way to get financing for his scripts might be to send them to Isabelle Huppert right off the bat, since the money men would want him to cast her in any case. That was back in the days when Ms. Huppert was starring in three, four, even five movies a year, and managing to be fascinating at a minimum in most of them. (She has 146 screen credits so far, none of them Truffaut films.) Now, in “Mama Weed,” a beguiling crime comedy in French with English subtitles, she is fascinating again, but in a wonderfully nimble way that could be considered campy if her style weren’t so assured and her performance weren’t so witty and precise. (The film can be seen via video on demand.)<br />Ms. Huppert is Patience Portefeux, a French-Arabic translator assigned to phone surveillance in a police narcotics unit in Paris. Patience works so hard that both of her teenage daughters worry about her. “It’s not work, it’s existential,” she insists. Freely translated, that means she can barely pay the rent, given her obligations as a single mom plus the cost of keeping her own borderline-dotty mother in a nursing home. (Madame Portefeux is played by Liliane Rovère.)<br />Still, Patience doesn’t lack resources. She learned valuable life lessons from her Algerian father, who rose from penniless immigrant to prosperous crook before dying, at age 34, in the course of eating a perfectly benign Caesar salad. Prompted by the kindness of her mother’s caregiver, a Moroccan woman named Kadidja (Farida Ouchani), Patience does what she can to protect Kadidja’s son, a young drug dealer she happens to be surveilling. Then she sees her main chance to acquire a small fortune in hashish and deal the stuff herself.<br />Coincidence propels the plot, which is full of holes and candidly amoral as well as somewhat quaint, considering Europe’s steady liberalization of marijuana laws. And concern for political correctness has troubled the filmmakers not a bit, since all of the drug dealers are Muslim and utter buffoons, members of rival gangs that can’t think straight. (Jean-Paul Salomé directed, from a script that he and his son, Antoine Salomé, adapted from a novel by Hannelore Cayre.) Be that as it may, the movie’s main and mesmerizing attraction is a character that Patience creates for herself, a narcotics queenpin called Mama Weed—that’s a clumsy translation of the original title, “La Daronne,” or “The Mum.” She is ostensibly Muslim, a mysterious and alluring creature who, wearing shades and a crossover hijab that Patience bought online, looks for all the world like a silent-film star, a Gloria Swanson of the Maghreb.<br />It’s a terrific performance in a film that swings gracefully between drama and kinetic farce. In the dramatic mode, Hippolyte Girardot is Philippe, Patience’s good-hearted boss and ardent lover. He has no idea, of course, that her alter ego is the mastermind he and his cops are trying to catch. Playing the dual roles clearly gave Ms. Huppert great pleasure, which she communicates with a delicate relish that turns piquant when Mama Weed shows her befuddled underlings who’s boss. A drug-ring dominatrix isn’t the film’s only felicitous invention. Nadja Nguyen is Colette Fo, Patience’s cheerfully larcenous landlady. And who knew about the existence, at least in this droll fiction, of an animal shelter for retired police dogs where the superannuated sniffers’ specific talents are listed for potential owners? In order to find the stash of hash that will transform her life, Patience rescues a drug-and-currency detector named DNA. He, like his new mistress, rises to the occasion with alacrity and purpose.</td>

      <td>A 21st-century term for manipulated audio or video updates a word used by 19th-century Australian convicts.</td>
      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />In the new documentary “Roadrunner” about the life of celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain, the filmmakers made a controversial choice. The director, Morgan Neville, commissioned a software company to re-create Bourdain’s voice digitally, synthesizing three lines of voice-over. The lines were statements that Bourdain wrote but never uttered before his death in 2018.<br />The artificial-intelligence technology used to craft the fictitious audio is called “deepfake,” and it has set off a debate online since food writer Helen Rosner published a piece in the New Yorker last week, “The Ethics of a Deepfake Anthony Bourdain Voice,” interviewing Mr. Neville about the decision.<br />While the audiovisual technology that allows this kind of trickery has long been in development, the word “deepfake” first emerged in late 2017. That was when someone on the online forum Reddit began posting manipulated celebrity videos under the name “deepfakes.” Soon there was a (now banned) Reddit community, r/deepfakes, devoted to sharing fake videos, which often consisted of face-swapping celebrities into pornographic clips.<br />Since then, deepfakes have grown more sophisticated, as it becomes easier to make it seem as if a person is saying or doing whatever the creator wants. The “deep” of “deepfake” refers to “deep learning,” an A.I. method that involves training a neural network to create fabrications based on existing recordings and images of a person.</td>

Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) introduced a bill Thursday that would strip online platforms such as  Facebook Inc.  and  Twitter Inc.  of their liability protections if their technologies spread misinformation related to public-health emergencies, such as the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />The bill, which Ms. Klobuchar previously telegraphed was in the works, would create an exception to the law known as Section 230, which shields internet platforms from lawsuits for content generated by their users and other third parties.<br />Should the bill become law—which is far from certain—the Health and Human Services Department would face the task of issuing guidance related to whether the internet posts at issue constitute health misinformation.<br />If HHS determines that they do, the platforms would be more vulnerable to litigation accusing them of spreading misinformation because they would no longer have the broad protections against liability for user-generated content under Section 230.<br />A court would still need to adjudicate any liability.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. military is preparing to house as many as 35,000 Afghan interpreters and family members at two American bases, in Kuwait and in Qatar, in an expanding effort to aid those who face Taliban retribution for helping American forces, U.S. officials said.<br />Plans are under way to build temporary housing and other facilities at Camp As Sayliyah in Qatar and Camp Buehring in Kuwait that would be designed to house the interpreters for at least 18 months. Thousands of welcome packages, containing health and comfort items and packaged military meals that don’t contain pork, to accommodate Muslim dietary requirements, are being positioned at the bases, officials said.<br />The plans are to accommodate the interpreters and their families as they await processing for American visas to be permanently resettled in the U.S. Construction and other preparations at the two bases are expected to cost the U.S. government several hundred million dollars, officials said.<br />The plans build on similar preparations elsewhere. A first group of about 2,500 Afghan interpreters and their families are expected to arrive at Fort Lee, Va. in coming days, officials said. Those people, who include 750 applicants and family members, will stay at Fort Lee for a week to 10 days before being resettled in the U.S. permanently, officials said.<br />Thousands of other interpreters and their families aren’t as far along in the Special Immigrant Visa application process, which can take several years to complete. As Taliban fighters make gains across Afghanistan, officials cite a growing need to evacuate those interpreters and their families from the country as soon as possible to protect them from potential retaliation.</td>

      <td>Statewide poll finds a tight contest; summer crises and a filing error could mean fewer votes for the incumbent.</td>
      <td>Tuesday’s column noted the remarkable phenomenon of some Democrats not identifying themselves as Democrats in promoting their congressional campaigns in the heartland. Now the trend has even been spotted on the left coast in deep-blue California. The problem for Gov. Gavin Newsom is that the absence of his party affiliation on the September recall ballot will be due to his lawyer’s paperwork error, not a political strategy. It could cost Mr. Newsom valuable votes in a race that is suddenly looking more competitive.<br />San Francisco’s KRON-TV reports:<br />The statewide poll of registered voters did find that 48% of respondents favor keeping Mr. Newsom as governor while 43% support recalling him and 9% are undecided. But there seems to be little appetite to let Mr. Newsom stay in office for long. KRON notes another question in the survey and the striking responses:<br />An incumbent can’t feel confident about an electorate saying it’s almost ready to fire him. Respondents give the governor poor marks on addressing wildfires and homelessness, and on another issue with enormous impact on the quality of life. Here’s the question and the answers that could spell more political trouble for the incumbent in September:<br />The governor may have also figured out that not everyone in the Golden State appreciates his penchant for exercising emergency authority to override individual liberty—or maybe he just doesn’t want to be accountable for the results.

      <td>State’s brief for coming high court case says landmark abortion decision violates Constitution’s provisions on states’ rights</td>
      <td>Mississippi asked the Supreme Court Thursday to abolish federal abortion rights, arguing in a brief that Roe v. Wade and other precedents entitling women to end their pregnancies in some circumstances trample on states’ 10th-Amendment powers to decide public policy within their borders.<br />In May, the Supreme Court agreed to hear Mississippi’s appeal of a 2019 appeals court decision striking down a state law prohibiting abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy. The case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, is to be argued after the court’s new term begins in October, with a decision expected by next summer.<br />The Mississippi case has been regarded as a bellwether for abortion rights, challenging precedents that set viability—the fetus’s ability to survive outside the womb—as the baseline for expanded government power to restrict the procedure. In its initial appeal, filed in June 2020, Mississippi argued its Gestational Age Act complied with existing precedent, suggesting that Roe be overruled only if the court found no other way to uphold the state law.<br />But the brief filed Thursday reframed the arguments, taking direct aim at the 1973 Roe decision and a 1992 follow-up, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, that narrowed Roe’s scope. Under current precedent, regulations that place an undue burden on women seeking abortion are unconstitutional.<br />“Roe and Casey are egregiously wrong. The conclusion that abortion is a constitutional right has no basis in text, structure, history, or tradition,” Mississippi argued. “Roe broke from prior cases, Casey failed to rehabilitate it, and both recognize a right that has no basis in the Constitution.”</td>

      <td>Coastal hamlets like Lewes and Rehoboth offer a host of sophisticated new attractions as more pandemic transplants look to host Zoom calls near the beach</td>
      <td>TRAVELERS in southern Delaware cruise down single-lane roads, passing farms that grow corn and raise chickens until they arrive at the coastal hamlets of Bethany, Fenwick Island, Lewes and Rehoboth. After my husband’s first job as a newly minted doctor brought us to Lewes two decades ago, a realtor warned us that “life is simple” in Sussex County. Indeed it was. Winters were long, with many restaurants and the seasonal amusement park Funland closed until tourists marched back in the summer. But steady residential growth, accelerated by pandemic transplants who want to hold Zoom calls at the beach, has made it more of a year-round destination. Drives along rural stretches these days are punctuated by new housing developments with lawns greener than the farms. As the site of President Biden’s summer home, Rehoboth—a longtime refuge for the LGBTQ community, D.C. politicos and retirees—has shined the national spotlight on the region.<br />With the houses have come more year-round restaurants, drinking establishments, and attractions beyond the boardwalk. Though my husband and I have since moved to Maryland, we make frequent trips to Lewes and each time we spot a new craft brewery or a farm-to-table restaurant, we shake our heads and joke, “Life is no longer simple.” Located 8 miles north of Rehoboth, Lewes draws families looking for a quieter, carnival-free beach experience, plus history and architecture buffs eager to explore the town’s antique shops and mishmash of 17th-century buildings. While the town’s quaint downtown remains its primary attraction, other noteworthy businesses have cropped up on the highways leading to it.<br />My husband and I imagine what our former realtor would make of the area’s newer businesses, like the 3-year-old Station on Kings in Lewes: a garden store, epicurean shop and cafe housed in a farmhouse-chic space. It’s down the street from Big Oyster Brewery, which was recently serving a seasonal coriander- and-orange-zest-infused Solar Power Belgian witbier and raw oysters from Delaware, Virginia and Connecticut. It’s one of several new spots where you can savor local brews and mid-Atlantic bivalves. The growing Revelation Craft Brewing serves IPAs, sours and lagers at its beer garden in Milton and indoor/outdoor space in Rehoboth. A Georgetown outpost is under construction.<br />While the beach towns have always attracted a steady stream of businesses and visitors, those one-lane towns you might pass on the way to the beach have mushroomed. Dagsboro, 23 miles southwest of Rehoboth, features an oasis of native grasses and seasonally changing flowers that back up to woodlands at the 2-year-old Delaware Botanic Gardens at Pepper Creek. Piet Oudolf, the landscape architect behind New York City’s High Line, designed the garden’s central meadow.<br />Fifteen miles north of Rehoboth in Milton, where fast-growing Dogfish Head Craft Brewery planted the state’s first production brewery in 1997, visitors could spend a few hours at two attractions that opened in the past decade. Sip Scandinavian-style honey wine at Brimming Horn Meadery, where a Viking on a wall display tells you to “Party like it’s 793.” Pick up floral-scented lotions, organic tea and herbes de Provence after roaming the gardens at the Lavender Fields at Warrington Manor.</td>

      <td>Limit will be reinstated next month, and the U.S. government may run out of money to pay bills this fall unless it is raised or suspended</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Top Senate Republicans said the GOP may line up against any effort to raise the government’s borrowing limit this year, adding to the uncertainty surrounding how Congress will address the issue after the limit is reinstated next month.<br />Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R., S.D.) said at a press conference Wednesday that Democratic plans to advance President Biden’s $4 trillion agenda could prompt Republicans to oppose a debt-limit increase, echoing comments Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) made earlier to the media outlet Punchbowl News.<br />“I don’t think there’s a single Republican senator who views increasing the debt limit so that Democrats can expand government and spend massive amounts as something they in the end would want to support,” Mr. Thune said.<br />The Republican comments drew criticism from Democrats, who cast them as a hypocritical ploy that could trouble financial markets. While debt has soared since the start of the pandemic, deficits were rising for several years before that, in part because of two bipartisan budget deals that lifted government spending, and the 2017 GOP tax cuts, which constrained federal revenue.<br />“We have Covid debt, we have Trump debt, we’ve got a double standard, and we want to make it clear nobody is going to hold the American economy hostage, period, full stop,” said Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) chairman of the Finance Committee.</td>

We need cooperation in the field of intelligence. We need help with training. We need troops to help us in the air.”<br />The statement is to be issued in connection with Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi’s visit to Washington on Monday, when he will meet with President Biden.<br />The purpose of the statement, current and former officials said, is to enable the Iraqi leader to blunt the political pressure from hard-line Shiite factions who want all of the approximately 2,500 American troops in the country to depart, while maintaining U.S. support for Iraqi security forces.<br />One U.S. official said that Washington plans to meet the terms of the statement mainly by redefining the role of some of the U.S. forces in the country instead of reducing the American presence.</td>

      <td>Historian Amanda Foreman searches the past for the origins of today’s world. Read previous columns here.<br />The human body runs on glucose, a type of sugar that travels through the bloodstream to the cells where it converts into energy. Some 34.2 million Americans are diabetic; their bodies are unable to produce the hormone insulin, which regulates how glucose is processed and stored in the cells. Without treatment the condition is terminal. The discovery of insulin a century ago this year was one of the great medical breakthroughs of the 20th century.<br />Diabetes was first recognized some 4,000 years ago. The Ebers Papryus, an Egyptian medical text written around 1550 B.C., refers to patients suffering from thirst, frequent urination and weight loss. An ancient Indian text, the Sushruta Samhita, composed after the 7th century B.C., advised testing for diabetes by seeing whether ants were attracted to the sugar in the urine.<br />The disproportionate amount of urine experienced by sufferers is probably the reason why the ancient Greeks called it “diabetes,” the word for “siphon” or “to pass through.” They also made the link to lifestyle: The 5th century B.C. physician Hippocrates, the “father of medicine,” advocated exercise as part of the treatment.<br />Early on, the Chinese recognized that an unbalanced diet of sweet, rich and fatty foods could play a role. Lady Dai, a minor aristocrat who died in the 2nd century B.C., was a textbook case. Her perfectly preserved mummy, discovered in southern China in 1971, revealed a life of dietary excess. She also suffered the consequences: osteoarthritis, high cholesterol, hypertension, liver disease, gall stones and, crucially, diabetes.</td>

Both men hope their feats will help usher in a new era in which ordinary people can enjoy the wonders of spaceflight. Elon Musk’s SpaceX is planning a civilian launch later this year. “Welcome to the dawn of a new space age,” Mr. Branson announced after he landed.<br />The intrepid astro-billionaires admit there are risks involved, but they don’t dwell on them. So far only Mr. Musk, whose company is widely admired by NASA insiders, has emphasized the risks. Speaking of his plans to send crews to Mars before the end of the decade, he said, “a bunch of people will probably die in the beginning.” Mr. Musk is right. Space travel is dangerous, and a question worth asking is: How many will die?<br />The last time there was talk about sending an ordinary person into space, NASA was doing the talking. In 1985 Christa McAuliffe beat out more than 11,000 other applicants to win a seat on the space shuttle Challenger. Almost overnight, she became a national celebrity: America’s teacher in space.<br />NASA had a journalist-in-space program ready to go, with applicants including Walter Cronkite and Norman Mailer. “They are probably taking a journalist on the principle that Earth could not but be improved having one fewer on it,” George Willquipped at the time.<br />When reporters asked McAuliffe whether she was nervous about rocketing into orbit, she repeated what she had been told: that the shuttle was as safe as a passenger jet. In fact, like today’s Blue Origin, SpaceX, and Virgin Galactic vehicles, the space shuttle was an engineering experiment in progress.</td>

Mr. Bach asked the athletes to imagine that millions of fans across the globe were cheering them on. Japan Olympic soccer team captain Maya Yoshida wrote a letter to Mr. Bach, saying that he would much rather have live fans.<br />Since Tokyo was chosen as the host in 2013, I have been looking forward to putting my Japanese to use, flitting from Olympic event to event like a knowing native. For an accredited journalist, nothing beats the Olympics. In its current police-state iteration, these Olympics could only be expected in China.<br />The Tokyo Olympic fiasco didn’t start with the coronavirus pandemic. When Tokyo was elevated from candidate city to host, the two bid architects, Japan Olympic Committee President Tsunekazu Takeda and Masato Mizuno, chairman of the global Mizuno Sports Equipment Co., were jettisoned for political reasons. Their replacements, politicians Yoshiro Mori and Toshiro Muto, were neither sportsmen nor businessmen. So when the pandemic forced a one-year postponement of Tokyo 2020, there was no one capable of gathering the reins and salvaging the Olympics.<br />While Israel was buying up enough vaccines to return to normalcy, Tokyo 2020, in step with the International Olympic Committee and fighting to preserve its brand, was instead concocting a series of “Playbooks” whose goal was to protect unvaccinated Japanese from foreign Olympic participants, most of whom would be vaccinated.

      <td>No two airlines are the same: Each operates in a different market with different business models that have been differently affected by the pandemic. But you wouldn’t know that by looking at the stock market.<br />When the Covid-19 crisis first rocked the world in early 2020, investors were quick to figure out that low-cost airlines would do better than full-service players. The latter are dependent on carefully designed networks that are profitable because corporate and long-haul travellers pay a premium to fly. Balance sheets also took center stage: Carriers with large debts, like American Airlines, were punished the worst, whereas healthier budget players were seen as gaining market share once travel recovered.<br />Recently, though, the shares of U.S. airlines have followed the same trajectory. Budget and legacy airlines alike have lost about 15% of their value since the end of May, even as travelers have returned to airports and the broader S&P 500 has gained almost 4%. The selloff itself isn’t necessarily odd, because the spread of the Delta variant has eroded recovery hopes. What doesn’t make sense is that all types of carriers are considered to be equally affected.<br />Vaccines have reduced the likelihood of strict lockdowns in the U.S., and thus the threat for domestically focused low-cost airlines like  Southwest Airlines ,   Frontier Airlines  and  Spirit Airlines .  The real impact of Covid-19 variants so far has been keeping trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific routes shut, which is a blow to the network carriers, particularly United Airlines and  Delta Air Lines .<br />Low-cost carriers have long traded at a stock-market premium relative to earnings, but the gap has actually shrunk during the pandemic. That is even true when using profit forecasts for 2023, when the whole aviation market is expected to have recovered.</td>

He pointed to ViacomCBS’s decision to sell CNET to Red Ventures LLC in 2020 and  AT&T Inc.’s  move earlier this year to spin out its DirecTV business.<br />“All of these companies grew a lot through M&A, and they’re diversified,” Mr. Ianniello said. “A lot of these companies are going to shed assets for them to focus.” Other potential acquisition targets could be in the telecommunications or technology sectors, Mr. Ianniello said.<br />Mr. Ianniello has named his firm Argus, a reference to the many-eyed giant of Greek mythology and to Mr. Ianniello’s two-decade career at CBS, known for its iconic eye-shaped logo.

      <td>If the 2020s are going to roar as stylishly as the 1920s, we need furniture dedicated to hooch. “People are looking for ways to entertain at home gracefully,” said Laura Neuman, the principal of PepperJack Interiors in Loomis, Calif., who has installed bar cabinets as affordable alternatives to built-in bars. Adding the latter to your home involves the services of so many tradespeople—tile mason, plumber, cabinet maker—that it can become a demanding (and expensive) project, she said.<br />We’ve scouted out five new liquor lockers that can handsomely stand in for a home bar. But before you impulse-buy any of them, make sure the one you choose plays amiably with the rest of your decor, suggested Jessica Harris, manager of production design for national furniture retailer Living Spaces. “A cabinet with tapered legs or one made from Lucite or wood and brass would suit a room with mid-century stylings,” she said. “A glam living room might call for a sleek cabinet with gold accents.”<br />When it comes to barware, Ms. Neuman recommends sticking with neutrals: stainless steel, crystal, brass. “The colors of wine and liquor bottles are so pretty, I wouldn’t add more.” She would, however, suggest riffing on the flavor of a cabinet. For the geometric Rosetta piece below, for example, she would pull in  Bauhaus  reproductions from a museum store. To complement the curvy, patinated Amalfi Chest, she’d look for daintier glassware like etched crystal—more artisanal Anthropologie than preppy Ralph Lauren. With the Classic Line Bar Cabinet by Muller, which looks like a big red toolbox, she’d have fun with an industrial theme, maybe even subbing in pickle jars “like the ones guys store nails and screws in” for glasses.<br />Here, the five chests we’d love to use to mix up our post-lockdown cocktails.<br />In this Japandi—Japanese meets Scandinavian—design, the pronounced oak grain makes a right turn when it hits the cabinet’s oversize pulls. Open shelves offer lots of storage. Vertex Bookcase Bar, $1,200, crateandbarrel.com</td>

      <td>A criminologist argues that last year’s unprecedented rise in killings was the result of treating policing as a problem to be solved, rather than an essential part of public order.</td>
      <td>The rise in murders in the U.S. in 2020 was unprecedented. Complete nationwide data for the year won’t be available until September, but we already know that in 70 cities and counties that account for a fifth of the U.S. population, the murder rate rose by 35%. The largest previous increase on record was 13% in 1968—a year that, like 2020, was marked by civil unrest, often triggered by police misconduct, leading to demands for police reform.<br />In the years before 2020, the murder rate had begun to edge up after a two-decade decline that reached a historic low in 2014. Even so, it rose just 15% in the next five years combined.<br />Why was 2020 so dramatically different? Some analysts have pointed to the extraordinary circumstances of the year: the stress of Covid-19 and its lockdowns; the plunging economy and spiking unemployment; a virtual standstill in criminal prosecution; the turmoil in city after city following the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. Some of these factors mattered less than is commonly thought, but others mattered a great deal, especially in their combined impact on policing.<br />Murder in America remains a relatively rare event, far below its 1991 peak. In 2020, one was far less likely to be murdered in the U.S. than to die from Covid-19, a drug overdose, a car crash or suicide. In many neighborhoods, murder is almost unheard of. But where it happens regularly, it has a powerful and destructive impact. The residents of such neighborhoods are often poor and disproportionately Black and Hispanic. Over half of all murder victims in America are Black, though Black Americans make up just 12.5% of the population.<br />No single cause can explain the spike in murder in 2020. Like politics, crime is local, and violent crime is often hyperlocal, but we can see some clear patterns among the most troubled cities.</td>

Milton and Rose Friedman presented the shocking numbers in “Free To Choose”: Out of some 89,000 applications for certificates, the Interstate Commerce Commission approved about 27,000. That number fell to 25,000 by 1939 and 14,648 by 1974. Meanwhile, tons shipped by regulated trucks in intercity service increased from 25.5 million in 1938 to 698.1 million in 1972, a 27-fold increase.

      <td>We consulted stylists and did our own test to see whether the pricey Dyson Airwrap hair styler deserves its status as a social media sensation.</td>
      <td>IF BLOW DRYING and then straightening your uncooperative hair has long been your least-favorite part of your beauty routine, you might especially dread the chore during the summer. That’s when styling tools can heat up an already hot bathroom and leave your hair feeling extra-dry.<br />So when our social media feeds started lighting up with videos of a tool that promises to solve these common hair-care woes—drying, styling and straightening at once—our curiosity was piqued. The influencers promoting the futuristic-looking, $550 Dyson Airwrap say it styles their locks more quickly and yields more-polished results than the old-school tools most of us rely on. But given the frequently sold-out gadget’s staggering price and a potentially long wait for delivery, buying one requires conviction. Would your styling time be significantly more pleasant—and the results better—if you splurged? We consulted stylists and did our own test to answer a few key questions.<br />According to Dyson scientists and pro stylists, what sets the Airwrap apart is that it uses less heat than competing tools. It harnesses a fluid dynamic principle called the Coanda effect (where a high-speed vortex of air flows across a surface) promising to dry and style hair simultaneously without extreme heat. What most convinced Travis Ryan Smith, a hairstylist in San Francisco and Manteca, Calif., is how the tool guards against extreme heat damage while giving users the ability to achieve salon-quality results in-between visits. “Dyson has figured out how to get that wind-power [while] not burning or fraying the hair,” he said. The Airwrap also comes with eight attachments, including barrels to curl or wave and brushes to smooth or volumize.<br />Although Stephen Marinaro, creator of TheSalonGuy with over 874,000 followers on YouTube, often opts for Dyson products, he found the Airwrap had its limitations. “It can’t replace a traditional round brush [plus] a blow dryer,” he said.<br />With hundreds of thousands of posts tagged #airwrap on social media, the Dyson is among the most talked-about tools on the hair styling market. Sophia Ganguzza, a registered nurse, bought an Airwrap six months ago to practice self care during a challenging pandemic year. “Wearing my hair straight gives me such a boost of confidence and I was ready to take back that control,” said the 28-year-old.</td>

The cartoons simplified “political issues that kids wouldn’t comprehend and beautifies criminal activities,” Superintendent Steve Li Kwai-wah told a news conference. “They’re meant to poison the minds of children,” he said.<br />Described as teaching aids, the books were distributed through pro-democracy businesses, local political offices and online by the speech therapists’ union, which was founded in November 2019—a time when some activists formed workers’ groups as a way to organize protest actions against the government.<br />The books include one titled “The Guardians of Sheep Village,” which is set against the backdrop of antigovernment protests that rocked Hong Kong in 2019. It depicts a malicious plot by the wolves to take over the sheep’s village and devour them all.<br />Another, “12 Warriors of Sheep Village,” refers to a dozen activists who were caught by the Chinese coast guard during an ill-fated boat escape from Hong Kong last year. The third book in the series, titled “Street Cleaners of Sheep Village,” alludes to a medical workers’ strike last year when Hong Kong faced its first coronavirus infections imported from China, using cartoons of littering wolves to portray outsiders.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) is pitching fellow Republican senators on a last-ditch gambit to block Democrats’ $3.5 trillion budget resolution: Skip town.<br />Mr. Graham believes a united Republican caucus can deny Democrats the 51 votes needed for quorum by leaving the capital en masse, citing the example of Texas Democrats, who fled their state to prevent the GOP-controlled legislature from enacting stricter voting laws. He said he is driven by his opposition to immigration provisions that Democrats might include in their resolution.<br />“If they put in amnesty in…that’s an assault on the system as we know it,” Mr. Graham said. “We should use any tool in our box to stop it.”<br />The Democrats’ plan is expected to set aside $120 billion for establishing a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers—immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children—as well as other groups that could include farmworkers, according to Senate aides.<br />Some GOP senators are open to the quorum-busting idea, but others are skeptical, leaving Mr. Graham with a lot of convincing to do. When senators tried a similar trick decades ago, Capitol Police physically carried one of the fugitive lawmakers back onto the floor. Senate Democrats scoff at the threat.</td>

      <td>A tech-world striver finds her careful path toward the American dream has taken an unexpected turn.</td>
      <td>The narrator of YZ Chin’s novel “Edge Case” (Ecco, 304 pages, $26.99) trusts us completely, even though we’ve just met, and online at that. “I know I can really talk to you because you’re a therapist,” she begins. “You’ll keep everything I tell you confidential, I’m sure. Yes, I know, you’ve said. You’re not a therapist yet. But as far as I’m concerned, it’s close enough.” Readers may be reminded of a very different narrative, Mohsin Hamid’s “The Reluctant Fundamentalist,” which begins: “Excuse me, sir, but may I be of assistance? Ah, I see I have alarmed you. Do not be frightened by my beard: I am a lover of America.” In each case, we are swiftly drawn in and held fast by a stranger’s voice, as intimate as it is insistent. There is no menace, however, in the approach made by Ms. Chin’s heroine—rather, she comes to us with a disarming frankness. Within a few sentences, she seizes not only our attention but also our affection, which only grows as we follow her deceptively simple story of love mislaid on the alien terrain of the United States.<br />“I’d arrived in the fall of 2008 with what Americans called ‘an accent,’ ” Edwina explains of her migration, as an eager college student, from Malaysia to Manhattan. She has trouble being understood, her politeness only adding to the confusion, until (at her bossy mother’s distant urging) she begins to watch late-night TV and sees that, “for Americans, making others laugh was itself a kind of elegance.” That’s why men in expensive suits were paid to do it. Armed with a degree in literature and classes in computer programming, Edwina resolves, therefore, to master humor while searching for the tech job that might secure her a green card. AInstein, a startup developing a robot that can intelligently tell jokes, seems ideal (the whimsical AI theme is thankfully underplayed), and Edwina becomes the company’s only female employee.<br />As such, she is tasked with catching early mistakes made by computer engineers who refer to her simply as “tester.” “It always made me think of the sad labeled tubes of lipstick at Sephora,” she admits, “mauve heads battered and ready to transmit oral herpes.” This diligent student, it turns out, never needed any humor lessons. Indeed, Edwina’s wry outlook on her adopted country and her fellow expatriates is one of the novel’s chief delights. Summing up, for example, the complexities of Chinese/Malaysian identity, she observes that “we all identified . . . with the aesthetics of being Chinese. We wanted the five-thousand-plus years of culture, the history of world-changing inventions, and the somber respect due a sophisticated ancient civilization, but we disavowed the clichés of squatting on toilet seats or spitting on sidewalks, not to mention the Communist Party.”<br />Outwardly dull and ever watchful, Edwina is that irresistible protagonist, the overlooked woman on whom nothing is lost, though when “Edge Case” opens she is indeed baffled. Her husband, Marlin, grown increasingly preoccupied and distant, has simply vanished, a discovery Edwina makes upon returning from work one day. “My heart responded first,” she reports. “By the time I remembered that a suitcase used to stand where the clean square was, my chest was growing hot from racing, tripping beats.” Over the next 18 days, while still following her daily routine, Edwina searches for her husband, visiting his familiar haunts and even to a mysterious house in upstate New York where Marlin, she learns, has become an initiate of the Dowsers Society of America: “Someone who used a necklace as a telephone to the spirit world,” as she dryly puts it.<br />There is, however, no spiritual, let alone criminal, mystery here, although Edwina’s quest and the novel’s periodic flashbacks do create a satisfying atmosphere of suspense. What interests Ms. Chin—and what she so skillfully dramatizes—is rather the eternal conundrum of being a human among other humans (“Maybe you don’t actually know me that well,” is Martin’s  remark that hurts Edwina most of all) and, more specifically, of being an immigrant at the mercy of a volatile host. Similar preoccupations connect the short stories in her 2018 volume “Though I Get Home” (Feminist Press, 216 pages, $16.95), which range from British-ruled Malaysia to high-tech Manhattan, from family reminiscences to political terror.</td>

      <td>Variant might not have the same impact as previous surges, but spotty rates of vaccination mean it could slow growth</td>
      <td>The Delta variant of the coronavirus probably won’t derail the U.S. economy. That doesn’t mean it can’t damage parts of it.<br />For a while, America’s progress against the Covid-19 pandemic looked very good. Millions of people were getting vaccinated each day, Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths were falling, and a return to something like normal beckoned. But then the vaccine rollout slowed markedly just as the far more contagious Delta variant took hold. Cases, hospitalizations and deaths have begun to rise.<br />It is tempting to imagine the Delta variant won’t dent the economy at all.<br />Across the board, state and local officials seem far less apt to dial up restrictions in response to rising Covid-19 cases than they were a year ago, while the places with low vaccine uptake also happen to be the places that are most resistant to restrictions. Moreover, many people are vaccinated—particularly the elderly—and with the apparent efficacy of current vaccines against the Delta variant, the U.S. seems unlikely to revisit the staggering mortality statistics of the sort it experienced before vaccines became widely available. Finally, the savings many Americans built up over the past year left them with ample money to throw around, while businesses’ scramble for workers points to a labor market that should keep generating income gains.<br />Those are all things that should ensure the economy continues to grow, but it probably won’t grow as swiftly as it otherwise could have. Worries about the Delta variant will lead some people to refrain from entering crowded settings, such as restaurants or airplanes, while also making them more cautious about spending down any savings. Some companies will delay their return to the office, as Apple just did, and that will hurt downtown restaurants and the like that depend on office workers’ business.</td>

      <td>The emerging U.S. approach to China will get a test during the first high-level face-to-face exchange in months</td>
      <td>The Biden administration is raising the pressure on China, confronting it on cyberattacks and human rights and making tentative progress rallying allies to its side, while so far avoiding deep engagement with Beijing.<br />The emerging Biden policy will get a test this weekend when the State Department’s No. 2 official, Wendy Sherman, travels to China for the first face-to-face meeting of senior officials in more than three months. The discussions, the department said Wednesday, will center on U.S. concerns and areas of possible alignment.<br />The U.S. has in recent weeks begun to accelerate moves to pressure China. It issued twin advisories to American businesses about the reputational, legal and other risks of operating in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, regions where Beijing is tightening its grip with crackdowns. This week it publicly called out China’s chief intelligence service for sponsoring hacking around the world—and got dozens of allies to join it in the condemnation.<br />Six months after taking office—and amid continuing internal deliberations—the Biden approach to China is taking shape. Officials are pressing ahead with the Trump administration’s tougher line on Beijing, while bringing allies on board on more issues to increase leverage, administration officials said.<br />“What gets Beijing’s attention the most is not just when it’s the United States doing something, but when it’s the United States rallying our allies and partners to do something together,” said an official.</td>

      <td>The grocery delivery company says it plans to build and operate fulfillment centers for supermarkets</td>
      <td>Instacart Inc. is entering the warehouse business, seeking to expand its reach in an increasingly competitive food delivery market.<br />The grocery delivery company said it would start building fulfillment centers for supermarkets over the next 12 months, in partnership with technology company Fabric, in or near grocery stores, with capacity for 10,000 to 50,000 items.<br />In such fulfillment centers, the company will use robots to pull items from warehouses and have Instacart’s workers pack and deliver orders. Instacart currently deploys shoppers who grab products from grocery stores and drop them off at people’s homes. The company didn’t say how many centers it will build, where they will be or how much it will invest.<br />Warehouses, which will be automated, are expected to speed up the delivery process, the company said.  Albertsons  Cos.,  SpartanNash Co.  and other grocers are also building small warehouses for online orders.<br />San Francisco-based Instacart has grown sharply during the pandemic, as more consumers shifted their shopping online. It is facing new challenges as businesses reopen; online grocery sales are slowing and shoppers are returning to in-person shopping. Delivery companies are still struggling to turn a profit, as labor and transportation costs eat into profit margins. Many grocers remain worried that they are sharing customers and earnings with Instacart––which takes a commission cut for each order––and say they have more options as delivery companies pitch favorable deals to stand out.</td>

      <td>FRANKFURT—The European Central Bank signaled that it would support the eurozone economy by keeping interest rates low for longer as a surge in Covid-19 cases driven by the highly contagious Delta variant triggers new social restrictions and weighs on the region’s large tourism industry.<br />The ECB’s move is in part a response to its new policy framework, unveiled two weeks ago, which aims to give bank officials broader powers to stimulate the economy when inflation is too low.<br />The central bank said in a statement that it won’t increase its key interest rate, currently set at minus 0.5%, until inflation moves much closer to its target of 2% and looks likely to remain at that level. “This may also imply a transitory period in which inflation is moderately above target,” the bank said. The ECB had previously given a looser commitment to hold interest rates until inflation looked likely to hit its target within a few years.<br />While a surge in prices has stirred fears the U.S. is entering an inflationary period, the eurozone has long been mired in low inflation, despite years of ultra loose monetary policy.<br />The ECB also reiterated its pledge to buy eurozone debt under an emergency €1.85 trillion bond-buying program, equivalent to $2.2 trillion, through at least March 2022.</td>

Those are the headlines connected to this year’s Olympic opening ceremony, normally an uplifting pageant of nations.<br />A day before the Tokyo Summer Games formally begin, Kentaro Kobayashi, who was to oversee performances at the opening ceremony, was ousted because of a comedy skit he performed in the 1990s about the Holocaust.<br />Mr. Kobayashi is the third senior member of the creative team for Olympic ceremonies to leave amid controversy.<br />Earlier this week, the musical director of the opening ceremony resigned after a magazine interview resurfaced in which he admitted bullying classmates as a student. The lead creative director of the opening and closing ceremonies resigned in March after floating an idea to put a female celebrity in a pig costume.<br />Already an exercise in crisis management because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Games faced another headache with just hours to go until the opening ceremony. After a review, Seiko Hashimoto, the head of the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee, said Thursday night that the ceremony wouldn’t be changed because no single part was directed solely by Mr. Kobayashi. Ceremonies at the Games were already scaled back to reduce costs after the pandemic forced the Olympics to be delayed by a year.</td>

The company expects to reduce output at its 10 operating mills there by a total of about 115 million board feet during the quarter.<br />That is only a sliver of North America’s overall supply. Yet analysts said they expected further curtailments because of fires that are scorching logging forests on both sides of the U.S.-Canadian border. In addition, lumber prices  have fallen below the cost of sawing boards in the continent’s most expensive place to process timber.<br />“The wildfires burning in western Canada are significantly impacting the supply chain and our ability to transport product to market,” said Stephen Mackie, executive vice president of Canfor’s North American operations.</td>

      <td>TAIPEI—China rejects the World Health Organization’s proposal for a second phase of investigation into Covid-19’s origins, including a potential laboratory leak, and has put forward its own proposal to seek evidence in other countries, a top Chinese official said.<br />WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus presented member states last week with a plan for further study that would include audits of laboratories and markets in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the first cases were identified. He also called for greater transparency from Beijing.<br />“We cannot accept this kind of plan for origin-tracing,” Zeng Yixin, vice minister of China’s National Health Commission, told a news conference Thursday.<br />Mr. Zeng said he was shocked by the proposal, adding that aspects of it “did not respect common sense and violated science.” Instead, he said Beijing had on July 4 submitted to the WHO its own proposal for a second phase, which he said should be based on the first phase that was conducted by a WHO-led team and their Chinese counterparts early this year.<br />China’s rejection of the WHO’s proposal presents a stumbling block in a painstaking global effort to find the origin of Covid-19, which has caused more than four million deaths around the world. Beijing is sensitive to other countries blaming it for the pandemic, and rising mistrust between the U.S. and China has compounded the difficulty of scientific collaboration and consensus.</td>

That is an intentional choice to avoid additional borrowing or scaling back their agenda. Republicans have also insisted that any bipartisan infrastructure deal be paid for.<br />Instead of borrowing at historically low interest rates, as was the case in the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief law in March, lawmakers appear set to open a well-worn bag of maneuvers, which analysts in both parties call gimmicks, to help claim their policies aren’t adding to the national debt, though Democrats will certainly have tax increases to point to.<br />Some techniques exploit gaps and quirks in how nonpartisan analysts at the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation measure the effects of policies. Others are designed to supplement official analyses with claims about savings or revenue that don’t meet those offices’ criteria.<br />Gordon Gray, director of fiscal policy at the conservative-leaning American Action Forum, said he takes public discussion of flimsy proposals as a sign that a deal is near as both parties try to make the numbers work.</td>

Combined fund appreciation across its various business lines was the highest in the history of the firm.<br />Aiding the strong performance was Blackstone’s recent emphasis on putting money into fast-growing companies. Initial public offerings of outsourcing company  TaskUs Inc.  and Indian electric-vehicle components manufacturer  Sona BLW Precision Forgings Ltd.  pushed up the firm’s private-equity portfolio, while sales of last-mile logistics properties in the U.S. and Australia helped boost its real-estate holdings.<br />Blackstone President Jonathan Gray has encouraged the firm’s business heads to think more thematically about investing, identifying global trends and finding ways to put money to work in areas that would benefit from them. Among these are logistics, software, digital payments and life sciences, areas of the economy that are experiencing outsize growth.</td>

      <td>St. Regis, the latest structure by Windy City architect Jeanne Gang, is a mixed-use tower that undulates as it rises and is the tallest building designed by a woman</td>
      <td>Chicago<br />Do not confuse the shape of a fashionable residential tower with the artistic line drawn by an architect. It is the line of truce after a battle. A developer fights to expand his territory, his holy volume of rentable space, and the architect pushes back, trying to carve and sculpt that volume, and to make it beautiful. The developer wins, of course, giving us the box with an all-glass skin that is the industry standard of high-rise housing.<br />But there are exceptions. The three interlocking and progressively taller towers that make up the St. Regis Chicago, this city’s newest and most prominent residential and hotel development, are as exquisitely contoured as a work of abstract sculpture. Each successive level is set back five inches and then, once 12 stories are reached, the process is reversed and the levels start to step outward. These 12-story modules have the shape of a decapitated pyramid--the technical term is “frustum”—and in their alternating inward and outward taper the towers call to mind Brancusi’s celebrated Endless Column. Yet for all their slenderness they manage to accommodate a daunting 1.9 million square feet, a colossal amount of residential and hotel space, in the most elegant fashion imaginable.<br />The St. Regis Chicago (which began life on the drawing board in 2014 as the Wanda Vista Tower) was meant to open last year, but after the inevitable delays it is opening only now. The 393 condominiums on the upper levels are partially occupied while its 191-room hotel and restaurant are still under construction. Nonetheless, it is sufficiently complete to take its measure. Prominently sited on the Chicago River, just east of Lake Michigan, it rises a full 101 stories, making it the city’s third-tallest building. It is easily the most important addition to the Chicago skyline in a generation—no small feat in America’s most celebrated architectural city.<br />The building is the work of Studio Gang, the Chicago firm with a knack for drawing aesthetic lessons from purely technical considerations. For nearly a decade it has been experimenting with “solar carving,” its term for the shaping of a building in accordance with the moving path of the sun. With the St. Regis, the calculations were unusually complex. As its girth varies, so does the relative amount of sunlight it receives, the heat gain rising as the footprint shrinks. To offset the difference, the architects hit upon the idea of progressively tinting the glass so that each floor receives the exact same quantity of sunlight and heat.</td>

After being grounded for over a year, even seasoned travelers admit to struggling with what was once a reflexive habit. “I forgot how to pack!” said Dallas-based U Beauty founder Tina Chen Craig who, pre-Covid, would typically travel every two weeks. “I had to keep reminding myself, ‘Ok, what do I normally do?’”<br />Complicating matters is the fact that many women’s dressing habits have changed since most of the world locked down in 2020. “I’ve always been fashion-forward, but since the pandemic, now I want to be seen,” said Jessica Nabongo, a Detroit-based travel influencer who set out to be the first Black woman to visit every country in the world. For Ms. Nabongo that means making her usual jet-setter wardrobe of cultish Nike FF720 trainers and jumpsuits more exuberant with colorful caftans, distinctive printed dresses, and no outfit repeats. “I never wear the same thing twice,” she said.<br />Whether you’re headed to the uneventful countryside or planning an intense tropical holiday, your packing process needn’t be an occasion to over-think. Below, four fashionable globe-trotters recall the most useful items they brought on recent trips to very different destinations. Plus, the regrettable pieces they should have left behind.<br />Planning a bucolic escape? Then practical footwear and bug spray are musts, said celebrity stylist Micaela Erlanger. Based between New York and Miami, Ms. Erlanger, 36, keeps her casual wardrobe reliably chic when visiting her fiancé’s family’s upstate New York farmhouse. Among her sensible staples: a vintage Gap jean jacket, breezy Zimmermann sundresses and Madewell jeans. She admits the bejeweled sandals she brought on a recent jaunt were impractical, and currently favors comfy flats like Birkenstocks. Other mainstays include her fragrant Coqui Coqui insect repellent and Ziploc accessory bags, ideal for costume jewelry.<br />If heading to a desert art mecca, follow Harsha L’Acqua’s lead and pack classic, slightly eccentric go-tos. As the founder of Saira Hospitality, the constantly traveling Ms. L’Acqua has earned pro-packer status. For a recent trip to Marfa, Texas, Ms. L’Acqua, 38, relied on timeless accessories like a sun-shielding cowboy hat and cream Converse high-tops, which she elevated with long dresses and bright caftans. Too frivolous for the desert town? The multiple bikinis Ms. L’Acqua impulsively brought. Meanwhile, a printed kimono, which “might seem luxurious,” proved practical, doubling as an elegant morning dressing gown and a chic evening layering piece.</td>

Some mentioned suicide. Couples who rarely argued were yelling at each other.<br />When the church resumed in-person services June 13, a new tension emerged: surprisingly angry reactions from some members to any pandemic-related safeguards that remained in place. Other clergy he talked to have seen similar levels of acrimony.<br />About one in four people with mental-health concerns turn to a clergy member before seeking help from clinical professionals, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, giving faith leaders a unique window on the mental health of many Americans.<br />Priests, pastors, rabbis, imams and deacons have witnessed waves of anxiety, depression, fear and grief. People who never sought help before reached out needing more than spiritual support and pastoral care. In response, some churches created mental-health ministries, hired clinical social workers and held town halls staffed by professionals.</td>

      <td>Bitcoin’s steep selloff is undercutting the argument made by the digital currency’s proponents that it’s an inflation hedge.<br />The original cryptocurrency has lost about half of its value since mid-April, fizzling after a spectacular rally that saw it surge above $60,000 from around $7,000 at the start of 2020. It traded Wednesday afternoon at $31,864, and got a small boost after Tesla Inc. boss Elon Musk said he has personal holdings of the cryptocurrency, as does his space company SpaceX.<br />The timing is ironic.<br />Bitcoin’s supporters for years have touted it as an inflation hedge like gold, mainly because the bitcoin network has a set limit on the number of units that can be created: 21 million. Their argument hadn’t previously been tested, however, because inflation has largely been under the Federal Reserve’s 2% target since bitcoin’s 2009 launch.<br />Now for the first time in years, shortages of semiconductors, lumber and workers are putting pressure on consumer prices, sparking worries about inflation. At the same time, governments and central banks have been forced to spend trillions to prop up their economies, potentially sapping the purchasing power of their currencies.</td>

      <td>DEL RIO, Texas—Texas has begun arresting and jailing migrants for trespassing, as Gov. Greg Abbott pursues a new plan aimed at illegal border crossers that is dividing counties in the state.<br />The first three migrants were sent to a state prison Tuesday on the state charges, according to Val Verde County Judge Lewis Owens, whose role is an elected executive akin to a mayor. Hundreds of law-enforcement officers from across the state and country have been sent to the Texas-Mexico border in recent weeks to begin arrests. Civil-rights groups have questioned the move, saying that states cannot legally enforce federal immigration law.<br />The move comes amid a historic upswing in illegal crossings along some stretches of the border, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Mr. Abbott, a Republican, last month declared the state’s border situation a disaster, a classification typically used for events such as hurricanes. He said state troopers in Texas would begin arresting immigrants for trespassing, a new approach in responding to increased border traffic. Immigration enforcement is normally left to the federal government.<br />Texas counties are divided over whether to accept the disaster designation and state troopers. So far, counties with the most illegal traffic have declined to participate in the state’s plans. Scores of state troopers have instead been dispatched into smaller communities upriver on the Rio Grande, along quieter stretches of the border.<br />“We concluded we could not in good faith tell the people of our counties there is an emergency when there’s not an emergency,” said Richard Cortez, county judge of the Rio Grande Valley’s Hidalgo County, whose role includes authority over disaster response.</td>

He said that some employers, such as resorts and hotels, may lose workers to other growing industries as job openings trend at record highs.<br />U.S. employers added 850,000 jobs in June, the largest gain in 10 months, and workers wages rose briskly, more signs of a strengthening labor market. Economists surveyed in July expected employers to add an average of nearly 500,000 jobs a month over the next year, which would be a historically fast pace of employment gains.</td>

Some 215,000 hectares of crops (about 531,000 acres) have been hit and economic losses so far were estimated at 1.22 billion yuan, the equivalent of $188.6 million, Xinhua said.<br />Henan’s meteorological agency forecast significant rainfall, including heavy rain and thunderstorms, through Thursday over large parts of the province and its capital of Zhengzhou.<br />One of China’s most populous and poorest provinces, Henan is home to more than 99 million residents and an economy reliant on agriculture and industry. Local authorities say the extreme rainfall that has battered the region since last week is unusually severe and may have been exacerbated by a typhoon approaching China’s eastern coastline.</td>

But Mr. Trump’s repeated public comments and criticism about pending criminal investigations and cases involving his allies—some of which the Justice Department appeared to heed—led Joe Biden to stress restoring independence to the department in his successful campaign for the presidency.<br />A national-security official during the Trump administration, for example, said White House lawyers were involved to an unusual degree in the 2020 process to review a manuscript from Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, who became a Trump critic. The official said the lawyers withheld information and conducted a flawed second review in what she said appeared to be an effort to justify a Justice Department lawsuit against Mr. Bolton.

      <td>On Nord Stream and Chinese hacking, a message of weakness.</td>
      <td>A troubling pattern is emerging in President Biden’s foreign policy: Officials talk tough—then follow up with diplomacy that amounts to little. Two examples this week—on Chinese hacking and Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline—underscore the point.<br />Barack Obama and Donald Trump opposed the $11 billion Nord Stream pipeline, which could double the amount of natural gas exported directly to Germany from Russia. But the Biden Administration has now blessed the project’s completion, handing Vladimir Putin a major strategic victory at the expense of Ukraine and Europe’s energy independence.<br />The White House says the pipeline was inevitable and improving America’s relationship with the Germans should come first. But the deal with Germany is embarrassing in its weakness. In a joint U.S.-German statement on Wednesday, Berlin pledges to impose sanctions in the future “should Russia attempt to use energy as a weapon or commit further aggressive acts against Ukraine.” We can hear them laughing in the Kremlin at that one.<br />The deal won’t go down well in Kyiv, which is struggling against Russian assaults on its territory. The country is set to lose billions in transit fees as Russian natural gas is diverted from routes that run through Ukraine. But at least “Germany commits to establish and administer a Green Fund for Ukraine to support Ukraine’s energy transition, energy efficiency, and energy security,” according to the joint statement. The U.S. and Germany say they’ll ask Russia to keep paying Ukraine. Are they kidding?<br />Giving a revisionist power more influence over Europe’s economy doesn’t help U.S. interests. The big win for Russian gas also comes as the Administration moves to restrict fossil-fuel production in the U.S. Angela Merkel, who negotiated the deal with President Biden, soon won’t even be Chancellor.</td>

      <td>Even the Speaker admits her veto of GOP members is ‘unprecedented.’</td>
      <td>When Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced her plan for a House Select Committee to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, she reserved eight members as her choice and left five for Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Well, scratch that. On Wednesday she vetoed two of Mr. McCarthy’s choices as unacceptable.<br />“With respect for the integrity of the investigation, with an insistence on the truth and with concern about statements made and actions taken by these Members, I must reject the recommendations of Representatives [Jim] Banks and [Jim] Jordan to the Select Committee,” the Speaker said in a statement. “The unprecedented nature of January 6th demands this unprecedented decision.”<br />She’s right that her decision is unprecedented. As Minority Leader in 2014, Mrs. Pelosi was allowed to choose her members for the House Select Committee investigating the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.<br />Messrs. Banks and Jordan are fierce partisans, but that can’t be the Speaker’s objection. Her Select Committee choices include Rep. Adam Schiff, who lied repeatedly about the evidence concerning the Trump campaign’s collusion with Russia. The two Republicans don’t share the Speaker’s view that Jan. 6 was an “insurrection,” or attempted coup. But if Mrs. Pelosi thinks the evidence for her conclusion is persuasive, why would she not want to have it tested against the most aggressive critics? Mr. Banks says he wants to focus on why the Capitol was so unprotected that day, which is certainly relevant and might reflect poorly on the Speaker.<br />Mr. McCarthy responded by saying he won’t appoint replacements and the GOP now won’t participate in the Select Committee. It’s hard to blame him. The rioters who broke the law are being punished, and the Select Committee’s partisan purpose has been clear from the start. The Speaker views the committee as a hammer to use against Republicans in 2022, and her veto of the two GOP members proves it.</td>

On Wednesday state Attorneys General  trumpeted a rich opioid settlement with drug distributors and  Johnson & Johnson ,  and there will surely be more.<br />Thousands of lawsuits have been filed around the country that seek to hold drug manufacturers, distributors and retailers liable for the opioid epidemic. Politicians and plaintiff attorneys claim the companies hooked hundreds of thousands of Americans on opioids with deceptive marketing and negligent dispensing practices to boost their bottom line.<br />The main problem with this argument is that opioids such as oxycodone require a doctor’s prescription. Thousands of doctors would have to have been complicit in the conspiracy. Ditto the Drug Enforcement Administration, which is supposed to monitor and control opioid shipments by distributors to pharmacies.<br />Opioid prescriptions have been declining since 2012, and the vast majority of overdose deaths are now from fentanyl sold on the street, often laced with other drugs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last week that opioid deaths increased by nearly 40% last year to 69,710 in 2020, though only 13,637 were from prescription painkillers.<br />But actual legal liability doesn’t count for much when the U.S. mass tort industry gets rolling. Businesses settle because they know they risk getting slammed with enormous jury verdicts if they go to trial.</td>

But he faces an expanding list of challenges, and there are reasons to feel anxious about his ability to handle them.<br />A major problem for the president is the massive mismatch between the Democrats’ narrow margins in Congress—a handful of seats in the House and a 50-50 Senate—and his outsize policy expectations, many of which require large margins in the Senate to win approval. Mr. Biden pretends he has a mandate for transformational changes he didn’t really campaign on.<br />The mismatch is showing itself in the slow pace of congressional action. One example is the Democrats’ inability to move forward their unprecedented federal takeover of local elections. Time is becoming a critical problem for this and other initiatives, since Congress is scheduled to recess for August. Even if it doesn’t, the administration’s growing pileup of legislation won’t be easy to complete.<br />Consider the must-dos. There must be a budget resolution, which is difficult to get done. Though only a simple majority in each chamber is required, a resolution still needs to set allocations for the major parts of the budget. The debt ceiling must also be raised as early as August and, of course, a budget approved. And while it was easy for Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to agree to a global corporate tax rate, its passage through Congress is hardly assured.<br />Mr. Biden’s American Jobs Plan suffers from Bernie Sanders-style ambitions paired with the Democrats’ weak hold on Congress. The magnitude of the Biden tax increases are very unpopular in the suburbs, and the jump in capital-gains tax rates and taxes on inherited assets are detested in farm and ranch country. Moreover, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says the White House’s $3.5 trillion price tag is misleading. Kill the budget gimmicks and its true cost is $5 to $5.5 trillion. Voter resistance to these astronomical levels of spending is likely to grow.</td>

      <td>They deserve support from my childhood friend as they battle the communists.</td>
      <td>The Cuban people are risking their lives by fighting to liberate themselves from the communist Castro regime. The Biden administration’s response has been weak. The worst moment came last week when Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told Cubans: “If you take to the sea, you will not come to the United States.”<br />I took that personally—not only because my family fled Fidel Castro’s Cuba for the U.S. in 1960, but because I know Mr. Mayorkas as “Ali,” a childhood friend from California and the son of my father’s best friend, Nicholas Mayorkas. My family and the Mayorkas family have ties stretching back to our parents’ childhood—two Cuban families that sought, and found, a better future for their children in America. Ali owes his success in no small part to the sacrifices his Republican father made in fleeing the Castro regime.<br />Here’s what Messrs. Biden and Mayorkas should do: They should express unwavering support for the Cuban people. They should continue the Trump administration’s hard-line policy toward the Castro regime, not enable it by pushing for reconciliation. They should maintain the economic embargo and Cuba’s listing as a state sponsor of terror. They should immediately provide the Cuban people with free and abundant internet access so they can document the abuses of their communist oppressors.<br />Instead, Mr. Biden and his fellow Democrats are offering misinformation. It is unacceptable to repeat the Cuban regime’s lies and pretend that this historic milestone in the Cuban people’s decadeslong struggle for freedom is merely a response to Covid-19. It is unacceptable to blame U.S. sanctions for Cuba’s misery. Communism is the failure here.<br />Liberal critics of American foreign policy often point to the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo, claiming that it undermines our moral authority. All of Cuba is a prison camp and has been for 62 years. Cuban families are now risking everything to bring change to the island of our birth. They deserve support from American leaders and the American people—including Mr. Biden and Ali Mayorkas, my childhood friend.</td>

      <td>Decades of corruption and maladministration came to a head in last week’s riots. It’s time for real reform.</td>
      <td>A week of widespread rioting and looting in South Africa has ended. The turmoil’s cost is still being determined, but at least 276 people died, some of them trampled to death in stampedes, and the economic damage will run to billions of dollars. The country’s health infrastructure, already tottering under the weight of the Covid-19 pandemic, was virtually shattered in some areas by looting and arson. Major highways and a rail link were shut down for days.<br />The riots are barely over, so determining their “what” and “why” is difficult. The trigger was the jailing of the country’s former President Jacob Zuma, who was detained for ignoring a summons to appear before a commission investigating corruption. He has good cause to fear an inquiry. During his nine-year tenure, the country may have lost more than $34 billion to graft, according to his successor, President Cyril Ramaphosa. One of the most infamous scandals involved allegations that members of the wealthy Gupta family purchased so much influence with Mr. Zuma that they bartered cabinet positions in his government.<br />The deeper causes behind the unrest are murky. As with all South African presidents since the end of apartheid in 1994, Mr. Zuma was also head of the ruling African National Congress. The corruption scandals that embroiled him and the recession-prone economy over which he presided eventually made him a political liability, and the ANC forced him out in 2018. Yet a bloc of Zuma loyalists has continued to battle for power with Mr. Ramaphosa. Mr. Zuma’s arrest was a victory for Mr. Ramaphosa, as was the earlier suspension from the party of one of Mr. Zuma’s powerful allies.<br />The Ramaphosa government pins blame for the turmoil on Zuma supporters. Last week authorities said they had identified 12 ringleaders of what Mr. Ramaphosa called a “deliberate, coordinated and well-planned attack” on South Africa’s democracy. There may be a kernel of truth to that. Some pro-Zuma voices openly agitated for violence, and some of the attacks on infrastructure appeared to be coordinated.<br />Yet the scale and intensity of the unrest reveals a deeper problem. Mr. Ramaphosa’s political enemies could not have set parts of South Africa ablaze without the tinder provided by the ANC’s decadeslong mismanagement of the country. The ANC-led government’s bumbling during the HIV epidemic in the late 1990s and early 2000s likely cost more than 330,000 South African lives. Its aggressive affirmative action program, Black Economic Empowerment, has enriched a small clique of wealthy black South Africans while deterring investment. The 30% unemployment rate is essentially unchanged since 1994, and youth unemployment has climbed to a disastrous 74%. Blackouts, in Africa’s most industrialized economy, are common.</td>

      <td>The decision to shun the country has legal implications in many states and perhaps even at the federal level.</td>
      <td>Ben & Jerry’s, the Vermont-based ice-cream company that prides itself on its progressive politics, announced Monday that it is cancelling its license with its Israeli affiliate. The move by Ben & Jerry’s, a wholly owned subsidiary of global consumer-products giant  Unilever ,  amounts to a boycott of Israel. And this triggers a wave of legal and regulatory issues for the Dutch-American parent.<br />Ben & Jerry’s operates in Israel through a licensee, an Israeli company that has been with the brand for 30 years and operates one of its few foreign manufacturing facilities. After a social-media pressure campaign from anti-Israel leftists, the company insisted that the Israeli licensee not sell ice cream in parts of Jerusalem, including the Jewish Quarter, and the West Bank, much of which is controlled by the Palestinian Authority and parts of which are under Israeli civil jurisdiction.<br />Ben & Jerry’s knew this was an offer the licensee had to refuse. Parts of what the company calls “occupied Palestinian territory” Israel (as well as the U.S.) considers sovereign Israeli territory. Israeli law bars boycotts of Israeli citizens, Jewish or Arab, based on their location. So Unilever cancelled the Israeli Ben & Jerry’s entirely because it wouldn’t engage in a secondary boycott.<br />Because Ben & Jerry’s is a wholly owned subsidiary of Unilever, the latter is responsible for its boycott. In the past eight years, 33 American states have passed laws that restrict government contracting or investing in companies that boycott Israeli people or businesses. These laws are modeled on similar restrictions on companies that discriminate on other grounds, such as sexual orientation.<br />This means that, in about a dozen states, state employees’ pension funds will be barred from investment in Unilever. In many other states, government entities will be barred from buying goods or services from Unilever. Moreover, since the 1970s, federal law has banned U.S. companies from participating in foreign boycotts of any country. If it turns out that the Palestinian Authority contacted Ben & Jerry’s or its officers and asked them to boycott, criminal penalties would be available against Unilever.</td>

      <td>Needle exchanges, bleach kits and other forms of ‘harm reduction,’ though once controversial, are now mainstream. Will they stay that way?</td>
      <td>Fifty years ago, Richard Nixon declared what came to be known as the War on Drugs. The first of its two major campaigns was aimed at disrupting supply lines—from coca and poppy fields abroad to dealers in the U.S. The second was aimed at reducing demand: discouraging drug use, especially among teenagers, and providing treatment to those who had succumbed to addiction.<br />Both efforts continue today, with varying degrees of success (and failure). The second one in particular, over time, has required a change of tactics. It turned out that, when it comes to treatment, not all users want it, and even many of those who do may drop out of treatment programs. What to do about these hold-outs: people who have no intention of quitting drugs or who, having started in a program, find the prospect of quitting too daunting?<br />This is where “harm reduction” comes in. A classic example is clean-needle distribution, a practice that slims the odds of drug users becoming infected with Hepatitis C and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Harm-reduction workers “meet people where they are at,” as the slogan goes, without judgment. The approach is part of a larger effort to mitigate the effects of drug prohibition: e.g., the reluctance of users to seek medical help out of fear of arrest or to enter programs geared toward abstinence. The effort extends to providing apartments (the “housing-first” approach) where drug use is condoned. The idea is to embrace users and nudge them toward social functioning, even toward abstinence—but on the client’s time line.<br />Science journalist Maia Szalavitz has been an avid participant in the “harm-reduction movement” since her days of heavy drug use. In “Undoing Drugs,” she tells her own story and offers the first popular account of the movement’s people and politics.<br />In 1986, the 20-year-old Ms. Szalavitz was living in New York’s East Village, having been suspended from Columbia University for dealing cocaine and now injecting cocaine and heroin. At the time, she didn’t know that needle sharing put her at risk for HIV. When an acquaintance warned her against sharing needles and, if she did share, urged to run bleach through the syringe, she was “furious” that such information wasn’t widely known.</td>

      <td>PG&E Corp. said Wednesday that it plans to bury 10,000 miles of power lines to reduce wildfire risk throughout Northern California at an estimated cost of up to $20 billion, reversing its earlier stance that doing so would be prohibitively expensive.<br />The utility company, which serves about 16 million customers in northern and central California, said the effort will substantially reduce the likelihood of its power lines sparking wildfires as drought and climate change heighten the risk of large, fast-moving blazes.<br />“We know that we have long argued that undergrounding was too expensive,” Chief Executive Patti Poppe said. “This is where we say it’s too expensive not to underground. Lives are on the line.”<br />PG&E’s equipment has ignited more than 20 California wildfires within the past several years that have collectively killed more than 100 people and burned thousands of homes. Most of the fires were sparked when trees or branches touched the company’s wires.<br />PG&E disclosed to California regulators earlier this week that one of its power lines may have been involved in the ignition of one of the fires currently ravaging the West, the Dixie Fire, which has grown to cover more than 85,000 acres in Northern California. The company said in a regulatory filing that an employee responding to a power outage discovered a fire beneath one of its distribution lines in the Feather River Canyon in the forested Sierra Nevada foothills.</td>

      <td>St. Regis, the latest structure by Windy City architect Jeanne Gang, is a mixed-use tower that undulates as it rises and is the tallest building designed by a woman.</td>
      <td>Chicago<br />Do not confuse the shape of a fashionable residential tower with the artistic line drawn by an architect. It is the line of truce after a battle. A developer fights to expand his territory, his holy volume of rentable space, and the architect pushes back, trying to carve and sculpt that volume, and to make it beautiful. The developer wins, of course, giving us the box with an all-glass skin that is the industry standard of high-rise housing.<br />But there are exceptions. The three interlocking and progressively taller towers that make up the St. Regis Chicago, this city’s newest and most prominent residential and hotel development, are as exquisitely contoured as a work of abstract sculpture. Each successive level is set back five inches and then, once 12 stories are reached, the process is reversed and the levels start to step outward. These 12-story modules have the shape of a decapitated pyramid--the technical term is “frustum”—and in their alternating inward and outward taper the towers call to mind Brancusi’s celebrated Endless Column. Yet for all their slenderness they manage to accommodate a daunting 1.9 million square feet, a colossal amount of residential and hotel space, in the most elegant fashion imaginable.<br />The St. Regis Chicago (which began life on the drawing board in 2014 as the Wanda Vista Tower) was meant to open last year, but after the inevitable delays it is opening only now. The 393 condominiums on the upper levels are partially occupied while its 191-room hotel and restaurant are still under construction. Nonetheless, it is sufficiently complete to take its measure. Prominently sited on the Chicago River, just east of Lake Michigan, it rises a full 101 stories, making it the city’s third-tallest building. It is easily the most important addition to the Chicago skyline in a generation—no small feat in America’s most celebrated architectural city.<br />The building is the work of Studio Gang, the Chicago firm with a knack for drawing aesthetic lessons from purely technical considerations. For nearly a decade it has been experimenting with “solar carving,” its term for the shaping of a building in accordance with the moving path of the sun. With the St. Regis, the calculations were unusually complex. As its girth varies, so does the relative amount of sunlight it receives, the heat gain rising as the footprint shrinks. To offset the difference, the architects hit upon the idea of progressively tinting the glass so that each floor receives the exact same quantity of sunlight and heat.</td>

      <td>This year, the New York Guitar Festival honors the legacy of classical guitarist Julian Bream with an impressive lineup of virtual performances.</td>
      <td><br />The New York Guitar Festival, presented biennially since 1999, has avoided stylistic pigeonholing by shifting its focus with each installment: a classical guitar potpourri might be followed by a festival built around the music of Bruce Springsteen, an influential bluesman like the Rev. Gary Davis or a Gospel-rocker like Sister Rosetta Tharpe. And within an announced theme, the variety of players and interpretive approaches is typically broad, thanks no doubt to the eclectic tastes of the festival’s founders, David Spelman, a classical guitarist turned entrepreneur, and John Schaefer, the host of several influential new-music programs on WNYC.<br />This year’s edition was nearly doomed by the pandemic, but Mr. Spelman had his heart set on a tribute to Julian Bream, the British virtuoso who died in August, at age 87. His solution was to invite 18 guitarists and three lutenists to submit video performances, and to post three clips daily between July 14 and 20 on the festival’s YouTube page. They can be viewed there indefinitely, along with recordings from past festivals.<br />“Remembering Julian Bream” has a starry roster that includes Eliot Fisk, Sharon Isbin, Pepe Romero, David Leisner, Paul O’Dette, Hopkinson Smith, Jason Vieaux and several promising younger players performing music associated with Bream. But the festival’s heart is a half-dozen commissioned works, all by guitarists who also compose.<br />Most listeners still think of Andrés Segovia as the architect of the modern classical guitar world, and there is no denying that Segovia reconfigured attitudes about the instrument. But Bream’s contributions were far more significant. Where Segovia’s interpretive style was self-consciously Romantic, Bream’s readings were streamlined and modern, yet sacrificed nothing in warmth or emotional weight. He also had an early place in the period instrument world, having revived the Renaissance lute and its repertory. And most crucially, where Segovia was content with works by composers who were barely known outside the guitar world, Bream commissioned music from composers with international reputations, among them Benjamin Britten, William Walton, Michael Tippett, Hans Werner Henze, Toru Takemitsu and dozens more, many of which have become centerpieces of the guitar’s repertory.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Federal Trade Commission said it wants to give consumers more power to fix devices such as smartphones and home appliances, voting to step up efforts targeting manufacturers if the agency determines repair restrictions are illegal.<br />The FTC unanimously adopted a new policy Wednesday laying out concerns about device-repair restrictions and said it would investigate them. The bipartisan vote followed an executive order signed July 9 by President Biden directing the FTC to consider writing rules to address “unfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party repair or self-repair of items.”<br />Manufacturers restrict the repair of their equipment by limiting the availability of parts and repair information, steering consumers to their own repair networks, claiming patent and trademark rights and designing products in ways that make repairs more difficult, according to the FTC.<br />Consumer-advocacy groups and repair companies want policymakers to back what they call “Right to Repair.” They argue manufacturers in a range of industries, from  Apple Inc.  smartphones to  Deere  & Co. tractors, make it too hard for consumers to get the parts and information needed to fix devices. They also say that manufacturers design products in ways that make repairs difficult and restrict competition among repair technicians, which can make fixes more expensive.<br />Lina Khan, the new chairwoman of the FTC, backed those concerns Wednesday. “These types of restrictions can significantly raise costs for consumers, stifle innovation, close off business opportunities for independent repair shops, create unnecessary electronic waste, [and] delay timely repairs,” she said at a virtual public meeting.</td>
