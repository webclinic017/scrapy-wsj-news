      <td>Investors have a right to know how an invasion of Taiwan would affect business.</td>
      <td>The Securities and Exchange Commission is prodding publicly owned companies to disclose how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is affecting their operations.  BP ,   Shell  and  Exxon Mobil  have booked charges of $25.5 billion, $8.4 billion and $3.4 billion respectively, but the major oil companies aren’t the only ones losing money.  General Electric  took a $200 million charge, and  McDonald ’s  is losing $50 million a month from closing its Russian operations. Netflix suspended service in Russia and lost 700,000 viewers, the first time in a decade its viewership has declined.<br />All this is peanuts compared with what might lie ahead should China attempt to invade Taiwan. Trade between the U.S. and China was worth $615 billion in 2020, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. In contrast, U.S.-Russia trade was only worth about $35 billion in 2019. But that disparity in trade volume is only the tip of the iceberg. The stuff we get from China—from antibiotics and smartphones to minerals and metals needed for green technology—is much more important than almost anything we get from Russia. The Biden administration wants to commit the U.S. to a green agenda, but 80% of the rare-earth minerals needed for that technology are processed by China.</td>

This week the drama moves to the Senate, where Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer plans a vote on a sweeping bill to override state laws and set a national abortion policy.<br />House Democrats passed the Women’s Health Protection Act (WHPA) last year, but it stalled in the Senate. It’s expected to fail again this week. But that isn’t stopping Mr. Schumer, who is refusing to take up a bill by GOP Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, who have their own proposal to codify Roe v. Wade. “I have long supported a woman’s right to choose,” Ms. Murkowski said, “but my position is not without limits, and this partisan Women’s Health Protection Act simply goes too far.”</td>

Russian ruble volatility and U.S. dollar security and stability have made American currency a preferred savings mechanism. For years, Russians’ bill of preference has been the $100.

Abrams and Cohen leave out that Tikvah, their organization, took months to provide details about its event, and when it finally did, it was clear it would have been too disruptive for the museum.<br />Tikvah reached out in January about renting our space. For months we sought details. Our charter does not allow rentals for purely political or religious reasons, and this is made clear to anyone who requests to rent our space. In late April, when Tikvah came back to us, it presented a plan that would have required using more of our public space and resources—and requested additional police security—that presented logistical challenges on what is normally our busiest day.

The prospect of inflation is likely to make people even more attuned to their cash, too. A recent survey of about 2,000 U.S. consumers, published by Morgan Stanley analysts on Monday, found that concern about inflation was the highest ever in their survey history. Over 40% of respondents said they would consider opening a new savings account for a rate of 1%, and over 60% would consider it for 2%. Importantly, too, 57% of consumers believe that opening a new account is “simple and worth the effort,” perhaps reflecting the success of financial technology in making action less painful than in past eras.</td>

      <td>The Democrat turned independent candidate for California governor thinks a little common sense can go a long way in the Golden State.</td>
      <td>California Gov. Gavin Newsom handily survived a recall election last fall by smearing his Republican opponents as Donald Trump toadies. While the recall didn’t defeat Mr. Newsom, it also didn’t make him politically stronger. Frustration with Covid lockdowns has receded, but anger over the state’s myriad other problems—crime, homelessness, lousy schools, high energy and housing costs and electricity blackouts, among other things—hasn’t waned. Disapproval of Mr. Newsom’s job performance, especially among independents, has risen since the recall.<br />Enter Michael Shellenberger, 50, a former Democrat running for governor as an independent. His political evolution resembles the cartoon recently tweeted by Elon Musk—a stationary guy in the center left of the political spectrum finds himself being pulled to the center right as his fellow liberals sprint the other way. A self-described “eco-modernist,” Mr. Shellenberger has plenty of company in the Golden State. Most Californians aren’t nearly as liberal as the state’s political class, but Republicans have struggled to win statewide in part because their anti-immigrant rhetoric and cultural conservatism have turned off Hispanics and young people. Mr. Shellenberger is testing whether a political moderate running on quality-of-life issues can break the progressive stranglehold on Sacramento. He needs to place second in the state’s jungle primary on June 7 to face off against Mr. Newsom head-to-head in November.</td>

As of a month ago, the day that Howard Schultz returned for his third stint as chief executive officer, it had nearly 10 times as many shops in North America.<br />When Mr. Schultz revealed that store count along with the chain’s unspectacular fiscal-second-quarter results, the chain’s shares were down by more than 40% from their all-time high last summer. Cost and wage pressures along with a bitterly contested unionization drive at home, and a recent sales collapse in China, the chain’s second-largest market, all weighed on sentiment. But this past Wednesday, the first trading session following the release, the shares surged by nearly 10% in their best day since a sharp rebound in March 2020 following the Covid-19 market panic. That came despite the fact that the company suspended financial guidance for this year.</td>

When the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was passed, we were criticized for being overly optimistic about the effects we predicted it would have. Now the evidence is in. Our critics were wrong, and the economic data have met or even exceeded our predictions.<br />In 2017, we predicted that reducing the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% and introducing full expensing of new-equipment investment would boost productivity-enhancing business investment by 9%. Though growth in business investment had been slowing in the years leading up to 2017, after tax reform it surged. By the end of 2019 it was 9.4% above its pre-2017 trend, exactly in line with the prediction of our models. Looking solely at corporate businesses—those most directly affected by business-tax reform in 2017—real investment was up by as much as 14.2% over the pre-2017 trend, slightly more than we expected. Among S&P 500 companies, total capital expenditures in the two years after tax reform were 20% higher than in the two years prior, when capital expenditures actually declined.</td>

      <td>Old English words can be vaguely familiar and strangely evocative. They conjure a long-ago world of mundane worries and wild imaginings.</td>
      <td>The language now known as Old English arrived in Britain in the fifth century, not long after the end of Roman rule, brought by settlers from northern Germany and southern Scandinavia. It was in use for 700 years, but only about 200 manuscripts containing any Old English survive, mainly from the period between 900 and 1100, and they comprise a total of 3.5 million words—fewer than in the current U.S. tax code. Today most people who engage with Old English do so at college and treat it as a dusty relic of a less enlightened age. Those who have not encountered it tend to imagine it’s the stuff of archaic English pub signs. Worse, they assume it’s the name for the language of Geoffrey Chaucer (which is actually Middle English) or Shakespeare (which is technically Early Modern English, despite student protestations to the contrary).<br />Hana Videen is one of a rare and treasurable breed of enthusiasts who want to remedy such misconceptions. Since the fall of 2013, she has taken to Twitter every day, as @OEWordhord, to post a single example of an Old English word. More than eight years on, the fruit of this slow accumulation is her first book. I doubt that I’m alone in frowning at the proliferation of nonfiction that began life as burblings on social media, and there’s an undelightful subgenre of Twitterature consisting of volumes that merely pile up linguistic trivia. But Ms. Videen is both a passionate medievalist and a relaxed, lucid writer; the pleasure she takes in her subject is infectious.</td>

I could be an insider or I could be an outsider. Outsiders can say whatever they want. But people on the inside don’t listen to them. Insiders, however, get lots of access and a chance to push their ideas. People—powerful people—listen to what they have to say. But insiders also understand one unbreakable rule: They don’t criticize other insiders.”<br />Want to see this in action? In his 2021 book, “A Plague Upon Our House,” about his time as an adviser to the Trump administration on Covid-19, the Hoover Institution’s Scott Atlas describes “a functioning troika of ‘medical experts’ composed of Drs. Birx, Fauci, and Redfield.” He “noticed that there was virtually no disagreement among them. It was an amazing consistency, as though there were an agreed-upon complicity—even though some of their statements were so patently simplistic or erroneous.” Loyalty! But was that for the best?

      <td>Justice Alito should conserve the original meaning of the 14th Amendment, not the New Deal.</td>
      <td>Regarding David Garrow’s op-ed “Justice Alito’s Originalist Triumph” (May 5): Justice Samuel Alito’s leaked draft opinion relies on the post-1937 New Deal idea that all social and economic matters are subject to the rational-basis test. He thus conserves New Deal constitutionalism and Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes’s dissent in Lochner v. New York (1905), not the original meaning of the 14th Amendment in 1868.<br />A true originalist ruling overturning Roe v. Wade (1973) would say that abortion is not a privilege or immunity of citizenship because it is not deeply rooted in American tradition or in the concept of ordered liberty, as is required by Corfield v. Coryell (1823), the case that the framers of the 14th Amendment said interpreted its most important clause: the Privileges or Immunities Clause.</td>

By contrast, my 1974 high-school science and mathematics teachers banded together to offer a class in “futuristics,” a blend of alarming, Paul Ehrlich-inspired graphs and extrapolations filling our young minds with overpopulation, exhausted resources, endless war and so forth.<br />Meanwhile, as my classmates and I were being told we had no future, Steve Jobs was in India experimenting with Buddhism and LSD.</td>

Meanwhile, our primary schools teach the opposite.<br />The best illustration of the divergence between parents’ expectations and the education establishment’s actions is in California. A group designated by California’s Education Department came up in 2019 with the first draft of the Ethnic Studies Curriculum (ESC). It was roundly rejected for its ideological and anti-Semitic content expressed in an unprofessional jargon. The second draft, in 2020, wasn’t much better. Finally, the third draft, in 2021, had some improvements. Still, it remains divisive and tendentious, presenting America as frozen in the slavery years and abusive of minorities who have never experienced any meaningful betterment.</td>

The plunge came just a day after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell appeared to clear the way for a stock rally by casting interest-rate increases larger than a half-percentage point as unlikely.<br />The scale of Thursday’s decline and the recent surge of volatility raised questions about larger issues in the markets, such as the unwinding of leveraged trades or the possible liquidation of funds following big wrong-way bets. But many investors and analysts say the action has largely been consistent with the broad market retreat this year, driven by expectations that rates will rise. Portfolio managers say advancing rates will tend to benefit dividend-paying stocks, for instance, while adding to the pressure on speculative trades that were popular and profitable when money was free.</td>

In contrast to Michelangelo’s muscular and manly version across town in the Accademia, Donatello’s “David” is a slender adolescent, wearing only fancy boots, a helmet that resembles a sun hat, and an enigmatic, downward-cast gaze. Although other artists were exploring the nude during this period, inspired by ancient Roman sculpture and newly expanded subject matter, Donatello’s “David” still surprises.

A pipeline shortage has reduced the incentive for drillers to produce more natural gas. Yet states in the mid- and south Atlantic desperately need more gas as their populations grow.</td>

      <td>As food prices skyrocket, the world needs to admit it can’t live without modern, efficient agriculture.</td>
      <td>The energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine disabused many politicians of the notion that the world could make a swift transition to green energy powered by solar, wind and wishful thinking. As food prices skyrocket and the conflict threatens a global food crisis, we need to face another unpopular reality: Organic farming is ineffective, land hungry and very expensive, and it would leave billions hungry if it were embraced world-wide.<br />For years, politicians and the chattering classes have argued that organic farming is the responsible way to feed the world. The European Union pushed last year for members roughly to triple organic farming by 2030. Influential nonprofits have long promoted organic farming to developing nations, causing fragile countries like Sri Lanka to invest in such methods. In the West, many consumers have been won over: About half the population of Germany believes that organic farming can fight global hunger.</td>

      <td>When Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, nearly every international observer expected a Russian victory within days or at most a few weeks. The Ukrainians surprised us all. Anyone interested in foreign affairs has an opinion about the war, but how do Ukrainians feel? Thanks to an unprecedented effort from the International Republican Institute to conduct a nationwide poll of Ukraine during a time of war, we now know what its people think about the conflict, their leadership and the future of their country.<br />Several results stand out. First, President Volodymyr Zelensky commands a 94% approval rating. This is a striking turnaround for a leader who was previously seen as inexperienced and ineffective. After winning the election as a political novice with 73% of the vote, Mr. Zelensky’s public approval rating had fallen to only 25% last October. But in times of national emergency, true leaders rise to the occasion. He has excelled in the role of warrior-president and won the hearts of the people he was elected to serve.</td>

One of them involved the rules of matrimony, and shortly after his separation from Mary, Milton penned several tracts in favor of permitting divorce due to incompatibility.

      <td>American voters are hungry for common sense and purpose. Republicans and Democrats are giving them strife and division instead.</td>
      <td>We often hear that America is a deeply polarized society, divided by party, region, and lifestyle. We the people, pundits tell us, are hopeless, too busy pulling down the other side to clean up the wreckage. But what if we the people aren’t really the problem? What if most everyday Americans share a moral compass, even if they sometimes approach issues from different directions? What if the real problem is that our political institutions stop us from coming together?<br />In December 2020, I set out to test this possibility by journeying into the heart of American politics. I launched a 15-month campaign for governor of Massachusetts. I was a political outsider and a first-time candidate. I hadn’t run for anything since secretary of communications in high school,                                                                                        unless you count faculty council at the universities where I’ve been a professor. When Woodrow Wilson ran for office, people asked him why he’d left the university. His answer: “I was tired of the politics.” There’s a deep truth there, but at the end of the day, I can’t pretend running for faculty council is anything like running for governor. I truly was a novice.</td>

It is a mixed nature, part animal and part rational, and the rational has only a very tenuous control over the passionate. It is a credit to long-established laws and institutions that human beings have come together to form relatively peaceful and productive nation-states. We haven’t become better.<br />Second, the progress of nation-states must be viewed in the context of the international order. It is a Hobbesian order with no overarching power to create or enforce law. The equilibria that arise from efforts to balance opportunities and threats are unstable and require great skill and cost to maintain.

It has never happened!”) are incorrect.<br />Ms. Noonan reaches this conclusion by looking at the poor Russian military performance in Ukraine and at Mr. Putin’s nihilistic character. May I suggest a third, historical factor? Mr. Putin is a Soviet man; he lived his first 39 years in the Soviet Union, rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the KGB foreign intelligence and publicly rued the U.S.S.R.’s demise.

It is common knowledge that, with the advance of modern science, this issue has come to mean a matter of life and death for civilisation as we know it.”<br />Rulers and their arms-merchant cronies manipulate public opinion, Einstein reflected. But “how is it possible for this small clique to bend the will of the majority, who stand to lose and suffer by a state of war, to the service of their ambitions?” Propaganda had to be part of any explanation. The government “has the schools and press, usually the Church as well, under its thumb,” he wrote. “This enables it to organize and sway the emotions of the masses, and makes its tool of them.” But as a rationalist, Einstein was still baffled. “How is it these devices succeed so well in rousing men to such wild enthusiasm, even to sacrifice their lives?” Is it down to human nature, he wondered?

I know him only from his occasional essays, which are generally sprightly, never less than interesting, and usually fairly short. “The Last Days of Roger Federer” is a great ragbag of a book, containing 180 sections of varying length on everything but that most useful of all appliances found in the modern kitchen.</td>

      <td>The quest for the headwaters of the famed African river has been an obsession of explorers for centuries.</td>
      <td>Candice Millard is drawn to the rivers that challenged the outsiders who tried to explore them. The backdrop of her fine 2005 book, “River of Doubt,” is a tributary of the Aripuaña River in Brazil. In “River of the Gods,” she surveys the “genius, courage, and betrayal” involved “in the search for the source of the Nile.”<br />As a consequence of the struggle between the French and British over who would dominate Egypt in the 18th and 19th centuries, especially after the decipherment of the Rosetta Stone’s hieroglyphics in 1822, “Europe’s fascination with Egyptian history and the Nile Valley,” Ms. Millard writes, “had grown into a full-scale frenzy.” One result was a lust to discover the source of that mythic body of water. Indeed, such an objective was the “Holy Grail of exploration.” (Specifically, Ms. Millard’s book is about one of the river’s branches, the White Nile.)</td>

      <td>New retreats—in Brazil, Switzerland and Sweden—whose architects have gone outrageously organic with their designs</td>
      <td>HOTEL DEVELOPERS are, increasingly, enlisting famous architects and letting them produce designs that bear more resemblance to installation art than to their boxy brethren. French entrepreneur Alexandre Allard hired Pritzker Prize-winning architect Jean Nouvel to transform an old hospital compound in Brazil’s largest city into a luxury hotel. “I called up one of the guys who designed Paris’ Institut du Monde Arabe and said, ‘Jean, we have to create something crazy that will stand out as an architectural symbol in São Paulo’s sea of otherwise banal concrete high-rises,’” said Mr. Allard, whose vertical forest hotel, the Rosewood São Paulo, is slated to fully open this summer. Mr. Nouvel isn’t the only architect whose tastes are running woodsy. Modern treehouse cabins are sprouting in the Scandinavian hinterland, and the roof of a new Swiss lodge is designed to double as a walking trail. Here, we talk to the architects about their natural impulses.<br />When designing the new tower for Rosewood São Paulo, Pritzker Prize-winning architect Jean Nouvel reckoned that part of the Bela Vista neighborhood around Avenida Paulista was lacking in two things: terraces and trees. “I wanted to use vegetation as an architectural material, ensuring it invaded the guest rooms,” said Mr. Nouvel. Fourteen robust species were recruited from Brazil’s Mata Atlântica rainforest, but concerns mounted that São Paulo’s gusty winds might wreak havoc with a vertical forest. “The difficulty wasn’t displaying these 40- and 50-foot-tall trees,” the architect said, but in re-planting them onto the building so that they could prosper. Myriad engineers were engaged to consult with an indigenous Tupi Guarianí tribe chief, who helped find trees that were “happy,” and then plot and test the transplanted ecosystem. The result: a 26-floor forest. Some 240 trees now line the facade. Pink trumpets and violet-flowering jacarandas traverse several floors, and poke through holes in the weathered-looking steel roof so that the building resembles a chia pet.</td>

      <td>They might be tech-obsessed Gen-Zers, but today’s graduates still want mechanical watches. Here, expert tips for buying tickers they’ll appreciate—plus, what to do if they lose that Rolex.</td>
      <td>ANDREW SHEAR’S SON is in preschool, but the 36-year-old dad has already purchased his child’s college graduation gift: a Rolex Daytona from 2017, the year his son was born. Mind you, Mr. Shear is a vintage watch dealer through his company Sheartime, so he’s professionally obligated to believe mechanical watches will still be covetable in 2040. Tradition is on his side: Watches have been beloved milestone gifts for at least a century. A 1928 Elgin watch ad shilling bezels between $15 and $1,500 declares: “This solves the graduation gift problem.”<br />With a penchant for vintage, today’s grads, who have grown up with the internet at their fingertips (and on their wrists), obsess over old-school watches’ mechanical workings and supreme style. “Young customers come in having been up all night studying on YouTube,” said Ruediger Albers, U.S. president of watch retailer Wempe. According to Ira Melnitsky, U.S. president and CEO at Tourneau | Bucherer, which has seen an uptick in grad-watch sales in the past three years, the youths “appreciate a mechanical item that’s not disposable.”</td>
