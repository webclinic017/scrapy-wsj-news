Lin Wood and other attorneys who represented six Republican voters in the lawsuit.<br />“Despite the haze of confusion, commotion, and chaos counsel intentionally attempted to create by filing this lawsuit, one thing is perfectly clear: Plaintiffs’ attorneys have scorned their oath, flouted the rules, and attempted to undermine the integrity of the judiciary along the way,” Judge Parker wrote.<br />Ms. Powell and Mr. Wood didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.</td>

The alleged victims range in age from 15 to 51 years old.</td>

      <td>Billions of dollars in military equipment and vehicles aren’t the only assets the U.S. is leaving behind in Afghanistan as it makes its hasty retreat. On Monday “Afghanistan, Islamic State of” was credited with 310 million in new “special drawing rights” at the International Monetary Fund. That’s the equivalent of some $440 million.<br />The new SDRs are part of a $650 billion global allocation of IMF funny money that goes to all 190 members in proportion to their IMF quota. If countries wish to convert their SDRs to dollars, the U.S. has to borrow the money to give to them. The conversion creates a subsidized, perpetual loan. For a poor country like Afghanistan, the subsidy would be above 90% of the loan value.<br />Afghanistan’s SDRs cannot be converted into hard currency until the Taliban is allowed access to them, and that requires recognition of the new government by a majority of IMF voting shares. But as the dictatorship of Belarus is demonstrating, that bar is lower than President Biden’s credibility with NATO.<br />We warned in March against this giant new SDR drop, noting that many undemocratic countries would benefit, including China, Russia, Venezuela, Iran, Zimbabwe, Nicaragua and Syria. There are other ways to help poor nations. But Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen preferred the general allocation route because as long as the U.S. share of that allocation is less than the U.S. equity stake in the fund, a proportional disbursement can be made without Congressional approval.<br />The G-7 plus the rest of the European Unionhave the votes to block a country’s access to the IMF by refusing to recognize its government. But countries that are blocked—Venezuela and Myanmar—are the exceptions, not the rule.</td>

      <td>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul’s moderate reputation may not last long. In her first day in the office vacated by Andrew Cuomo, Ms. Hochul promised to help gerrymander the Empire State to the benefit of Democrats in Washington, D.C.<br />The  New York Times  asked Ms. Hochul in an interview, “Do you plan to use your influence to help Democrats expand the House majority through the redistricting process?” Nice leading question. She answered: “Yes. I am also the leader of the New York State Democratic Party. I embrace that. I have a responsibility to lead this party, as well as the government.”<br />She added, in response to the next question, that “I have to help make sure there are more Democrats there to help Joe Biden get his agenda through the Senate.”<br />By a 15-point margin, New Yorkers in 2014 passed a constitutional amendment creating a bipartisan commission to take the lead on redistricting. The commission is slated to publish an outline of its first proposal by Sept. 15.<br />Yet after Democrats took control of both chambers of the New York Legislature in 2018, they began to look for ways to undermine the new commission. Another redistricting amendment on the ballot this November would do precisely that. It would implement complicated rule changes in the redistricting process ahead of the 2022 elections, but the main objective is to reduce GOP leverage.</td>

      <td>Don’t blame the Supreme Court for the mess at the border.</td>
      <td>The Supreme Court caused a stir late Tuesday with a one-paragraph order reinstating a Trump-era immigration policy. The practical impact won’t be large in the near term, but the order is notable for the legal irony of the Court’s explanation.<br />The Biden Administration has “failed to show a likelihood of success on the claim that the memorandum rescinding the Migrant Protection Protocols was not arbitrary and capricious,” said the order for a 6-3 majority. “See Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of Univ. of Cal.”<br />This is the same legal rationale the Court used in that Regents case to overturn the Trump Administration’s decision to rescind Barack Obama’s DACA program for young adult immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. Liberals cheered that ruling, which held that the rescission was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because Trump officials had not sufficiently considered the effects or alternatives. Now the APA review has tripped up the immigration left.<br />The move was the latest development in Biden v. Texas, a battle over the Department of Homeland Security’s Remain in Mexico policy. President Biden on his first day in office halted the policy, which since 2019 had required migrants seeking asylum at the southern border to stay in Mexico before their hearings. Texas and Missouri won a lower court injunction this month to restore the policy, but the Administration asked the High Court to stay the ruling.<br />The Court said no, with the three liberal Justices dissenting. Which is odd, since they were on the opposite side of the legal argument in the DACA case. Results-oriented jurisprudence? Just asking.</td>

Another migration crisis in Europe could be among the most consequential.<br />“Migrants and refugees from Syria, Iraq and Libya will be joined by people from Afghanistan,” Belarusian dictator Alexander LukashenkosaidMonday. “Even though they are going to end up in the West, they will be going and flying through Belarus.”<br />Mr. Lukashenko, isolated after his brazen theft of last year’s presidential election, has been facilitating illegal immigration into Europe. So far more than 4,000 have crossed into neighboring Lithuania this year, up from a few dozen in 2020. Poland and Latvia also have had to reinforce their borders with Belarus as they cope with thousands of illegal crossings.<br />The strongman has made clear that Minsk is weaponizing the migrants over the European Union’s sanctions on his government’s elites and some Belarusian industries. He told the U.S. and U.K. to “choke on your sanctions” earlier this month. Mr. Lukashenko has plenty of reason to believe he can behave with impunity.<br />The International Monetary Fund this week granted the regime a nearly $1 billion lifeline through “special drawing rights.” (See nearby.) Mr. Biden and his European counterparts, overwhelmed in Afghanistan, never organized effective opposition to the move despite their influence at the IMF.</td>

      <td>Strict behavioral rituals make religious groups effective at organizing collective action.</td>
      <td>The Taliban’s rapid overthrow of the U.S.-supported regime in Afghanistan came as a surprise to many in the West, including President Biden, who said in early July: “Do I trust the Taliban? No. But I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped, and more and more competent in terms of conducting war.”<br />How could a ragtag group of religious fundamentalists be so effective in capturing a territory that has resisted rule by some of the most formidable world powers, including the British, the Soviets and the Americans?<br />An answer can be found in a quirky academic subfield known as the political economy of religion. It was developed in the late 1980s by sociologists Rodney Stark and Roger Finke and economist Laurence Iannaccone. Political scientists including Carolyn Warner and me added the political side of the equation in the early 1990s.<br />An insight from Mr. Iannaccone bears directly on the success of the Taliban: Groups with strict behavioral rituals are especially effective at organizing collective action. He was intrigued by the organizational vibrancy of some of the strictest faiths in the U.S., including Mormons, Jehovah’s Witnesses and Orthodox Jews. These groups all have demanding behavioral codes and intensely devoted adherents.<br />Mr. Iannaccone argued that behavioral codes like a prohibition on alcohol and stigmatizing behavior like wearing distinctive clothing enhanced cooperation. Religious organizations are “club goods,” wherein members share many collective benefits such as welfare provision and fellowship. Those benefits depend on active contribution. If everyone participates willingly, the organization is vibrant. If many members are free riders—receiving the benefits without pulling their weight—the quality of the good dissipates and the organization becomes anemic.</td>

      <td>Even Democrats and their media allies now acknowledge that the Biden administration’s handling of Afghanistan has been a debacle. The horrifying, heartbreaking pictures are impossible for Americans, our allies or our enemies to forget.<br />Set aside the question of whether the U.S. should have left. (I say no; Presidents Biden and Trump were both wrong in advocating withdrawal). Either way, it’s clear Mr. Biden didn’t plan even minimally for the secure evacuation of U.S. Embassy staff, American citizens or Afghan allies. It took until Wednesday for the administration to estimate how many Americans are in-country, offering a number which was far below previous reported estimates and that Secretary of State Antony Blinken still characterized as “likely to be out of date by the time we leave this briefing room” when he announced it to the press. The Biden administration’s execution of the Special Immigrant Visa program for Afghans who fought alongside us was a slow-moving disaster. It was also a grave betrayal.<br />There was clearly no close consultation with allies, no response to the Taliban’s moving to topple the Afghan government, and no plan to retrieve sophisticated U.S. war-fighting equipment. Inexplicably, what kept the Taliban in check—the threat of Americans flying out from Bagram Air Base to rain down hell—was among the first instruments of U.S. power to be withdrawn.<br />Our rivals—China, Russia and Iran—are gleefully demolishing any remaining American influence in the region, while our radical Islamist enemies are exulting at victory over the Great Satan and enjoying a huge recruiting boost.<br />This disaster has revealed grave structural weaknesses in the administration, from Mr. Biden to his White House staff to his cabinet.</td>

      <td>A crisis reveals a president with little introspection and even less penetration into the world’s problems.</td>
      <td>Joe Biden is the 46th U.S. president, the military’s commander in chief, leader of the free world. So why can’t I take him seriously? When he steps out to make a speech or give a rare press conference, he looks as if he is setting out to do a commercial to sell me gutters or roofing shingles. Mr. Biden strikes me as the Borax Man—a term from my Chicago youth for that slick salesman, whom you are always mistaken to allow in your house.<br />The Borax Man was a familiar type when I was growing up. So familiar that I dropped such a character, whom I named Sy Bourget, into a short story of mine called “Kaplan’s Big Deal.” In that story I wrote: “Bourget—he didn’t pronounce the t in his name—was so good, it used to be said, that he could sell aluminum siding to people who lived in high-rise buildings.” A main chancer, he studied human motives “toward the end of manipulating others to say yes.” Everyone, he believed, “was an operator, or at least wanted to be, and the only difference between people was that there were those who operated successfully and those who didn’t. Winners and losers, the old story.”<br />The problem Mr. Biden presents is that it is difficult to believe anything he says. The reason is that it is hard to believe that he himself really believes in much of anything, except getting ahead. As the American president—thanks to his good luck in having Donald Trump for an opponent—he has now surely accomplished this in excelsis.<br />Yet Mr. Biden lacks the convincing solemnity of manner, the gravitas that all world leaders, the fate of millions riding on their decisions, require. Instead he comes off as a man with little introspection and even less penetration into the problems facing the world. At a moment of crisis, these deficiencies carry grave consequences.<br />Belief on the part of a leader is of course conditional on the nature of the belief itself. George W. Bush, tutored by Dick Cheney, seems to have believed in nation building, which, as the example of Iraq has shown, wasn’t feasible. What does Joe Biden believe? He is a rosary-carrying Catholic who is all right with abortion, allowing politics to swamp theology. Having run for president as the centrist candidate, he straightaway proposed a slate of wildly progressive programs. Does he really believe in the efficacy of these programs, or has he decided he would like to inscribe himself in history as the 21st century’s Franklin D. Roosevelt? Can a man without discernible beliefs be counted on, say, to defend Israel or any other of America’s allies should the need arise? Who can say?</td>

      <td>A family memoir gets surprising reactions from Lithuanians, Russians and Jews.</td>
      <td>I grew up the proud granddaughter of a Lithuanian war hero who fought against communists. My grandfather, Jonas Noreika, has a school and streets named after him. When my mother, on her deathbed in 2000, asked me to write a story about her heroic father, I enthusiastically agreed.<br />Unfortunately, as I dug deeper, I discovered to my horror that my grandfather was also a Holocaust perpetrator involved in murdering at least 8,000 Jews. On my story’s release, Russians wanted to use me, Lithuanians vilified me, and Jews embraced me.<br />My grandfather wrote an order on Aug. 22, 1941 to send thousands of Jews to a ghetto in Zagere, where they were slaughtered. My family story has brought this to the forefront, toppling Lithuania’s image as an innocent bystander in the Holocaust.<br />As a result, Russian TV, radio, newspapers and even the press secretary from the Russian embassy in Washington begged me for interviews, promising an audience of millions. They gushed that my story was important because it overturns the heroic story of a Lithuanian partisan. I had to say no. The last thing any Lithuanian wants to hear is a lecture from the Russians on mistreating innocent people.<br />I became so paranoid about talking to Russians that I nearly missed a crucial interview with NBC News because its Lithuania-based stringer used a pseudonym that sounded Russian. I had deleted five or so emails from him out of fear. A mutual friend intervened to assure me the reporter worked for NBC.</td>

      <td>Reading Locke and Rousseau to determine how best to ensure that our children think for themselves—and not simply follow the crowd.</td>
      <td>My childhood school in Toronto is developing an “anti-racism and pluralism strategy.” In an update to alumni, the institution acknowledged “systemic forms of oppression in our school community” and pledged to create “an environment where the visibility, the strength and voices of the BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and People of Colour) community is actively cultivated, mentored and promoted through equitable admissions, a diverse curriculum, and hiring of diverse faculty.” Icons, traditions and monuments will all be reassessed.<br />The school claims it is leading the way forward. In fact, it is following, catching up to the ritzy American schools and adopting the fashion of our day. If administrators think this makes them good liberals, they are mistaken—or at least the founders of modern liberalism would say so. As Rita Koganzon demonstrates in her valuable book “Liberal States, Authoritarian Families,” key early liberal theorists relied on parents and teachers to steel children against “the worst tendencies of liberalism—the tendencies to be ruled by fashions, custom, and the opinions of the majority.”<br />John Locke, the father of liberalism, sought to divide and limit the authority of the state, but he strengthened the authority of parents to act in the best interests of their children. While championing liberty and tolerance, Locke, no relativist, knew they “threatened to make wrong opinions more powerful by removing all the social mechanisms that had previously suppressed them, leaving the highly susceptible minds of children especially exposed.” Since the state can’t safely or effectively shield citizens from error and direct them to better ideas, Locke gave the authority to parents and teachers.<br />Ms. Koganzon, who teaches politics at the University of Virginia, points out that Locke wanted children to learn habits of skepticism and reflection, preparing them to later resist erroneous intellectual fashions. “Lockean education,” Ms. Koganzon argues, “is thus more accurately understood as a corrective for the excesses of liberalism than as an assembly line for compliant subjects.”<br />In “Some Thoughts Concerning Education,” Locke does not advise indoctrinating children in the “right” ideas. Instead, he sets out a plan for what Ms. Koganzon terms “an individualistic training of the mind.” Locke believed that “men firmly embrace falsehood for truth” because they never learned to “contest the empire of habit,” which would allow them to question their beliefs. Accordingly, “where habit insinuates itself naturally, Locke directs parents to break it, but where it does not, he enjoins them to introduce it.” Denial is the first step to self-denial and then to self-mastery.</td>

      <td><br /><br /><br />When the self-titled debut album from Big Red Machine dropped in 2018, it was received as yet another side project from Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon. The honey-voiced singer-songwriter has always stayed busy with groups outside of his main band. And this one, a partnership with Aaron Dessner of the National, wasn’t too far afield from Mr. Vernon’s expressive indie rock, which combines rustic instrumentation and electronic processing. But in the three years since, Big Red Machine has turned into something else. “How Long Do You Think It’s Gonna Last?” (37D03D/Jagjaguwar), the new BRM record, out Friday, is clearly a showcase for Mr. Dessner’s production, songwriting and—for the first time—his voice. Big Red Machine is essentially a collective—Mr. Vernon’s contributions are still prominent, and others in Mr. Dessner’s orbit sing lead and co-write—but here Mr. Dessner is the center of gravity.<br />Mr. Dessner is a low-key personality most comfortable in a supporting role. In 2020, his profile raised significantly thanks to his collaborations with Taylor Swift. She released two No. 1 albums in 2020—“Folklore” in July, which won a Grammy for Album of the Year, and “Evermore” in December—and Mr. Dessner co-wrote and co-produced both. Compared to the danceable beats found on her three previous records and the radio-ready country-pop she started with, these LPs were quiet and reflective. They were created from a distance during the pandemic-induced lockdown, and they captured the inward focus of the moment.</td>

      <td>A Michigan militia member was sentenced to six years and three months in prison after he pleaded guilty to taking part in a plot to kidnap the state’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, over her response to the coronavirus pandemic, a federal judge determined Wednesday.<br />Ty Garbin, a 25-year-old airplane mechanic, is the only member of the group known as the Wolverine Watchmen to plead guilty in the alleged plot. He faced up to life in prison for his plea to one count of kidnapping conspiracy. Federal prosecutors had recommended he receive nine years because of his acceptance of guilt and cooperation in the investigation as well as his plans to testify against his alleged co-conspirators.<br />“It’s hard to overstate how significant Mr. Garbin’s cooperation was here,” Nils R. Kessler, Assistant United States Attorney, told Chief Judge Robert J. Jonker, of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan. “Having somebody who’s part of this agreement say this wasn’t just big talk, we really meant to do it is a huge thing and it’s going to be important to the jury when he testifies.”<br />Mr. Garbin’s lawyers argued for six years, citing his history of abuse by his father and his cooperation with the government, among other things.<br />In a brief statement in court, Mr. Garbin apologized to Ms. Whitmer and her family. “I can’t even begin to imagine the amount of stress and fear her family members felt because of my actions,” he said, adding that he planned to work with groups that aim to deradicalize others.</td>

Many lack passports or other reliable identification documents.<br />Already there have been issues. French and German authorities said this week they had flagged several evacuees as security risks, with France putting five of them under surveillance.<br />A bigger challenge looms as Afghans traveling by land routes are expected to reach the continent in what officials expect to be much larger numbers.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler named an outspoken investor-protection advocate to his inner circle of advisers Wednesday, the latest sign he is gearing up to take a more adversarial approach toward Wall Street.<br />Mr. Gensler appointed Barbara Roper, longtime director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, to serve as a senior adviser focused on policy issues, broker-dealer oversight, investment-adviser oversight and examinations.<br />“Barb is a champion for investors and will provide invaluable counsel on behalf of the American public,” Mr. Gensler said in a statement. He said he has worked with Ms. Roper on landmark Wall Street reform projects dating back to the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley overhaul of public-company accounting rules, as well as the Dodd-Frank Act passed in 2010 following the global financial crisis. “I’m thrilled to collaborate with her again at the SEC.”<br />A prolific writer of comment letters seeking to influence SEC policy—she has sent more than 100 to the agency dating back to 1990—Ms. Roper has frequently sided against banks, brokers, hedge funds and private-equity firms on regulatory issues. She was at times harshly critical of Mr. Gensler’s predecessor Jay Clayton, a Wall Street deals lawyer whom she characterized as too close to the financial industry.<br />After the 2020 election, Ms. Roper called for President Biden to nominate a candidate for SEC chair who wouldn’t shy away from adopting strong rules over opposition from industry and dissenting votes from the pair of Republicans on the SEC’s five-member panel.</td>

The missions are using American military helicopters but under the control of the CIA, a typical arrangement in such operations.<br />A congressional source knowledgeable about the evacuation effort said U.S. troops had gone into Kabul on joint missions with other foreign allies, including Britain and France, to designated locations where they had picked up citizens from all those nations, U.S. green-card holders, and Afghans who hold special visas for helping the U.S. military.<br />The air and ground operations are considered perilous under the current circumstances in the country as the U.S. has begun to assign priority on evacuating Americans over Afghans who are at risk. Those include the many thousands of Afghan interpreters and others who worked for the U.S. government but remain inside the country and face retribution from the Taliban.<br />The Pentagon has said it is coordinating with the Taliban on airport security, but it’s unclear if those discussions also included extraction missions.</td>

He was convicted of killing nine Black churchgoers in 2015 at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston after planning the attack for months, writing a racist manifesto and purchasing a .45-caliber Glock pistol with 88 rounds, representing a numerical sign for “Heil Hitler,” according to prosecutors.<br />Roof appealed his conviction in early 2020. At the time, his lawyers argued he shouldn’t have represented himself during his trial while suffering from schizophrenia, autism, anxiety and depression. In their appeal, the attorneys said Roof didn’t take his conviction seriously “because white nationalists would free him from prison after an impending race war.”</td>

One Capitol Police officer who was sprayed with a chemical substance during the attack died the following day of natural causes, according to the District of Columbia medical examiner.<br />Four law-enforcement officers who responded to the attack have since died by suicide.</td>

But it committed to evacuating Afghans until operations conclude, without saying when they would end or when the final military withdrawal would commence.<br />“We will have to reserve some capacity in those last couple of days to prioritize the military footprint leaving because we want to be able to keep it there as long as possible to do the job it is intended to do,” Pentagon spokesman John Kirby told reporters Wednesday.<br />In a sign of the shift, Turkey began evacuating its soldiers from Afghanistan, the Defense Ministry said on Wednesday.

Western Digital would pay for the deal with stock and the combined company would likely be run by its Chief Executive, David Goeckeler, the people said.<br />There’s no guarantee Western Digital, which had a market value of around $19 billion Wednesday afternoon, will seal an agreement, and Kioxia could still opt for an initial public offering it had been planning or another combination.<br />The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Western Digital and  Micron Technology Inc.  were examining potential deals with Kioxia, which makes NAND flash-memory chips used in smartphones, computer servers and other devices. Micron’s interest has since cooled and Kioxia has been focused on discussions with Western Digital, which already has deep existing ties with the Japanese company.<br />Any transaction would require the blessing of the Japanese government, given Kioxia’s significance there and the political sensitivities of transferring ownership of such key technology. Washington would also likely play a role, but a deal could fit with a push by the U.S. to boost its chipmaking capabilities and increase competitiveness with China.</td>

Until now, many employers had used incentives such as cash bonuses to motivate workers to get vaccinated, or have mandated vaccinations.<br />Delta’s approach instead focuses on the financial burden of Covid-19 and aims to transfer it to those resisting vaccination. Studies show vaccination greatly reduces the risk of severe disease or death from the disease.<br />The $200 monthly charge for unvaccinated workers enrolled in Delta’s healthcare plan “will be necessary to address the financial risk the decision to not vaccinate is creating for our company,” Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian wrote to employees Wednesday.<br />Mr. Bastian put a price on the lack of vaccination, saying the additional charge will help to cover hospital stays that are more likely for unvaccinated people infected with Covid-19—something that he said can cost the company as much as $50,000 a person. In recent weeks, all Delta employees who have been hospitalized with Covid-19 weren’t fully vaccinated, Mr. Bastian said.</td>

      <td>Sporting merch can be like a secret handshake among discerning wine drinkers. And you can learn a lot about a winery from the slogan and the thread count it selects.</td>
      <td>WINE DRINKERS, I’ve decided, are of two types: those who wear winery T-shirts and those who do not. Up to now, I have always belonged to the second group.<br />While I’ve visited plenty of wineries and purchased plenty of wine, I’ve never been tempted to buy winery-branded merchandise, aka “merch.” But after talking to winemakers, I’ve come to see the winery T-shirt in particular as a sort of barometer. A winemaker who is thoughtful about shirt quality and design is likely to approach winemaking just as thoughtfully.<br />One of the shirts I purchased for this column came from Matthiasson Wines in Napa, Calif., whose wines I’ve long admired and whose proprietor and winemaker, Steve Matthiasson, describes himself as “a T-shirt guy.”<br />His winery’s T-shirt ($24) simply features a pair of pruning shears and the Matthiasson name—understated, much like the wines he makes. Also like Matthiasson’s wines, the shirt is made in an environmentally friendly fashion—half organic cotton, half recycled polyester. Mr. Matthiasson had more to say in a follow-up email: “Most [people] have never heard of Matthiasson and don’t recognize our logo…but if they know us, they enjoy seeing that one of our fans is as geeky about wine as they are.”<br />Debbie Hansen and her winemaker husband, Leo Hansen, of Leo Steen Wines in Healdsburg, Calif., specialize in small-production Chenin Blanc (the grape known as Steen in South Africa). They also produce a shirt with a simple design ($30), mostly for their wine club members and tasting room visitors. “We only make 50-75 shirts each year,” said Ms. Hansen. But the shirt’s slogan, “Drink Chenin,” gets noticed; it caught my eye on Instagram.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The intraparty fracas over passing a $3.5 trillion budget outline has left Democrats girding for an even more difficult set of negotiations this fall as progressives and centrists begin sparring on the details of their broad healthcare, education and climate plan.<br />The dayslong standoff between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and a group of centrist Democrats centered on the timing of advancing the budget outline and a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure plan, with the moderate lawmakers unsuccessfully demanding a vote on the public-works plan before the $3.5 trillion outline. After striking a deal, House Democrats approved the budget resolution on Tuesday, and party leaders said they would bring up the infrastructure bill by Sept. 27 while also working to quickly finalize the second package.<br />Not only will Democrats face the same dispute over sequencing in the fall, as progressives still push for the $3.5 trillion bill to come up before infrastructure, but they will also have to come to terms on the scores of policy questions they hope to tackle in the bill—a process that could ultimately take months. Democrats will rely on narrow majorities in the House and Senate to try to muscle into law a package that includes an expansion of Medicare as well as universal prekindergarten and antipoverty measures—along with tax increases on companies and high-income households.<br />“The challenge of the bill this fall is not to have this kind of cliffhanger, but to work it out and accommodate people,” said Rep. David Price (D., N.C.). “It’s tough given our narrow majority and given the range of views. It’s not going to be easy to figure out what the sweet spot is, but if we’re going to succeed that’s what we gotta do.”<br />The tug of war over the timing of voting on the infrastructure and budget plans reflects mutual skepticism between the moderates and progressives of the Democratic Party.</td>

But having the 100-amp line—the standard household outlet is 15 or 20 amps—served the couple well as they expanded their fleet of electric vehicles, which now includes a Tesla Model 3, Model S and Roadster.<br />Around 2016, the Van Deerlins added a second Tesla wall connector and a NEMA 1450 outlet, which can be used to charge any electric vehicle. They also amped up the decor in their garage so that it would be “suitably nice” for the cars, said Dr. Van Deerlin. She said they spent around $13,000 for Tesla-colored paint, a wall-mounted metal logo and decorative floor tiles.<br />Dr. Van Deerlin, who is president of a local club for Tesla owners, said she was an early adopter of driving electric for environmental reasons but fell in love with the car. “I love that driving electric doesn’t need to be a compromise,” she said.</td>

Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, is the main decision maker on all major strategic issues, including the nuclear deal.<br />Mr. Amir-Abdollahian was first promoted into the government under hard-line former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Political analysts note his close ties to Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including its former foreign forces leader, Qassem Soleimani, killed by the U.S. in 2020.<br />However, Western officials also say Mr. Amir-Abdollahian, 57 years old, is a pragmatist who has dealt directly with U.S. officials before. He was one of several Iranian diplomats involved in talks on the security situation in Iraq with U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker in 2007.</td>

Sadly, as Mr. Jackson points out, this is apparently not the view shared by the nation’s senior naval officers and their political masters.<br />Vice Adm. John Nowell Jr., the chief of navy personnel, has reinstated the officer photo requirement, allowing promotion- and command-selection boards to factor in skin color to their decisions. During my time in service, active and reserve, this requirement came and went at least twice with no explanation. Most officers believed it was related to some ill-defined diversity agenda.<br />I saw this firsthand while a uniformed military instructor at the U.S. Naval Academy from 2007-10 through the matriculation of some midshipmen who should have never been admitted to a rigorous program designed to develop naval officers. Adm. Mike Mullen, then-chief of naval operations, stated in 2006 that “diversity is a strategic imperative.” His successor, Adm. Gary Roughead, developed and implemented a Navy-wide diversity policy. Merit becomes untenable in a system no longer defined by standards of individual achievement. The system, governed by two standards, will lose credibility, and the erosion of impartiality will inevitably weaken it. As Mr. Jackson notes, our sons and daughters will suffer from this Sisyphean policy of elevating diversity above merit.<br />The promotion-selection process is already opaque and not altogether objective. Blatantly and proudly factoring in race will erode confidence further. More good officers will leave the service. Once the directive becomes codified, the pressures on promotion boards will be immense and important attributes will be sacrificed at the altar of diversity and “equity.” If we keep to this course, we’ll soon find that our military officers are not as capable as we’d wish of confronting threats across the globe.<br />Lt.

In 2013, nearly 20% of Congress received a government pension alongside a congressional salary, but this practice isn’t limited to Congress. Its benefits can be enjoyed by many government employees.<br />Washington doesn’t live by the same rules and under the same conditions as average Americans. The Biden administration feels that it can throw money at everything without consequence, and that’s because there is none for them—only the upside of more votes. It’s the taxpayer who will foot the bill and struggle to live within a budget, not the government.

      <td>One in three U.S. bridges needs repair or replacement, and most of the money will be spent after 2022.</td>
      <td>In “The Trillion-Dollar Infrastructure Bill Will Fuel Inflation” (op-ed, Aug. 9), Stephen Miran argues that newly funded road construction will cause more traffic congestion, leading to higher inflation. That’s a head-scratcher.<br />The real issue is U.S. transportation system performance. By most measurements, it is failing from decades of insufficient investment, and the American people are paying the price. One in three U.S. bridges needs repair or replacement. The backlog of economically-beneficial highway and bridge projects is $786 billion and projected to reach $2.7 trillion over 20 years. Motorists lost an average of 97 hours annually to congestion, costing $87 billion in 2018, or $1,348 per driver, according to the analytics company Inrix.<br />Transportation improvements are initiated to reduce traffic gridlock, improve safety or increase the movement of people and products. Postponing needed investments only compounds costs down the road.<br />Most economists believe current inflationary pressures are temporary. American Action Forum President Douglas Holtz-Eakin and American Enterprise Institute director of economic policy studies Michael Strainwrite, “Improving roads, bridges, and ports would make it less costly for businesses to operate, allowing them to increase their output per hour, and putting downward pressure on consumer prices.”<br />Since most of the money in the Senate infrastructure plan will be spent after 2022, they add, “We expect inflationary pressures from President Biden’s February stimulus, reopening, and pandemic-related supply constraints to have abated by 2023. So spending under the infrastructure plan would overwhelmingly occur after current concerns about inflation have subsided.”</td>

The court also is considering whether to lift a federal public-health ban on evictions.<br />Welcome to what court watchers have deemed the “shadow docket” of the Supreme Court, where the justices throughout the year entertain emergency applications seeking their intervention. Here’s how this process works.<br />The high court hears about 70 cases a year, and there are clear and transparent procedures for deciding them. But the justices also make other types of decisions behind the scenes, including on emergency appeals. The shadow docket is an informal name for that body of work.<br />The court’s rules allow for the filing of emergency requests by litigants who believe they have been seriously wronged by a lower court.

At sister restaurant Fore Street, he either slowly braises or spit-roasts leg of lamb over live coals.<br />When cooking off the clock, however, Mr. Eliot goes about things quite differently. In his second Slow Food Fast recipe, he calls for seasoning butterflied leg of lamb with salt and pepper and simply searing it in a heavy pan. (You can also quickly grill it.) In just a few minutes, the exterior crisps and caramelizes, while the interior cooks to medium. “You do it like a steak,” Mr. Eliot said. “You want this a nice pink.”<br />While the meat rests, stir up a sauté of summer vegetables with red wine and anchovies—a luxurious, sweet-savory bed for the sliced lamb. With a really nice piece of lamb, you don’t need a whole lot of fanfare. “This is something I’d do at home with friends,” said Mr. Eliot.

      <td>It would strain the program’s finances and reduce the quality of care.</td>
      <td>Moderate Democrats like Sens. John Breaux of Louisiana and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska once favored gradually raising the Medicare eligibility age to help ensure the program’s financial sustainability. But few of them are left in Congress. Today the “moderate” Democratic position is that the eligibility age should be lowered as an alternative to establishing a single-payer system. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders also favors opening Medicare to everyone over 60, but as a step toward single payer.<br />The Democrats’ $3.5 trillion Senate budget plan allows the final legislation to lower the eligibility age. President Biden’s budget also endorses the plan, which would cost $200 billion over 10 years and add more than 20 million younger sexagenarians to the 63 million seniors and disabled beneficiaries who already rely on the program. It would also worsen the program’s finances, unnecessarily replace private dollars with tax dollars, and hurt doctors and other providers of medical services.<br />Medicare’s Part A trust fund, which pays for hospital benefits, is already projected to be insolvent by 2026. Even without expansion, Medicare spending is projected nearly to double over the next 10 years. Congress’s first priority should be to strengthen the program’s finances so that vulnerable seniors can continue to access life-saving health care.<br />Democrats claim expanding Medicare is necessary to reduce the number of uninsured Americans. But lowering Medicare’s eligibility age is an inefficient way to accomplish that. Two-thirds of Americans 60 to 64 already have private coverage through an employer or the individual market. The plan could move as many as 11.7 million people with employer coverage and 2.4 million people with individual coverage onto Medicare’s rolls, shifting the bill to taxpayers without expanding coverage. Only 8% of the newly eligible population, or 1.6 million people, are currently uninsured. Two-thirds are already eligible for Medicaid or exchange subsidies, 15% have access to employer-provided coverage, and 7% are illegal aliens ineligible for Medicare.<br />Private payers pay substantially higher rates to hospitals and physicians, in some cases as much as doubling Medicare’s hospital rates. Expanding government coverage at the expense of private coverage will make it harder for providers to continue shifting costs to higher-paying private patients. The result will be longer lines, less care, and decreased incentive for innovation in treatment and care.</td>

      <td>The U.N. Security Council could authorize the U.S. and allies to enforce a safe zone for evacuations.</td>
      <td>President Biden seems to have set a trap for himself—and for Americans, allied personnel and Afghans seeking to leave Afghanistan. Those civilians were stranded after Mr. Biden withdrew U.S. troops only to be surprised by the Taliban’s quick takeover. Mr. Biden promised to evacuate them by Aug. 31, and the Taliban said they’d hold him to that deadline. On Monday the administration signaled that it intends to abide by it. It won’t be enough time.<br />Yet there’s a way out. The administration should immediately propose a United Nations Security Council resolution calling on the Taliban to guarantee safe and unimpeded access to the airport.<br />While Chinese and Russian officials have missed few opportunities to criticize the U.S. withdrawal, Beijing and Moscow might be reluctant to oppose such a measure. Vetoing a resolution like this would give each a share of responsibility for a humanitarian crisis that they could otherwise attribute to Washington, and would demonstrate to U.S. allies where China’s and Russia’s leaders stand. Moreover, unlike past resolutions on Syria and Libya that the two governments blocked, a safe-evacuation resolution need not include authorization for U.S. or other outside forces to enter Afghanistan, since they are already there, or for combat operations.<br />A Security Council resolution would aid efforts to expand the existing safe zone the U.S. military has established at Kabul’s airport and create corridors for evacuees trying to reach it—essential steps for bringing them under American and allied protection. Allowing crowds and chaos to grow at the limited access points to the airport is dangerous. A single terrorist bomb at one of these points could kill tens or hundreds of Afghans as well as U.S. military personnel and evacuees. This would further slow processing of evacuees, trap more civilians, and prevent some Afghans from leaving, keeping them at risk of retaliation and helping the Taliban to limit the brain drain, bad publicity and other consequences of their visible flight.<br />The U.S. needs to be unwavering in setting up a safe zone and should use maximum force if the Taliban interfere. The U.S. military can inflict grave damage on the Taliban’s forces in Kabul and elsewhere, weakening their ability to fight non-Pashtun groups that already reject Taliban rule and continue to resist in the Panjshir Valley and beyond. Washington has considerable economic, diplomatic and other leverage too—especially in concert with and in support of allies.</td>

      <td>TEL AVIV—Since taking over in June as Israel’s prime minister, Naftali Bennett has tried to construct a new political order. The biggest obstacle might be the man he displaced, his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.<br />Mr. Bennett, a right-wing politician who will be in Washington this week to meet President Joe Biden, heads an unstable coalition of leftist, right-wing and Arab parties and by necessity must govern from the center.<br />He has tried to call every minister each week to ask how they are, according to coalition members. His tweets add the handles of other ministers to congratulate them on the government’s work, which is studiously avoiding tackling contentious issues head on. He’s turned to private sector experts on the coronavirus and other issues, asking for ideas via WhatsApp.<br />In a video published on Twitter this month, Mr. Bennett and members of each coalition party urged people to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, regardless of political affiliation.<br />Mr. Bennett’s coalition accomplished what no other opponent of Mr. Netanyahu could over the past 12 years—it drove him from power. The political survival of the 49-year-old prime minister depends on winning enough votes beyond his traditional constituency to continue to lead. At stake is moving the country past a divisive and turbulent political period, with four elections in two years</td>

It also began rescinding or changing the assignment of some new job offers, citing business uncertainty, these people said. London’s Telegraph newspaper earlier reported Didi’s plans to halt its plans in the U.K. and Europe.<br />Chinese officials are conducting a cybersecurity investigation of the Beijing-based company, a probe that sank Didi’s stock value days after its U.S. initial public offering in June.<br />Earlier this month, three British Parliament members raised concerns that the Chinese government could use Didi to harvest data from Brits using the service.</td>

Mr. Rajkovic, who goes by Sholim, had watched NFTs take over the art world, but he had never toyed with them. Horrified, he pulled up the platform OpenSea and found an impostor trying to sell off 122 of his works as NFTs for as much as $50,000 combined.<br />“People are getting robbed,” Mr. Rajkovic said. The phony page disappeared at one point, but another version has since popped up. “I feel responsible, because they love my work and someone is using me to steal from them. It’s so frustrating.”<br />NFTs are supercharging the art market, but users warn they have a dark side. Scammers and hackers are increasingly exploiting security gaps in the rapidly expanding marketplace—and artists and collectors who aren’t crypto-literate are proving easy marks, cyber-defense experts say.<br />Around $2.4 billion worth of NFTs traded in the second quarter, slightly up from the $2.3 billion sold during the initial NFT art frenzy of the first quarter, according to digital analytics firm DappRadar. Major auction houses and galleries now sell NFT art—Beeple’s $69 million NFT still holds the record—and dozens of online art-selling platforms are sprouting up seeking artists and collectors to join the NFT art craze. NFTs are digital vouchers of authenticity that can be attached to images on screens, allowing JPEGs be traded and tracked indefinitely on the blockchain.<br />Common frauds include creating phony NFT artworks and fake platforms that purportedly sell art but actually steal credit-card information. There are also phishing schemes and viruses that can drain users’ digital wallets, or online accounts that can store people’s financial details and cryptocurrency wealth.</td>

As of July 31, just $4.7 billion had been distributed to landlords and tenants, the Treasury said.<br />Wednesday’s data show that rental aid has begun to move faster in some states, though July’s $1.7 billion reflected only a modest overall increase from the $1.5 billion distributed in June.<br />While the program is overseen by the Treasury, it relies on a patchwork of more than 450 state, county and municipal governments and charitable organizations to distribute aid. The result: months of delays as local governments built new programs from scratch, hired staff and crafted rules for how the money should be distributed, then struggled to process a deluge of applications.<br />Administration officials acknowledge the program has moved too slowly relative to the need. Still, they say it has provided nearly one million payments to households, including about 341,000 in July alone—an indication that it has provided meaningful relief to struggling tenants.</td>

This will allow Moscow to export directly to Germany and bypass Ukraine and Poland, whose governments are critical of Moscow.<br />The U.S. fears Russia will use Nord Stream 2 to wield influence over Europe and punish pro-Western Ukraine and other countries that the pipeline circumvents by depriving them of the transit fees they charge on Europe-bound Russian gas, raising gas prices or potentially starving them of gas altogether.

      <td>Record label’s stock has lagged behind even as consumers are paying up for music</td>
      <td>This column is part of the Heard on the Street stock-picking contest. You’re invited to play along with us here.<br />The nice thing about being  Warner Music  these days is that the company still does well even when listeners go old school.<br />Streaming is now the main driver of the music business, accounting for about 83% of the industry’s $12.2 billion in U.S. revenue last year, according to data from the Recording Industry Association of America, or RIAA. But the industry is also seeing a strong uptick in sales of vinyl albums, which generated nearly $620 million in U.S. sales last year—up 29% from the previous year. That is the highest sales figure for the vinyl format in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1988.<br />It is all good news for Warner. As still the only pure-play record label on the public market, Warner offers investors exposure across the music industry’s various distribution channels. Most of that is from streaming; digital recorded music and digital publishing made up more than two-thirds of the company’s $3.9 billion in revenue for the nine-month period ended June 30. But as Tim Nollen of Macquarie put it, Warner is “having it both ways” of late. Vinyl demand powered a 155% surge in physical music sales to $130 million in the company’s fiscal third quarter ended June.<br />The music business has been on an upswing overall, with revenue growing by double digits annually over the past five years, according to RIAA data. That follows years of falling sales brought about by piracy and shrinking demand for CDs—the industry’s former cash cow. Streaming has powered the bulk of those gains, but videogaming and even home-based exercise are also new growth drivers. Peloton says music royalties are the largest variable cost item of the company’s $1.9 billion in subscription cost of revenue for the nine-month period ended in March. Roblox, the massively popular videogame platform that also hosts virtual album launches and live concerts, got an equity investment from Warner Music earlier this year before its initial public offering in March.</td>

The government is also compelling 300,000 federal employees to get shots, as well as employees of airlines and railways.<br />Two days later, Mr. Trudeau called elections to Canada’s Parliament for Sept. 20. Surveys show strong public support for vaccine mandates in Canada except among supporters of Mr. Trudeau’s conservative opponents, who are divided on the issue.<br />A campaign against the unvaccinated could benefit Mr. Trudeau by attracting new voters and shoring up his declining lead in opinion polls ahead of the elections while sowing discord among his right-leaning adversaries.<br />Unlike in the U.S., Canada’s major political parties and regional governments have mostly worked in unison to mitigate the pandemic’s fallout, with some success.</td>

Witnesses on the ground said the Taliban had begun blocking roads.

Tom Malinowski (D., N.J.).<br />Mr. Biden has said the buck stops with him for the situation in Afghanistan, and the White House said he had been forthright with the public on the challenges there.

These are targeting once-hot companies like electric truck maker  Nikola Corp. , which class-action suits claim defrauded investors.<br />So far this year, there have been 19 of these more typical class-action lawsuits concerning SPACs filed in federal court. Five were filed in all of 2020, according to insurance brokerage Woodruff Sawyer & Co. In 2019, before the SPAC boom lit up the markets, there were two suits.<br />SPACs were a more popular target for federal class-action lawsuits in the first half of this year than other hot-button litigation areas, such as Covid-19 or cryptocurrencies, according to consulting firm Cornerstone Research.</td>

Wednesday’s findings are expected to inform the U.S. booster strategy set to begin in September, when the U.S. plans to begin offering boosters to people who received messenger-RNA vaccines. Later it is likely to expand the program to include J&J’s viral-vector vaccine.<br />J&J said researchers found antibody levels increased ninefold among people who received a second dose of its vaccine, compared with one month after they received a first dose. The company didn’t specify exactly when or how many subjects received the second dose, though information posted about the clinical trial in an online government database indicates it was administered six months after the first shot.<br />J&J said that it will submit data from two studies to a preprint server, meaning that the data haven’t been peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal.<br />The company said researchers observed significant increases in antibody responses in participants between ages 18 and 55 and in those 65 and older who received a lower booster dose.</td>

      <td>The former stock-market darling still has a market value of $10 billion, which is a lot to take on little but hope and trust</td>
      <td>This column is part of the Heard on the Street Stock Picking Contest. You’re invited to play along with us here.<br />As a black-box company in a technical industry, battery startup  QuantumScape  was always an unlikely investor darling. Chances that it can revive the early hype around its early-stage technology seem slim.<br />The company, which went public last fall via a special-purpose acquisition company, says it has hit on a wonder material that could, based on initial testing, enable the manufacture of “solid state” batteries with pure lithium anodes. This would be a breakthrough innovation, extending battery range, supporting fast charging and reducing costs. Electric vehicles might finally be as cheap and easy to fill with power as today’s gas ones.<br />QuantumScape became a stock-market sensation, with a strong following among individual investors. Valued at $3.3 billion in the deal that brought it to market, the company reached a peak enterprise value of more than $30 billion as 2021 dawned, according to FactSet (more, factoring in stock options and other forms of share issuance).<br />A steadily falling share price has since brought that number back to about $7.3 billion. Even that is out of kilter with peers. Solid Power, another solid-state startup, agreed to merge with a SPAC in June at an enterprise value of $1.2 billion. British peer Ilika is capitalized at less than $300 million.</td>

      <td>After suffering through stock selloffs this summer, China’s internet giants are working hard to regain favor with authorities and global investors as the companies try to chart paths back to normalcy.<br />Shares of two large Chinese online retailers,  Pinduoduo Inc.  and  JD.com Inc.,  jumped more than 20% in the past two days—recouping a chunk of their heavy losses since July—after the companies reported healthy sales increases in the second quarter and highlighted their contributions to Chinese society. Their performance took some of the focus away from Beijing’s widening regulatory crackdown, which has turned many investors off to once-hot internet sector.<br />Pinduoduo, a fast-growing e-commerce player known for selling vegetables, groceries and household essentials, reported on Tuesday  net income of $373.9 million for the three months ended June. It was the Shanghai-based company’s first net profit since its listing on the  Nasdaq Stock Market  about three years ago and came on the back of an 89% jump in quarterly revenue to $13.6 billion.<br />The nearly six-year-old company said it would commit its second-quarter earnings and future profit totaling up to the equivalent of $1.5 billion to supporting farmers and rural communities by helping them modernize using agricultural technology. Chen Lei, its chairman and chief executive, said he would oversee the project, which needs majority shareholder approval.<br />Days earlier,  Tencent Holdings Ltd.  said it would invest the equivalent of $7.7 billion to promote “common prosperity” in China. The videogaming and social-media giant previously had earmarked a similar sum to fund research in areas such as science and carbon neutrality that are strategically important to Beijing. Common prosperity has become a popular catchphrase in China, used to describe President Xi Jinping’s desire for people in the country to get rich together, instead of having wealth concentrated among the corporate world’s upper echelons.</td>

Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average also saw tepid moves. Contracts tied to the technology-heavy Nasdaq-100 edged up 0.1%.<br />Investors say they are holding off on any big new bets going into the end of the week because they are awaiting fresh insights from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at the central bank’s Jackson Hole symposium Friday. Money managers are torn over whether the Fed will proceed with scaling back its bond purchases in coming months, given the uptick in Covid-19 cases and some signs that the economic recovery is slowing.<br />“It is wait-and-see because we’re getting to the point where we think we’ll get some definitive information on tapering,” said Daniel Morris, chief market strategist at BNP Paribas Asset Management. “On one hand, we’ve had the signaling on tapering, but on the flip side, you see people looking at a deceleration in activity.”<br />Markets are also weighing a mix of other factors. Regulatory approval of  Pfizer  and BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine has spurred some businesses to impose vaccination mandates, potentially boosting the pace of the U.S. rollout. Meanwhile, concerns over the duration of vaccines’ efficacy has caused some investors to expect that the global economic recovery could falter.</td>

      <td>This year has been disappointing for biotech investors, but Pfizer’s planned acquisition of Trillium Therapeutics shows things aren’t as bleak as they seem</td>
      <td>Can the acquisition of a small biotech company help turn around a disappointing year for the entire sector?<br />The question is worth asking after  Pfizer  announced a buyout of  Trillium Therapeutics ,  a developer of cancer drugs, for $2.26 billion in cash. That price is more than three times Trillium’s market value as of last Friday. A broad index of small and midsize biotech companies rallied more than 4% on Monday.<br />That burst of euphoria was badly needed for a sector that has struggled even as most growth stocks are thriving. The biotech index is still down about 9% so far this year and has shed nearly 30% from February’s record.<br />There are clear reasons for that soggy performance. The lingering Covid-19 pandemic has been a bonanza for vaccine developers, but delays in routine care for most patients have resulted in fewer new prescriptions and a slower pace of clinical-trial enrollment.<br />Regulatory concerns aren’t helping matters. Budgetary negotiations in Congress could potentially lead to tougher regulations on prescription-drug prices. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has yet to nominate a full-time commissioner for the Food and Drug Administration.</td>

Who better to understand the journey than an acclaimed Hollywood filmmaker?<br />Barry Jenkins, Oscar-winning writer, director and producer, is also a proud aviation geek with a strong Twitter following among travelers. He reposts turbulence maps, comments on strange routes that airplanes take around storms and even gives advice on travel bags.<br />His eye is far more discerning than the average road warrior’s. He’ll call out the perfect seat-height-to-window ratio on a plane and the worst layout of business-class cabins (seats angled with a passenger’s back to the window). Sometimes he becomes so fascinated with how light plays with clouds that he’ll make a short video, set it to the music he’s listening to and share it on  Twitter .<br />“Being in a plane at 30,000 feet, you get views that human beings just physically are not meant to get. I want to look out the damn window. I want to look out the window the entire time,” Mr. Jenkins says.<br />Social media has become a way for transportation companies to communicate with customers and for road warriors to alert others to problems or offer tips and tricks. It’s also a good way to get the attention of airlines—they often respond faster to problems aired publicly than they do regular customer complaints. It’s even the best way to get help from the Transportation Security Administration.</td>

      <td>We take sides on whether high-tech luxury chairs—with artificial intelligence, ‘brain massage’ tech and undulating air bags—can soothe you as effectively as a licenced massage therapist</td>
      <td>For the recurring series, That’s Debatable, we take on a contentious issue of the day and present two spirited arguments—one in favor and the other emphatically opposed. Previous installments from the series are here.<br />Like many frequent business travelers, Bryan Eisenberg often passed the time before takeoff browsing the gadgets and gizmos in airport Brookstone stores. On a good day, the Austin-based consultant and author even managed to sneak in a spa break, courtesy of one of the store’s iconic jumbo massage chairs. Purchasing one became a long-running “one of these days” joke between him and his brother. When the pandemic curtailed both travel and access to massage therapists, Mr. Eisenberg finally stopped joking and bought a high-tech Daiwa Symphony massage chair with undulating air bags, triple reflexology rollers and a list price of $10,000. (He paid considerably less at a warehouse sale.)<br />Though he initially considered the elaborately soothing seat an indulgence, he soon came to see it as a bargain. “I’m pretty sure we’ve come close to paying it back already, not even a year in,” he said, based on his rough calculation of how much the time that he, his wife and three kids aged 12-to-20 have spent in the chair would cost at a typical rate for massage therapy.<br />Makers of ultramodern massage chairs are engaged in an arms (and back and neck) race to find new, and sometimes esoteric ways to attract, unknot and de-stress customers. Take, for example, Inada’s hulking but sinuously elegant $11,999 AI Robo, which uses two pairs of what look like mittened hands to grip, stretch and rub your limbs, with AI-enhanced dexterity. When we tested the chair on a visit to HiTrons, a showroom with locations in New York and New Jersey, the sensation struck us as two parts Canyon Ranch and one part “Uncanny Valley.” The $9,999 leather upholstered, gold-bodied Pharaoh S II from South Korean company Bodyfriend, meanwhile, goes beyond the body, offering 10 “brain massage” options on its touch-screen remote. (No probes are involved, thankfully: Speakers in the headrest deliver a mix of “healing” new-agey music and binaural beats, which are combinations of tonally close frequencies purported to be relaxing.) It also offers 16 automatic massage modes and lets you specify techniques like kneading, tapping, chopping, acupressure and more.<br />A spa-grade chair offers one last benefit, joked Mr. Eisenberg: It brings families together. He asked his college-bound daughter if, when she returns home, it would be “for the chair or for us?” She replied: “Oh, it will be for the chair.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Tucked into a sweeping bipartisan infrastructure bill that passed the Senate earlier this month are measures intended to help provide what many officials say is badly needed regulation of the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry.<br />But some industry and national-security officials warn that the proposal could unintentionally push illicit cryptocurrency transactions into markets where the U.S. government has no reach, adding to the threat to American companies, government agencies and individuals.<br />The provision in the bill requires anyone handling cryptocurrency transactions to report gross proceeds to the Internal Revenue Service, along with the names and addresses of the parties. It is intended to capture billions of dollars in tax revenue the IRS says is lost each year and would also give law enforcement and regulators visibility into a market in which bad actors can too easily operate anonymously.<br />Few dispute the need for disclosure of cryptocurrency transactions as a way to monitor potentially illicit activity. But the bill as written captures corners of the industry not focused on transactions, including everything from miners and stakers to producers of the hardware and software used in crypto markets.<br />Thus some intelligence and law-enforcement officials are joining industry leaders in warning policy makers against overly aggressive regulations that risk exacerbating national-security hazards.</td>

      <td>It’s pretty unlikely Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will announce in his speech Friday that the central bank is officially ready to start pulling back on its asset-buying stimulus effort, economists reckon.<br />Mr. Powell is set to speak on Friday at 10 a.m. ET as part of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s annual Jackson Hole economic symposium. The event was moved last week to an all-online format because of the rising risks around the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Mr. Powell will speak amid broad expectations the Fed will soon be able to pull back on its $120 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage bond purchases, as the job market continues to make a solid pace recovering what it lost during the Covid crisis’s early stages.<br />Recently released meeting minutes from the Fed’s late July policy gathering showed that officials believed then that asset buying could start to slow down—”taper” in market parlance—by the end of this year. That view is roughly in alignment with that of big banks and money funds, which told the Fed ahead of the July Federal Open Market Committee meeting that they saw the taper process starting in January and ending in late 2022.<br />Fed officials have repeatedly said they would signal a slowdown of the purchases as early and as clearly as they can, in a bid to not repeat the 2013 taper tantrum. Then, markets reacted chaotically to the prospect of slowing the asset-buying stimulus.</td>

Also expected are  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon and Brian Moynihan, president and CEO of  Bank of America Corp. , among other representatives of the financial industry.<br />Wednesday’s summit is the first high-profile meeting Mr. Biden will have as president with the private sector to discuss cybersecurity. Senior White House officials have said for months that the problem is one of shared responsibility between government and industries—particularly those responsible for operating the nation’s critical infrastructure—and have recently suggested the administration could look to pursue mandates if voluntary security standards aren’t widely adopted.<br />Mr. Biden in the early months of his administration highlighted cybersecurity as a top national security concern in the wake of a devastating Russian espionage operation, discovered in the final months of the Trump administration, that compromised at least 10 federal agencies and 100 U.S. companies.<br />The issue grew more pronounced as a threat this spring and summer after a spree of high-profile ransomware attacks forced the shutdowns of a major U.S. fuel pipeline, a large meat distributor and a range of small businesses.</td>

U.S. and NATO forces are sending special rescue teams into Taliban-controlled areas of the city to spirit their citizens into the airport. And countless Afghans who thought the U.S. would protect them after having assisted the U.S.-led coalition forces in the past two decades are now realizing that they will most likely be left behind, to face Taliban wrath alone.<br />Private rescue efforts are facing growing obstacles this week, just as the urgency grows. Chartered planes are flying out of Kabul with hundreds of empty seats. New Taliban checkpoints on the road to Pakistan have made driving out of the country increasingly risky. Confusing bureaucratic hurdles have prevented countless people from leaving Afghanistan.<br />“It’s total chaos,” said Warren Binford, a law professor at the University of Colorado who has been working on various evacuation efforts. “What’s happening is that we’re seeing a massive underground railroad operation where, instead of running for decades, it’s literally running for a matter of hours, or days.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Tuesday reinstated a Trump-era policy that requires asylum applicants to wait in Mexico while their claims are evaluated by U.S. authorities. The three liberal justices dissented.<br />President Biden canceled the Trump administration Migrant Protection Protocols, commonly called the Remain in Mexico policy, responding to criticism that it forced vulnerable migrants to wait out their cases in violent border cities. Lower courts found the administration failed to follow proper procedures in ending the policy and that the alternative of paroling into the U.S. asylum applicants en masse may violate federal law.<br />The Biden administration asked the Supreme Court to let it cancel Remain in Mexico while it appealed, but in a brief order Tuesday evening, the justices said the government was unlikely to prevail.<br />The administration “failed to show a likelihood of success on the claim that the memorandum rescinding the Migrant Protection Protocols was not arbitrary and capricious,” the unsigned order said. Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan indicated they would have granted the government’s application.<br />“The Department of Homeland Security respectfully disagrees with the district court’s decision and regrets that the Supreme Court declined to issue a stay,” the department said in a statement, adding that the administration was in discussions with Mexico over an agreement to re-implement the program.</td>

      <td>The Taliban says get out by Aug. 31. The U.S. President agrees.</td>
      <td>Some readers were upset by our editorial last week: “Biden to Afghanistan: Drop Dead.” But that headline looks more sadly accurate than ever after President Biden’s decision Tuesday to stick to his arbitrary Aug. 31 deadline for withdrawing all U.S. troops from Afghanistan.<br />Unless you’re Nancy Pelosi or a media partisan, there’s no sugarcoating what this means. Mr. Biden is bowing to Taliban demands, reiterated on Tuesday, not to extend the deadline. He is rejecting the advice of such G-7 leaders as Britain’s Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron of France to stay longer to get more people out of the country safely. And he is abandoning thousands of Afghans who fought with the U.S. and NATO to the Taliban’s brand of retribution.<br />There was an alternative. Mr. Biden could have sent in enough military force to provide safe zones and retrieve stranded Americans and Afghan allies. He could have done so with a NATO coalition of the willing. The U.S. Army has 31 active duty combat brigades of several thousand soldiers each.<br />He could have told the Taliban that the U.S. is not negotiating over the deadline and that U.S. forces will remain for as long as it takes to complete the mission of rescuing our people. This would have salvaged some honor and credibility from the botched withdrawal.<br />Instead Mr. Biden has negotiated with the Taliban from a position of weakness. He has sent too few troops to protect the Kabul airport and retrieve our allies. He sent his CIA director to negotiate with the Taliban, who adopted Mr. Biden’s Aug. 31 deadline as their own and rejected William Burns’s entreaties.</td>

      <td>House holdouts agree to a fig leaf and pass Bernie Sanders’s budget outline.</td>
      <td>The Kabuki theater production of House Democrats closed off-Broadway on Tuesday after a very limited run. The vaunted showdown between nine or so “centrists” and the party’s progressive wing ended with a whimper as the centrists settled for a token procedural promise.<br />Faux crisis averted. Nancy Pelosi takes another media turn as a legislative wizard—a Tony award nomination may be coming—and the progressive juggernaut moves on to try to pass $4.5 trillion or more in spending and the biggest tax increase since 1968. This was all so predictable.<br />The centrist Democrats had insisted that they wouldn’t vote for the progressives’ $3.5 trillion budget outline until the House first considered the Senate’s $1 trillion infrastructure plan. In the event, they settled for a classic political fig leaf. The House voted 220-212 for a rule that “deems” the $3.5 trillion outline passed—which is supposed to be a political victory because it lets the centrists claim they didn’t directly vote for the resolution.<br />But of course the resolution passed and allows Congress to move ahead with the reconciliation process that requires only 51 votes in the Senate to pass a budget bill. This is what Bernie Sanders needed to move his agenda through the Senate.<br />The centrists are also crowing that Mrs. Pelosi agreed to a House vote on the Senate’s infrastructure bill by Sept. 27—presumably before Democrats have completed the legislative text of all the details of their $3.5 trillion plan. Yet even this may not be much of a promise, since Mrs. Pelosi didn’t secure the support of her left flank. The 100-strong Congressional Progressive Caucus on Tuesday reiterated that its position is “unchanged,” and that it will vote against the infrastructure bill until a final reconciliation package is complete.</td>

      <td>Entertainment elites try to erase their political sycophancy.</td>
      <td>What the liberal establishment giveth, it can also take away. Last November the adulation heaped on New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo reached an embarrassing apex when he received an Emmy award “in recognition of his leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic and his masterful use of television to inform and calm people around the world.”<br />But now that Mr. Cuomo has been run out of office over sexual-harassment allegations, the International Academy that bestows the celebrity prizes wants to pretend its partisan sycophancy never happened. On Tuesday it rescinded the award granted only nine months ago, replacing the announcement page on its website with a notice that Mr. Cuomo’s “name and any reference to his receiving the award will be eliminated from International Academy materials going forward.”<br />Mr. Cuomo’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak never deserved media adulation, much less special cultural recognition. New York’s death rate was among the highest in the U.S., and the economic toll from lockdowns among the most severe. The failure to protect nursing homes in the state was already widely known when the academy gave its award.<br />Yet Mr. Cuomo was elevated in the quest to promote a Donald Trump foil. One speaker at the Emmy virtual ceremony said as much. “In the darkest days of the pandemic, your daily briefings, live from New York, gave us hope, gave us clarity, gave us the truth, and gave us something that we were not getting from Washington: Leadership,” gushed actor Billy Crystal.<br />Some commentary at the award presentation was even more cringeworthy in retrospect. Ben Stiller suggested Mr. Cuomo might get “more dates than votes,” and the Governor joked that the actor was “testing the boundaries of decorum.”</td>

      <td>President Biden’s rental eviction ban has reached the Supreme Court a second time, and the Administration’s defense of its action is an alarm bell for the Justices about executive overreach.<br />In a brief filed Monday, the Administration argues that the law “by its plain terms grants the government broad authority” to take any measures that “in [its] judgment” are “necessary” to prevent contagion. It assumes as a given that the government could confine non-infectious people in their homes.<br />“It would be strange to hold that the government may combat infection by prohibiting the tenant from leaving his home, but not by prohibiting the landlord from throwing him out,” the brief says. Try to find the limiting principle in that view of the powers of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />In defending its restrictions on cruise ships, the government had previously argued it could “shut down transportation in general” and entire industries. “Their legal authority goes all the way to getting transmission to zero,” a CDC attorney said. “Just because that’s not factually an option doesn’t mean that they don’t have the legal authority to try.” Wow.<br />A federal judge in Florida in June enjoined the CDC’s cruise-ship rules, joking (in part) that the government’s expansive interpretation of its public health powers could allow it to “generally shut down sexual intercourse in the United States.” Such an interpretation would run afoul of the non-delegation doctrine, the judge explained.</td>

      <td>On masks and in-person learning, families are again at the mercy of bureaucrats and teachers unions.</td>
      <td>The officials in charge of running the nation’s public schools had all summer—and $122 billion in Covid relief funds from Congress—to plan for the first day of school, so naturally chaos has ensued as students begin heading back to the classroom.<br />San Francisco, Miami and Dallas haven’t decided on a quarantine policy or what infection-rate threshold will trigger school closures. In New York City, home to the nation’s largest school system, principals are wondering how every student can return to in-person learning full-time while still adhering to social-distancing requirements. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a vaccine mandate for all school staff, but teachers unions have vowed to challenge its implementation.<br />School in parts of the South started earlier this month, at least temporarily. Burbio, a website that tracks school openings, has already “identified over 100 school closures across 70 districts” because of Covid. Classes haven’t begun yet in the Northeast and Upper Midwest, so those numbers will almost certainly rise as the Delta variant runs its course, but why are school and health officials keeping parents in prolonged suspense about contingencies? Last year, we were new at this game, and the people in charge arguably deserved some slack. Not anymore.<br />The Rand Corp. has released the results of a nationwide parent survey on school hesitancy taken in July. Although Delta was already spreading by then, 89% of parents, including more than 80% of typically more hesitant black and Hispanic respondents, said they would opt for in-person learning for their children this year. Parents apparently understand the health risks, and they’re weighing them against the harm of another year of horribly substandard instruction via Zoom.<br />What these families need is detailed information on the criteria used to determine whether schools stay open. Instead, they’re being kept in the dark by bureaucrats and politicians. And they’re being toyed with by union honchos who don’t mind the uncertainty because it can be used as leverage to negotiate better pay and benefits as a condition of returning to the classroom.</td>

These gaps, often only 1 percentage point, weren’t statistically significant.<br />Yet the LCPS superintendent deemed them sufficient evidence to bring in other outside groups, which declared that Loudoun County was systemically racist, and that the administration needed to embrace critical race theory’s concept of equity.</td>

I see the option to work remotely a day or two a week as a plus, but its absence wouldn’t be a deal breaker.<br />Face-to-face interaction is important for building employee morale and work culture. When I entered the workforce four years ago, being surrounded by my peers in an office energized me and built a sense of solidarity as we worked together. The opportunity to bump into colleagues from other teams or grab coffee with senior management added variety to the day. I think these encounters are especially important for teaching fresh graduates how to behave in a professional environment and stimulating their ambitions.<br />Working in Shanghai last year, when the city recovered from the pandemic around April, I saw that Chinese companies didn’t give employees any illusions that they would work from home forever. Workplaces shifted very quickly from split-shifts to back-to-office in the span of a few weeks. My co-workers’ initial reluctance quickly dissipated and everyone got back into the groove very quickly. They became thankful for more-productive face-to-face meetings and a dedicated space to work without distractions.</td>

      <td>The story of how an ad hoc naval demolitions team evolved into an elite special-operations force ready for missions over sea, air and land.</td>
      <td>For eight decades, the U.S. has fought two kinds of wars. Fascism, communism and jihadist terrorism have prompted the big ones: World War II, Korea, Vietnam and Iraq were pay-any-price wars in which vast armies fought set-piece battles. Meanwhile, asymmetrical conflicts—whether of the stand-alone variety (think Somalia and Grenada) or as adjuncts to bigger wars (Cambodia or Pakistan)—required a scalpel, not a sledgehammer, wielded by America’s special-operations forces.<br />In popular consciousness, Navy SEALs have emerged as the elite of the elite. From a campy 1990s Charlie Sheen film to blockbusters like 2013’s “Lone Survivor,” SEALs have enjoyed a reputation as America’s most lethal warriors. Entire bookshelves have been dedicated to SEAL heroics, fitness and leadership. Even SEAL dogs have spawned a line of bestsellers (“Trident K9 Warriors” and “No Ordinary Dog,” to name two).<br />Few books, however, have explored why a naval force dubbed SEAL fights terrorists hundreds of miles from the ocean, in dust-caked cities like Mosul or Abbottabad. Benjamin H. Milligan jumps into this breach with “By Water Beneath the Walls: The Rise of the Navy SEALs.”<br />Mr. Milligan, a decorated former SEAL himself, plumbs the origins of the fabled Sea, Air and Land force, from its proto-forms in a variety of military services to its official founding in the early 1960s and its maturity in the river deltas of Vietnam. His story begins during World War II with the Navy’s top brass wrangling over the creation of an island-raiding force for harassing Japanese troops in the Pacific. Marine raiders fought at Tulagi, then at Makin Atoll and Saipan. In North Africa and in China, Navy frogmen working in “underwater demolition teams” (UDTs) reconnoitered invasion beaches in the dark, blasted obstacles blocking invading troops, and trained guerrillas to fight.<br />These teams were often the first to draw enemy fire. Aboard an “ungainly vessel, with nerves cinched tight with tension, was a second-class gunner’s mate from Chicago named Bill Freeman,” Mr. Milligan writes of a demolitions man motoring up to the Moroccan coast in 1942. Freeman’s team had been sent to help secure Port Lyautey and its airfield, an anchor to the Allied supply lines for armies fighting Rommel in the Tunisian desert. “After a moment’s rush, comically zigzagging to ditch the spotlight,” the men found themselves under attack. Suddenly “machine gun bullets ripped into one of the rubber boats stacked atop the engine housing, deflating it with a hiss along with any bravado the men had unconsciously brought.”</td>

Employees who aren’t fully vaccinated by Sept. 7 must work from home, the memo said.<br />The Food and Drug Administration on Monday granted full approval to the Covid-19 vaccine from  Pfizer Inc.  and partner  BioNTech SE .<br />President Joe Biden, in response, urged private-sector employers to make vaccines mandatory. “I call on you to do that—require it,” he said.<br />In July,  Morgan Stanley  began requiring employees and visitors to confirm their vaccination status to enter its offices in New York City and nearby Westchester County.

      <td>Former New York governor says he granted clemency to David Gilbert, convicted in fatal armored-car robbery, and five other people</td>
      <td><br />In his final hours as New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo commuted the sentences of five people, including David Gilbert, who was involved in the 1981 robbery of a Brink’s armored car that left two police officers and a security guard dead.<br />The former governor, who resigned just before midnight Monday, said he granted clemency to six people because of their rehabilitation and involvement in their communities. Four will be released from prison and one will be fully pardoned, Mr. Cuomo said. He said Mr. Gilbert, who was convicted of three counts of second-degree murder and four counts of first-degree robbery nearly four decades ago, will go before a parole board that will consider his release.<br />“These clemencies make clear the power of redemption, encourage those who have made mistakes to engage in meaningful rehabilitation, and show New Yorkers that we can work toward a better future,” Mr. Cuomo said.<br />The other four men whose sentences were commuted were convicted on varying counts of second-degree murder are: Greg Mingo, 68 years old; Robert Ehrenberg, 62; Ulysses Boyd, 66; and Paul Clark, 59. Lawrence Penn, the 51-year-old former Camelot chief executive who had pleaded guilty to grand larceny and falsifying business records in 2015, was pardoned.</td>

      <td>U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reverses a Trump-era rule for the annual artwork competition</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Federal Duck Stamps will no longer be required to show hunting imagery, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said Tuesday as it reversed a Trump administration decree.<br />Fish and Wildlife oversees an annual competition for the stamp’s artwork, and participation in the contest fell 27% in 2020, the year after the hunting mandate took effect, the agency said.<br />The change will give “artists more flexibility when designing their art,” Fish and Wildlife said in a statement.<br />The stamps, which cost $25, must be purchased by waterfowl hunters over the age of 16 but are also widely collected by birders, wildlife photographers and conservationists. Sales support conservation.<br />The requirement for hunting imagery, such as firearms and decoys, grew out of an initiative by former Trump administration Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke to promote hunting.</td>

      <td>Maybe the presidency wasn’t the ideal job for a first-time executive after all.</td>
      <td>More Americans now disapprove of the job Joe Biden is doing as President than approve, according to the RealClearPolitics average of public opinion polls. The significant deterioration in support for Mr. Biden since the start of his presidency—accelerated by his chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan—is likely due in part to unrealistic expectations sold to news consumers by U.S. media outlets and by Mr. Biden himself.<br />A more or less typical inhabitant of Washington’s political swamp, Mr. Biden was commonly presented in 2020 as experienced and principled. Now the media presenters of this idea have suddenly been confronted with its refutation, as Princeton’s Robert George noted last week:<br />Among the many problems overlooked in the media campaign to elect Mr. Biden is that his work experience is remarkably limited for someone his age. In March this column noted:<br />After thinking it over, many voters have decided he’s managing poorly. Susan Page, Matthew Brown and Mabinty Quarshie report on Mr. Biden’s standing in the latest USA Today/Suffolk University poll:<br />The Biden polling weakness is not limited to the issue of Afghanistan, according to USA Today:</td>

      <td>Prosecutors must clarify why agency’s new limits on pursuing journalists shouldn’t apply to far-right talk-show host charged in Jan. 6 attack, judge says</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Attorney General Merrick Garland’s move last month to limit Justice Department probes of journalists is facing an early test from an unlikely source: a federal judge overseeing a criminal case against a talk-show host on Infowars, a right-wing website known for touting discredited conspiracy theories.<br />In an order made public Tuesday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui said prosecutors refused to answer on the record whether they had complied with the department’s updated media policy when seeking a warrant to arrest the talk-show host, Owen Shroyer, for his alleged involvement in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.<br />“The events of January 6th were an attack on the foundation of our democracy,” the judge wrote. “But this does not relieve the Department of Justice from following its own guidelines, written to preserve the very same democracy.”<br />Prosecutors had provided enough evidence to warrant Mr. Shroyer’s being put on criminal trial, Judge Faruqui wrote, but they wouldn’t lay out their reasons for determining that Mr. Shroyer wasn’t a member of the news media.<br />“The Department of Justice appears to believe that it is the sole enforcer of its regulations,” the judge concluded. “That leaves the court to wonder who watches the watchmen.”</td>
