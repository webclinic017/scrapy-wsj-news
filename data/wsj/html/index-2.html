      <td>Amjad Masad came to America in January 2012. He was from Amman, Jordan, and 24. He came because his father, a Palestinian immigrant to Jordan and a government worker, bought him a computer when he was 6. Amjad fell in love and discovered his true language. He studied the history of the computer and became enamored of the U.S. and Silicon Valley. He imagined the latter as a futuristic place with flying cars and floating buildings. He saw the 1999 movie “Pirates of Silicon Valley,” about Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, and decided America was the place he must be.<br />His memory of arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport is a jumble, but what he saw from the bridge going into Manhattan was unforgettable—the New York skyline gleaming in the distance. It was like a spiritual experience. He was here.</td>

A California ballot initiative, set to take effect on Saturday, may send ham and bacon prices up even more.<br />The Prevention of Cruelty to Farm Animals Act, also known as Proposition 12, was backed by the Humane Society and approved by 63% of California voters in 2018. The law establishes minimum space requirements for farm animals and prohibits the sale of meat from animals raised in housing that doesn’t meet its specifications. State regulators will inspect out-of-state farms to ensure they are in compliance. A business owner or operator—including supermarkets, restaurants and meat processors—found to be violating the law could be charged with a misdemeanor punishable with fines up to $1,000 or as many as 180 days in jail, as well as civil penalties. This in a state where shoplifting is rarely prosecuted.</td>

A pair of separate studies—from the Netherlands and South Africa—have found that T cells mobilized by vaccination reduce the severity of the disease.<br />The vaccines generate antibodies against Covid, but those defenses have been found to be less effective over time. T cells, a type of white blood cell, are a second line of defense that have held up better. The Dutch study found that while antibody responses fade against Omicron, the T cell response remains robust.</td>

Everything in the city is worse than Mr. de Blasio found it, which means new Mayor Eric Adams inherits a mess but also has a turnaround opportunity.<br />Mr. Adams has three main challenges, and the portents from his early decisions are good. The first is restoring public order, which as a former police captain the new mayor well understands. He emerged from the crowded Democratic primary on a pledge to reduce the crime wave that has surged as Mr. de Blasio, the City Council, Democrats in Albany and prosecutors demonized police and let criminals out of jail free.</td>

      <td>Mark Zuckerberg donated $400 million to districts that mostly elect Democrats.</td>
      <td>What’s a good way to erode Americans’ trust in elections further? The answer can be found in North Carolina, where Gov. Roy Cooper recently vetoed a bill that would ban private funding for public election administration. Such funding was rampant in 2020—in North Carolina and nationwide—and it likely benefited Democrats. Some states have already enacted a ban, and more should follow before the 2022 midterms.<br />Gov. Cooper vetoed a bill passed by the Republican legislature. Lawmakers were responding to 2020’s unprecedented phenomenon of individuals and organizations, usually from out of state, providing grants directly to state and local election officials. The money came from a variety of sources, but the largest by far was $400 million from Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, and his wife, Priscilla Chan. Primarily routed through the Center for Tech and Civic Life, the funding was dispersed to roughly 2,500 counties in 47 states and the District of Columbia. The center described it as a means of ensuring “safe and reliable” voting amid the pandemic, and while jurisdictions had to request the money, there was no mechanism for oversight or accountability once they had the funds in hand.</td>

Had the Champagne label’s founder still been alive, he would have been thrilled to see that his brand had made it to Antarctica.<br />In “Champagne Charlie,” Don and Petie Kladstrup present a fascinating portrait of an audacious French wine merchant during his travels around mid-19th-century America. In 1852 Charles-Camille Heidsieck decided to expand his business into the U.S. He ignored warnings that the country was dangerous. Americans were unsophisticated, he was told; they drank whiskey or beer. Outside the upper classes, wine and Champagne were practically unknown.</td>

As the eight-part series commences in London, an article in the Daily Telegraph is expressing the theory that such a journey is possible. At the luxe Reform Club of London, where the musty all-male membership dines on gelatinous brown soup and boiled beef, the report is dismissed by most members as twaddle. Piffle. Bosh.</td>

      <td>An aging jockey deals with a lifetime of physical wear and tear while showing a newcomer to horse racing his way around the track.</td>
      <td>Doctors ask patients to describe their pain on a one-to-10 scale. I’d put the experience of watching Clint Bentley’s “Jockey” close to the top, even if it’s only sympathetic pain felt for the hero, Jackson Silva (Clifton Collins Jr.), a once-great rider with a battered body that can’t take any more punishment after decades of routine insults, terrifying falls and grievous injuries. Yet the film also rates high on the pleasure scale for being a debut feature by abundantly gifted filmmakers and a showcase for a performance that fills your heart while frequently threatening to break it. Turns out you really can have it both ways—a harsh story with the ring of truth and a reasonably hopeful ending. (The film, written by Mr. Bentley and Greg Kwedar, is playing in theaters in New York and Los Angeles prior to expanding its distribution.)<br />The source of Jackson’s physical pain is no mystery. Jockeys, like fashion models, must obsess about their weight and therefore their diet, so their bones become brittle. Jackson has broken his back several times in falls. His right hand shakes, his arm is weak and his posture in the saddle has become cockeyed, yet his idea of taking care of himself is consulting a horse doctor. (As a chronicle of dangerous jobs and chronic pain, “Jockey,” set in and around a Phoenix racetrack called Turf Paradise, is a companion piece to Chloé Zhao’s “The Rider,” which played out in the world of regional rodeos.)</td>

Fertilizer comes from fossil-fuel sources and needs fossil fuels to be delivered to farmers.<br />The intensive use of Roundup also affects water, soil and air.

They include Germany (1917), Turkey (1856), Japan (1905) and newly created Poland (1918-21).<br />The armies of Napoleon and Hitler ravaged Russia. About 1 in 7 Soviets died in World War II, which began for Stalin when he invaded Poland. Even tiny Finland humiliated the Soviets early in the Winter War (1939-40). Later, Russia became bogged down for years in guerrilla wars in Chechnya and Afghanistan. It is memory of military misfortune that makes an invasion of Ukraine unpalatable to the Russian people.</td>

      <td>Competitors can sell sodas for less than convenience retailers can buy them wholesale.</td>
      <td>Noah Phillips and Joshua Wright correctly note that “antitrust laws protect competition” and “competition benefits society—and consumers” (“As Inflation Rises, Antitrust ‘Reformers’ Target Lower Prices,” op-ed, Dec. 21) But dumping the Robinson-Patman Act is the wrong conclusion. Price discrimination based on arbitrary retail “channels” raises prices and hurts competition. Even when they are larger and more efficient, convenience retailers pay higher prices than competitors on a range of products, particularly sodas.<br />Convenience retailers regularly find that competitors can sell sodas for less than they can buy them wholesale. This happens regardless of purchase volume. Suppliers also refuse to sell some products to the convenience channel. These limitations make products less fungible and add to supply-chain problems.</td>

Others are free to return to work five days earlier. The state Health Department described its guidance as allowing for a shortened quarantine for “Healthcare Workers and Other Critical Workforce.” But the meaning is the same: People will be confined to their homes not based solely on their risk of contagion but also on the government’s perception of their social or economic value.<br />Throughout the pandemic, politicians have exhorted the public to “follow the science.” Courts have generally deferred to public-health decrees that greatly restrict individual liberty—on the assumption that they are grounded in epidemiological considerations. Such factors include the disease’s incubation period, its severity and the immunity of the exposed person. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week said that quarantine beyond five days is unnecessary for any vaccinated person.</td>

But then something unexpected happened in my freshman year: I took an honest look at my game, meticulously compared my stats with those of my peers, and realized I would never be good enough to make a living as a pro. I wondered whether I should quit on my dream.<br />I played for the rest of college, even becoming a two-time Academic All-American athlete, but I gave up on the idea of ever playing professionally. This was an agonizing decision that went against my upbringing. But I’m lucky I quit, because I found another calling, one that I did turn out to have an above-the-curve talent for: economics. Decades later, my work as an economist has convinced me that good old Vince got it wrong. People don’t quit enough.</td>

The slow drip out of Treasury—and ultimately taxpayer pockets—is more palatable than wiping $1 trillion off the books in one fell swoop with legislation that forgives as much as $50,000 in debt per student.<br />Recurring suspensions of student loan payments are, in concept, similar to the entitlement-program phaseout chicanery baked into Democrats’ stalled Build Back Better bill. The agenda is to make the programs permanent by whetting the appetites of new benefit recipients. They would then demand permanence and vote for Democrats to make it happen.</td>

Those cities that early on implemented multiple nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including school, church and theater closings, as well as bans on public gatherings, had peak death rates approximately 50% lower than those that did not.<br />Few cities maintained NPIs longer than six weeks in 1918, so their effect on cumulative excess mortality was smaller. In the researchers’ summary, “These findings support the hypothesis that rapid implementation of multiple NPIs can significantly reduce influenza transmission, but that viral spread will be renewed upon relaxation of such measures.” I think readers should know that the evidence is not one-sided.</td>

The suitcase was packed with luxuries unimaginable to everyday Poles: fine German coffee, Swiss chocolates, Hermès scarves and French perfumes. Everything was individually wrapped so that the recipient could open it in privacy, avoiding embarrassment. Of course, they had presents for us as well: things like art books and locally made porcelain and crystal.</td>

Plastering over the ever-growing list of human-rights abuses—including the takeover of Hong Kong, the internment of Muslims in Xinjiang, the disappearance of tennis star Peng Shuai, the Covid coverup and threats to democratic Taiwan—the party wields denial, obfuscation and cash. The latest campaign pushes the absurd claim that China enjoys democratic government at home while deriding as undemocratic the world’s real democracies.<br />The Communist Party shows no inhibition about spreading falsehoods in this new misinformation effort. Published last September, a government white paper broadly publicized in China claimed that the Chinese people “experience a broad, thorough and true democracy.” In October, Xi Jinping said China’s National People’s Congress “guarantees that the people are masters.” In other instances, Mr. Xi has claimed, that “when the people call out, I listen,” and dismissed American democracy, saying people “go into hibernation” after elections and otherwise have “no way to exercise their rights to speak.”</td>

      <td>An airy Catskills getaway is all comfort, with nary a camp cliché in sight</td>
      <td>“RUSTIC YET refined.” This was the aesthetic goal of New York City firms NevelHaus Development and INC Architecture & Design when they began designing and building their contemporary Catskills cabins. The homes would be woodsy country houses for sophisticated design consumers escaping the city, said Adam Rolston, creative director and managing partner at INC. The first of the 19 sustainable residences in New York’s Sullivan and Ulster counties went to Broadway musical “Hamilton” star Phillipa Soo and her actor husband Steven Pasquale.<br />“We flipped for how grand it feels despite its modest footprint,” Mr. Pasquale said of the three-bedroom home, which weighs in at under 2,000 square feet. The 30-foot ceiling in the open plan of the public rooms contributes to its character as a small house with a big personality. The project is, in fact, a study in embracing dichotomies. The shape of the structure is inspired by the traditional black barns that dot the rural Pennsylvania landscape. But instead of the rough-hewn walls and naked beams of standard barn conversions, “the big, open, two-story space has an all-loft feeling, which brought a modern flavor,” said Mr. Rolston. The next polarity to be negotiated: balancing forward-thinking design with the coziness that one expects in a forest getaway. The solution came in marrying contemporary forms with organic, touchable materials—for example, a streamlined living-room sofa upholstered in a rough weave and pine floors that retain their humble character with visible knots.</td>

      <td>Looming behind a record-breaking run for IPOs in 2021 is a darker truth: After a selloff in high-growth stocks during the waning days of the year, two-thirds of the companies that went public in the U.S. this year are now trading below their IPO prices.<br />Traditional initial public offerings raised more money than ever before in 2021, as startup founders and early investors tried to cash in on sky-high valuations. In the first eight months of the year, IPO shares rose. In November, 2021’s class of IPOs were trading up 12% on average, according to Dealogic. By late December, they traded 9% below their IPO prices.</td>

The offense is punishable by up to two years in prison and a fine of 5,000 Hong Kong dollars, equivalent to $641.</td>

      <td>China’s SenseTime has overcome headwinds to go public. Its next challenge is to find a path to profit.<br />The Chinese artificial intelligence company said Wednesday that it raised around $700 million from its initial public offering, at the low end of the price range. The company was forced to delay its IPO earlier this month after the U.S. government added SenseTime to an investment blacklist, alleging that the company’s facial-recognition technology was used in the oppression of mainly Muslim ethnic minorities in China’s Xinjiang region. SenseTime said its lawyers advised that the sanctions applied only to an unlisted subsidiary, but it anyway excluded U.S. investors from its IPO after its restart this week. Support from cornerstone investors, including state-backed ones, have helped carry it through the storm.</td>
