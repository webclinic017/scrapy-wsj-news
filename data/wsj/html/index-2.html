The requirements, detailed Thursday and set to take effect Jan. 4, will cover more than 80 million workers.</td>

Unless you’re  Peloton ,  that is.<br />The connected fitness pioneer used its disappointing quarterly report late Thursday to slash its forecast for the full fiscal year ending next June. Peloton now sees full-year revenue coming in between $4.4 billion and $4.8 billion—$1 billion less at the low end than what the company projected just three months ago. The new projection suggests Peloton sees uncertain demand extending beyond the crucial holiday selling season; its December quarter forecast was only about $340 million shy of Wall Street’s forecasts. Peloton shares promptly slid 28% following the report.</td>

Separately, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a vaccine mandate for health-care facilities with no testing option.</td>

The Treasury even rolled out an estimate claiming it will reduce the federal deficit. Anyone who believes this probably responds to email pitches from Nigeria.<br />For a dose of reality, the better source is the Penn Wharton Budget Model, which on Thursday rolled out its own score of the latest version of the White House ‘framework” deal that House Democrats are moving to pass this week or next. No economic-fiscal model is perfect, but Penn Wharton tries to take into account the impact of tax and spending changes on the economy as well as the federal budget.</td>

      <td>From political cartoons to the Sunday funnies, from D.C. and Marvel to Zap and ‘Maus,’ the evolution of an all-American art form.</td>
      <td>In 1976 Marvel Comics published “Howard the Duck,” starring a foul-mouthed, beak-billed alien stranded on earth among “talking hairless apes.” Sadly, Steve Gerber’s metafictional, existentialist romp was largely dismissed as a “funny animal” comic by those who associated comics with subliterate escapism. The medium itself has long been the ugly duckling of American culture, a stealth art form whose secret, swanlike identity (more bird than plane) has been accorded widespread acclaim only in the past few decades. Comic strips, which emerged at the turn of the 20th century, were at least in respectable newspapers. This could not be said for their down-market cousin, the floppy comic “book” that began littering playgrounds and treehouses in the 1930s.<br />That kiddie stigma proved hard to vanquish, even as adults increasingly embraced comics, and as comics themselves gradually became more adult in content, experimental in form and grandiloquent in name (“graphic novel”; “sequential art”). Within the past generation, though, remarkable works like “Maus,” “Fun Home” and “March” have garnered major awards and public esteem. Even the superhero films monopolizing the multiplexes hope to match decibel levels with savoir faire by recruiting indie directors like Chloé Zhao (“Eternals”). But while they share in their sources’ visual spectacle, these movies can’t capture comics’ unique appeal: their blending of words and pictures in sequence on a page, making the reader an active interpreter of the pregnant silences between panels.</td>

China’s People’s Liberation Army is constantly expanding its ability to project force in the Indo-Pacific region, and its activities in the East and South China seas have unsettled many. China has harassed Taiwan through “gray zone” activities around the Taiwan Strait.<br />I am a defender of the Republic of China—also known as Taiwan—and a seasoned soldier in the resistance against PLA military threats. I was a director of division command staff during the 1996 Taiwan Strait missile crisis. But the current situation is the most challenging since I joined the army four decades ago. China has never given up its ambition to annex Taiwan. Preparing to counter all possible military actions by China has become a daily practice of the Republic of China Armed Forces. I can say proudly that our armed forces have never failed to protect the country. We serve our country with the highest loyalty, defending freedom and democracy so that the people of Taiwan can maintain their way of life and political system.</td>

Who is?<br />The two Southern California ports handle only about 40% of containers entering the U.S., mostly from Asia. Yet ports in other states seem to be handling the surge better. Gov. Ron DeSantis said last month that Florida’s seaports had open capacity. So what’s the matter with California? State labor and environmental policies.</td>

The goal is to mark off a stretch of ocean twice the size of Arizona as off-limits to industrial fishing.</td>

      <td>Kristen Stewart stars as Diana, Princess of Wales, in Pablo Larraín’s gloomy biopic</td>
      <td>The distributors missed a Halloween opening by a week, but if you’re still in the market for gothic horror “Spencer” may do the trick. It won’t do, though, if you’re looking for fresh insights into Diana, Princess of Wales, or even an absorbing rehash of one of the most rehashed stories ever. That’s not to minimize the achievement of Kristen Stewart, who portrays the former Diana Spencer as a woman possessed by outer demons as well as inner ones. The problem is the dramatic vacuum, or suffocating bell jar, in which her performance plays out. Pablo Larraín’s film, written by Steven Knight, calls itself a “fable from a true tragedy.” It might also be called a fever dream, a surreal nightmare, a reductio ad tedium or just an inherently limiting concept that slowly but inexorably squeezes the life out of itself.<br />The production is conceived as a fictional version of an actual event—Diana’s attendance, in 1991, during Christmas festivities over the course of a three-day weekend at Queen Elizabeth’s Sandringham estate. Stylistically, though, the event is seen—and felt—almost entirely from the heroine’s point of view, which, in the Larraín-Knight retelling, is purely that of a victim, and a pouty one at that. This Diana displays few signs of spontaneous life. She feels scorned, trapped, betrayed—her marriage is a shell, as the public will soon learn—constantly spied on and, of course, beset by bulimia, which is the toxic icing on the film’s cake of coal.</td>

      <td>Millennia-old Eternals try to save Earth and its mortal inhabitants from the evil Deviants in Chloé Zhao’s star-studded Marvel movie.</td>
      <td>‘Eternals” answers a question of cosmic proportions, as befits a Marvel release with a whole new cast of supercharacters. The question is how well Chloé Zhao, a singularly gifted filmmaker (“Nomadland”) accustomed to working on a modest scale, was able to do as the director and co-writer of a superexpensive, supercomplicated and superlong action adventure.<br />The answer is more than well enough, even though the story, stretched out over 157 minutes, is rambling and repetitive. (There’s also the question of whether the Eternals, a race of immortal beings who arrived on Earth over 7,000 years ago, can save humanity from the predations of the Deviants, their monstrously evil counterparts, but first things first.) The production’s graphics are striking, with shimmering gold filigrees as a motif. The physical locations are spectacular, a surprise because most examples of the genre are shot in the augmented reality of high-tech soundstages. The spirit of Ms. Zhao’s film—and it is Ms. Zhao’s film—ranges from buoyant to playful during the downtime between generic battles to the almost death. Some of the Eternals we get to meet have grown fond of the human race, despite its endless foibles, and they express their affection with a warmth that’s rare in comic-book epics. What is there to say? Speaking as an earthling, one likes to be liked.</td>

      <td>If Dexter Morgan were in a 12-step program he’d be calling himself a “recovering” serial killer, at least when we first see him in “Dexter: New Blood.” It’s been 10 years (in TV time) since the forensics specialist and homicidal maniac played by Michael C. Hall stopped killing other homicidal maniacs. His life is good in upstate Iron Lake, N.Y. He lives in a cabin in the woods, raises goats, chops firewood, ice fishes and wears overalls. Under an alias, Jimmy Lindsay, he even has some pursuits that test his “sobriety” on a regular basis: Selling guns in the local sports shop. Putting up with obnoxious customers. And sharpening knives and cleavers for the local butcher. “You’re a life saver, Jimmy,” says Gig (David J. Curtis) with gratitude, and no end of unintentional irony.<br />The original “Dexter,” based on novels by Jeff Lindsay and one of television’s more divisive and justifiably controversial dramatic series, ran in new episodes on Showtime from 2006 to 2013 and in reruns on CBS during the 2007-08 Writers Guild strike. Appealing to the viewer’s inner vigilante—as well as to the darker side of his or her sense of humor—it appalled some by making a mass murderer sympathetic. It was also blamed for inspiring several real-life slayings—though if someone is going to be driven to kill by a television program, there’s probably something else going on.</td>

The city that greeted me and my older brother was the menacing New York of the 1980s, and like many other Dominican immigrants, we arrived poor, disoriented and with little notion of what would happen next.<br />I also traveled a great distance from learning English as a second language in the overcrowded classrooms of Intermediate School 61 in Corona, Queens, to enrolling as a freshman at Columbia University in 1991. Besides a fervent immersion in biblical exegesis, and what I had picked up as a child from my father’s self-education in Marxism, I was probably as ignorant of the world of letters as any student in Columbia’s nearly 250-year history.</td>

The Real Clear Politics polling average on Election Day gave the incumbent a nearly eight-point advantage. Like Virginia, this race swung late and hard.</td>

      <td>He focused on what he’d do for voters and kept a respectful distance from Trump.</td>
      <td>Yes, Republican Glenn Youngkin’s victory in the Virginia governor’s race Tuesday was made possible in part by President Biden’s lousy poll numbers. Mr. Biden is at 43% approval, 51% disapproval in the RealClearPolitics average—the worst standing of any modern president at this point except Donald Trump.<br />Still, in a state Mr. Biden carried by 10 points, Gov.-elect Youngkin needed more than bad national presidential numbers. He mounted a superb campaign that Republicans running in purple or light-blue areas next year should study closely.</td>

      <td>The weekend elections defied predictions—and gave Prime Minister Kishida room to step up defense spending, regional exercises and more.</td>
      <td>Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party came away from Halloween with an unexpected treat. All 465 seats of the House of Representatives were up for grabs in Sunday’s elections, and predictions for the LDP were frightening. But the party lost only a handful of seats. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is now in a strong position to pursue tougher policies against threats from China and North Korea.<br />Even Mr. Kishida had been lowering expectations to suggest the ruling coalition may retain only a simple majority. Other experts predicted the loss of the majority and the end of Mr. Kishida’s tenure as prime minister. There was good reason for the pessimism. The usually splintered opposition parties worked together to a greater degree than in previous elections. The main opposition, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, was expected to gain seats; instead, it lost 13.</td>
