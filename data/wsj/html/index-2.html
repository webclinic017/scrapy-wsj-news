      <td>Rules were bent, GOP voters defected, and real fraud hasn’t turned up.</td>
      <td>At his first big political rally of 2022, President Trump was again focused on 2020. “We had a rigged election, and the proof is all over the place,” he said. Mr. Trump was apparently too busy over Christmas to read a 136-page report by a conservative group in Wisconsin, whose review shows “no evidence of widespread voter fraud.”<br />If curious Republicans want to know what really happened in 2020, this is the best summation to date. Released Dec. 7, it was written by the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty (WILL), a policy shop with conservative bona fides that supported many of Mr. Trump’s policies. A Wisconsin judge this month said ballot dropboxes are illegal under state law, in a challenge brought by WILL.</td>

But they’re right to do so. Mr. Johnson’s career is in danger in large part because he has attempted a foolish and failing agenda of big government conservatism.<br />Police said Tuesday they’re investigating parties that were allegedly held in Mr. Johnson’s office-and-residence complex in London’s Downing Street in contravention of lockdown rules in 2020. If evidence emerges that he misled lawmakers about these parties, he may be forced to resign, or subjected to a no-confidence vote by lawmakers from his Conservative party.</td>

      <td>An answer to President Biden’s question from the conservative philosopher Roger Scruton.</td>
      <td>In President Biden’s diffuse, platitudinous and often flat-out erroneous press conference of last week, one question stood out as potent and still awaits an answer. Mr. Biden asked—was it three or four times?—what his opponents, the Republicans, were for, apart from denying him credit for any accomplishments he might have had during his first year in office.<br />We all know what the Republicans are against, which includes the crime currently rampant on our big cities’ streets, the want of anything resembling order on our southern border, the melange of progressive giveaway programs and more. But what is the party, what in general, are American conservatives actually for? The standard answer would include free enterprise, freedom from interference from big government, equality of opportunity if not necessarily of results, the wisdom of the Founding Fathers as embodied in our Constitution, and now, more recently, open schools, an unlocked-down economy, fairness in reporting in the media on politics generally.</td>

      <td>A California state court goes too far in a ruling against Scientology’s arbitration agreement.</td>
      <td>The California Court of Appeal has opened a new front in the legal war over religious exemptions. In Bixler v. Church of Scientology, the court ruled in favor of former members of the church who allege that they were raped by a church agent before leaving the faith. It held that they aren’t bound by an arbitration contract, a condition of church membership, in which they agreed that any claims against the church have to be submitted to Scientology arbitration tribunals.<br />“Scientology’s written arbitration agreements are not enforceable against members who have left the faith, with respect to claims for subsequent non-religious, tortious acts,” the judges wrote. “To hold otherwise would bind members irrevocably to a faith they have the constitutional right to leave.”</td>

      <td>Peter Arcidiacono, an economist at Duke University, and two of his colleagues, Ken Spenner and Esteban Aucejo, published an academic paper in 2012 on how racial preferences affect the number of black science and economics majors at elite universities. It’s the type of research the Supreme Court might keep in mind now that it has agreed to hear cases challenging the use of race-conscious admissions policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina.<br />Mr. Arcidiacono and his co-authors found that among incoming freshmen at Duke who reported a major, more than 76% of black males intended to major in economics or the hard sciences, a higher percentage than among white males. Yet only 35% of black male students went on to obtain a degree in one of these majors, a drop of 41 percentage points. In contrast, the difference between initial and finishing proportions among white males was only 5 percentage points.</td>

The top 1% controlled a third of the city’s wealth. In 1856 Walt Whitman observed that, except for the poorest, New Yorkers were addicted to “occupying houses outrageously and absurdly too expensive.” The great American poet—along with Washington Irving, James Fenimore Cooper, Herman Melville and Edgar Allan Poe—was then helping to make New York the literary capital of the country.</td>

While it suggests any number of similarly plotted thrillers, including “The Girl on the Train,” “Gone Girl,” “Rear Window” and “The House at the End of the Street,” the eight-part Netflix series isn’t just a genre parody. It spoofs a specific film—namely “The Woman in the Window,” last year’s feature starring Amy Adams that made such a lukewarm splash on Netflix. Whether Ms. Adams has discussed this new project with its star, Kristen Bell, is unknown. But it’s an intriguing thing to ponder.<br />So is the fact that Netflix is mocking its own product, while offering reviewers the opportunity to provide spoilers on two shows at the same time.</td>

      <td>Thomas Hamilton’s documentary about the actor best known as Frankenstein’s monster reveals a warm man who meant much to the many lives he touched.</td>
      <td>If there were an actor’s Mount Rushmore of American horror cinema, it would include Lon Chaney, Bela Lugosi, maybe Vincent Price, and without a doubt the subject of “Boris Karloff: The Man Behind the Monster.” In Thomas Hamilton’s not-quite-adoring but hugely affectionate biographical documentary, Karloff emerges as a very decent man, whose job was to terrify millions. And whose often-startling filmography is worth a revisit.<br />It’s no coincidence then that the horror service Shudder is using “Boris Karloff” to kick off a February-long showcase of Karloff films—not just the 1931 “Frankenstein,” in which the actor forever defined Mary Shelley’s Monster in the public imagination, but the magnificently eccentric “Bride of Frankenstein.” Other new additions to Shudder’s Karloff Collection are “Son of Frankenstein,” “House of Frankenstein,” “The Mummy” and the scandalously perverse “The Black Cat.” (They join Mario Bava’s “Black Sabbath” from the early ’60s and James Whale’s “The Old Dark House,” an underappreciated gem in the celebrated catalog of ’30s Universal horror.)</td>

Prior to the singer-songwriter’s “Let’s Stay Together” album—released 50 years ago, on Jan. 31, 1972—male romantic soul tended to be the domain of vocal-harmony groups like the Temptations, the Intruders, the Four Tops and the Delfonics, pop-gospel crooners such as Sam Cooke, Smokey Robinson and Marvin Gaye, and emotive shouters like Percy Sledge, Wilson Pickett and Otis Redding.<br />After the chart success of “Let’s Stay Together,” Mr. Green’s hushed, cooing vocal approach set new boundaries for soul seduction and altered the genre’s landscape. The album peaked at No. 8 on the Billboard pop chart and remained at No. 1 on the R&B chart for 10 weeks, reaching gold status (500,000 copies sold) by the end of April 1972.</td>

As he says, the threat of severe sanctions, even if they can be agreed on among allies, will not be enough. With the Afghan debacle in the background, the inadequate response to the threat to Ukraine will be a dress rehearsal for China and Taiwan. No one should think that China will fail to learn its lessons. The administration’s failure to craft, fund and implement a strong defense policy that might win Vladimir Putin’s respect has put the U.S. on the path to acquiescing in major changes in balances of power that will be unfavorable to us and our allies and to the fate of democracy in the world.<br />Donald L.

The good news is that while protecting the vulnerable remains vital, slowing the spread of the virus needn’t be the priority. The biggest danger from Omicron is probably acute hospital staffing shortages, in part because of asymptomatic employees who stay home from work after testing positive.<br />Although Covid testing can be useful, it also has important limitations. The “gold standard” PCR tests are frequently too sensitive; research has shown that in many cases people who test positive are no longer contagious. The increasingly used rapid antigen tests have the opposite problem, often failing to detect infections during the earlier part of the five-day isolation period of presumed contagiousness.</td>

To put this in perspective, Puerto Rico resolved three times as much debt as Detroit did in its bankruptcy and more than 10 times Detroit’s unfunded pension liability. “It is the court’s hope and expectation,” Judge Laura Taylor Swain said after approving the restructuring, “that the confirmation of the plan marks the beginning of Puerto Rico’s brightest chapter.”<br />The most innovative features of the plan of adjustment seek to ensure that repayment never becomes unaffordable. The recoveries of many creditors are based in part on a contingent-value instrument linked to sales-tax revenue. Only if the revenue is higher than projected—and thus, Puerto Rico’s economy is doing well—will creditors receive a higher recovery.</td>

These days, in the U.S., such characteristics are more often found among middle- and upper-class children than among less-well-off students. What if there were one particular element in a child’s experience that could foster such characteristics in everyone, regardless of socioeconomic status?<br />In “God, Grades, and Graduation,” Ilana Horwitz suggests that religion can play such a role. Of course, nothing is simple, and Ms. Horwitz’s analysis is anything but reductive or unnuanced. But she finds a rich store of data to support such a claim in the National Study of Youth and Religion, a large-scale longitudinal survey run by the University of Notre Dame. Young people who are “abiders”—that is, who are active in religious communities and who have adopted their family’s faith as their own—“are likely to have an academic advantage because religion and schools are complementary institutions.” In particular, “adolescents who thrive in one institution are likely to thrive in the other.”</td>
