      <td>In diplomacy and governing, there are few permanent victories, mostly hard-fought opportunities to make continued progress with continued attention. I often think of Benjamin Franklin’s comment to a young citizen after the delegates finished drafting the Constitution in Philadelphia, promising that they had created “a republic, if you can keep it.” After COP26, something similar could be said for climate diplomacy: It was an important breakthrough, if we can follow through on it.<br />A gap remains between the ambition the world demonstrated at the climate conference in Glasgow and the actions we need to take to avoid chaos by limiting the Earth’s temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The outcome of COP26 kept the ability to avoid that disaster within reach. At the climate conference, the world finally brought together the coalition we need to win this fight, not only almost 200 governments but the private sector, large organizations, tribal and indigenous communities, and young people. With continued cooperation across this alliance, we are entering the decisive decade of our climate battle prepared for the fight.</td>

      <td>Gasoline prices are the highest they have been in seven years and inflation is at a 30-year high, a double hit to American families. The Biden administration has aggravated the situation with new regulatory requirements on oil and gas producers as well as limits on domestic oil and gas exploration. But policy inaction also costs Americans at the pump. Consider the Biden administration’s failure to make decisions on the Renewable Fuels Standard.<br />Under the RFS, the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Department of Energy, sets the annual volumes of renewable fuel, such as ethanol and biodiesel, to be blended into the nation’s fuel supply. Congress set the general RFS parameters into law in 2007, but the specific annual volume targets must be set by regulation for each coming year before that year begins.</td>

      <td>Would ‘public opinion’ improve if Americans had more instruction from professors, journalists and fact-checkers?</td>
      <td>‘We the People,” the first three words of the Constitution, were a bit of legerdemain on the part of draftsman Gouverneur Morris, but they have rightly resonated over the years, not least when the definition of “the people” was expanded by universal white manhood suffrage in the 1830s and by the enfranchisement of blacks in 1870. It’s not surprising that aristocratic European observers like Alexis de Tocqueville and Lord Bryce were struck by the importance of public opinion when they visited the U.S. in the 1830s and 1880s, both decades of bitter partisan competition. For Susan Herbst, however, the key decade for enthroning the sentiments of “we the people” came much later—in the 1930s. It was then, she argues in “A Troubled Birth,” that we got stuck with the parched and crabbed notion of public opinion with which we’re still stuck today.<br />Ms. Herbst, a political-science professor at the University of Connecticut (and its former president), makes her case not in a single narrative but in a series of essays that circle around the subject. It’s an appealing approach, unevenly executed. Her most arresting writing comes in a lyric description of the 1939-40 New York World’s Fair, with its corporate pavilions (especially General Motors’ Futurama) and contributions from around the world (though Nazi Germany was absent and the Soviet pavilion was closed after the August 1939 Hitler-Stalin pact). The World’s Fair was a high-impact event, with attendance of 45 million, but in Ms. Herbst’s view it was “infantilizing,” helping to create a public that was “passive, easily entertained,” and “characterized by cheerful consumption.”</td>

Speaker Nancy Pelosi marched her majority off a cliff in 2010 with votes on ObamaCare, and now she has done it again.<br />The Speaker muscled the bill through on a 220-213 vote. No Republicans voted aye, and Rep. Jared Golden of Maine was the sole Democratic dissenter. Other swing-district Democrats had made a show of demanding concessions and a bill that “paid for itself,” but in the end the bill didn’t pay for itself even by the rigged rules of the Congressional Budget Office. But they still rolled over, as they always do when Mrs. Pelosi gives the order.</td>

But the music industry’s sudden solidarity with repressed Cuban artists is progress.<br />The title of “Patria y Vida” is a rejection of the Cuban revolutionary slogan “Homeland or Death.” Written and recorded by musicians on the island and in the U.S., the song rebukes an illegitimate dictatorship that has lasted for 62 years. “Who told you that Cuba is yours,” the song dares to ask. “If my Cuba belongs to all my people your time is up, the silence is broken.”</td>

If it’s OK for travelers under 12 and over 75 to keep their shoes on through airport security, then surely it’s OK for everyone. Americans aren’t stupid. Each time we’re spun or deceived or outright lied to, trust in government melts away.<br />Case in point: President Biden’s speech at the Port of Baltimore about the recently enacted bipartisan infrastructure plan, in which he said “this bill is going to reduce the cost of goods to consumers.” Spend more, prices go down? Not likely. A few breaths later: “I’m going to create good-paying union jobs—union . . . not $12 an hour, not $15 an hour—$45 an hour and up with good benefits.” And that will somehow reduce the cost of goods to consumers?

Of the survivors, two civilians were injured—one moderately and one who is still in serious condition—and two police officers were lightly wounded, Israeli police said. The dead civilian was identified by Israeli police as 26-year-old Eliyahu David Kay, a recent immigrant from South Africa who worked in the Old City of Jerusalem.</td>

For the most part, our suffering is invisible and irrelevant to those outside our circle of family and friends.

On Oct. 21, the actor and producer Alec Baldwin accidentally shot and killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins while filming a movie in New Mexico. He tweeted, “There are no words to convey my shock and sadness.” That highly publicized tragedy unfolded, of course, against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, during which families and friends have had to face the possibility of infecting each other accidentally, with potentially fatal results. The realization that good intentions are no assurance of benign outcomes is painful and frightening.</td>

The auto makers mutually decided to focus on their own projects, scrapping plans to jointly develop a new model as had been envisioned under a partnership struck in early 2019, representatives from each company said.</td>

      <td>The endlessly recombining narratives of Marvel comics have their roots in cheap entertainment, but they offer a multiverse of stories.</td>
      <td>From the early 1960s to today, the world of Marvel superheroes has seen its fan base grow from an inner circle of comic-book addicts to, well, seemingly everybody. Beginning with the first issue of The Fantastic Four, in 1961, readers have followed the serialized adventures of characters who possess both extra-human abilities and the quintessentially human quality of vulnerability. The bitter, rock-skinned, immensely strong Thing of the Fantastic Four; the green-skinned, enraged, even more immensely strong Hulk; and, especially, the perpetually tormented Spider-Man—these are among the often confused, not-always-heroic heroes whose adventures drew an increasingly sophisticated readership during a decade that brought real-world confusion of its own. Some have observed that with the expansion of Marvel’s universe over the decades, particularly through the many recent top-grossing movies based on the comic books, Marvel has moved from the counterculture deep into the culture itself, becoming a colossal, ongoing, near-mythological epic made up of many, many characters whose narrative arcs frequently intertwine in fascinating, sometimes bewildering ways. Latecomers, especially moviegoers who want to read the comics for a deeper understanding of the “cinematic universe” they have come to love, may ask: Where do I start?<br />Enter Douglas Wolk, whose previous books include “Reading Comics: How Graphic Novels Work and What They Mean” (2007). For his new book, “All of the Marvels,” he “went all out so you don’t have to”—that is, he spent a couple of years reading more than 27,000 Marvel comic books, with the aim of mapping out key points along the trajectories of Marvel’s best-known titles (and even a couple of the lesser-known ones) as a guide for new readers. Mr. Wolk is quick to point out that his book is not a syllabus—one of the many charms of this highly enjoyable volume is its spirit of inclusivity: He is against the idea of Marvel as the special province of some grizzled, in-the-know crowd who have followed Marvel stories for most of their lives (a crowd that includes Mr. Wolk himself, who worked in a comic-book shop in the mid-1980s). “The only kind of ‘gatekeepers’ who have any business being around comics,” he writes, “are the ones who make sure the gate stays wide open to anyone who wants to join the fun.” He tells readers, “Skip around! Trust your taste!” His book is helpful for doing just that, with most chapters citing specific issues of magazines, complete with their publication dates and the names of artists and writers, as jumping-off points to reflect on developments in the series. Mr. Wolk notes that part of the fun for new Marvel readers is “being confused and then finding a way out of confusion,” and that “what the story wants from you is not your knowledge but your curiosity.”</td>

      <td>Coco Chanel wanted a signature perfume to accompany her modern fashions. It became unstoppable.</td>
      <td>Every 30 seconds, someone somewhere in the world buys a bottle of Chanel No. 5, the French government declared in 2006, a claim that has often been repeated. Whether it’s still true, or if it ever was, is a company secret, as Chanel’s sales figures were private until 2017. What is certain is that “le monstre,” as Chanel No. 5 is known in the industry, has been a sensation from the moment it appeared in 1921. Coco Chanel created it with the expert “nose” Ernest Beaux as a complement to her radical new fashion. She wanted a fresh, abstract scent that, like her little black dresses, epitomized modern allure.<br />Yet as several books published to coincide with the perfume’s centennial affirm, Chanel No. 5’s enduring success owes as much to ambitious marketing as enticing scent. The history of this promotional juggernaut is laid bare in “Chanel No. 5: Story of a Perfume,” an oversized, lavishly illustrated two-volume boxed set by the French writer Pauline Dreyfus. It completely dwarfs “Chanel No. 5: The Perfume of a Century” (White Star, 64 pages, $16.95) by Italian journalist Chiara Pasqualetti Johnson, a slight, thin book that includes a small selection of some of the same photographs.</td>

But to call it an attempted coup is preposterous—and not simply for the practical reason that the prosecuted rioters weren’t indicted for treason or conspiracy to overthrow the government but for obstruction of an official proceeding, trespassing on government property, disorderly conduct and the like. The idea that Donald Trump and his followers had any chance of overthrowing the U.S. government, or even that they aimed at that outcome, is a delusion. That delusion springs from American liberal elites’ failure to accept the fact of their own predominance.<br />The literary critic Lionel Trilling observed in “The Liberal Imagination” (1950) that “in the United States at this time liberalism is not only the dominant but even the sole intellectual tradition.” He went on to assert that “nowadays there are no conservative or reactionary ideas in general circulation” and that “the conservative impulse and the reactionary impulse do not, with some isolated and some ecclesiastical exceptions, express themselves in ideas but only in action or in irritable mental gestures which seek to resemble ideas.”</td>

      <td>Neither party can afford to alienate the moderate center.</td>
      <td>What exactly is it about wokeness that has evoked such a reaction? Its premise, that there is much racism in U.S. history and in American biases, conscious and unconscious, is not controversial. Who could deny that slavery, Jim Crow and de jure and de facto segregation were not racist, or would argue that their effects could have disappeared entirely?<br />In “Democrats Need to Face Down the Woke” (Declarations, Nov. 13), Peggy Noonan identifies the aspect of wokeness that many find so offensive: the second premise, that “we are not individual persons with souls; we are part of identity groups marked by specific traits.” It is a kind of Calvinism in reverse: If we are not the victims of racism, we are morally fallen, and can do nothing to redeem ourselves. This premise stings, because most of us think of ourselves as good people with free will, or at least aspire to such. When this premise is weaponized politically, it seems manipulative as well as offensive.</td>

      <td>The assault on nationhood, the dissolution of cultural norms and the paradoxes of market globalization demand new solutions.</td>
      <td>Regarding Matthew Continetti’s and Rafael Hoffman’s letters (Nov. 17) about my op-ed “Why America Needs National Conservatism” (Nov. 13): I devoted half the article to the challenge of sustaining American nationhood in the face of a concerted political assault. How can it be said, as Mr. Continetti does, that the term “national” is surplusage in “national conservatism,” with no role in my arguments?<br />The National Conservatism Conference included my talk and a few that Mr. Continetti refers to disapprovingly among around 80 others, including several by liberals and thinkers who cannot be pigeonholed. The conference organizers (I was one) aimed for a diversity of views on issues central to national conservatism. Our discussions produced important convergence on some contentious matters, such as the desirable role of religion in the public square and of tariffs in politics among nations. On other important matters, disagreements remain and are likely to continue. We regard this as a sign of health in our movement, not disarray or crisis.</td>
