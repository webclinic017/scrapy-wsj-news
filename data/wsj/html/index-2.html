      <td>A 6-3 majority recognizes a right to carry guns in public for self-defense.</td>
      <td>The Supreme Court’s 6-3 ruling Thursday on gun rights boils down to this: The Second Amendment doesn’t disappear when you walk out your front door. Stated that way, it sounds obvious, but many appeals judges have disagreed. For a frustrating decade, the Supreme Court was too gun-shy to set them straight, but Justice Clarence Thomas’s majority opinion was worth the wait.<br />New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen challenged the Empire State’s regulations on carrying a firearm in public. Open carry in New York is banned. With certain exceptions, such as for judges, getting a permit to carry a handgun that’s concealed requires demonstrating “proper cause.” That has been interpreted to mean “a special need” for self-defense, beyond that of “the general community or of persons engaged in the same profession.”</td>

Thanks to “regulatory diktats” imposed by the Department of Education in 2011, Judge Cabranes wrote in a concurring opinion earlier this month, campus procedures were so devoid of basic due-process protections that they “compared unfavorably to those of the infamous English Star Chamber.”<br />The Biden administration is bringing back these sham hearings. On Thursday the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights proposed new regulations governing how colleges and universities that receive federal funds—which is nearly all of them—must respond to allegations of sexual misconduct under Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination. The new regulations would eliminate or weaken basic procedural protections for students accused of sexual misconduct.</td>

In a letter last week, he wrote that his administration “is prepared to use all reasonable and appropriate Federal Government tools and emergency authorities to increase refinery capacity and output in the near term.” Yet Mr. Biden’s own policies constrained energy supplies.<br />The U.S. is blessed with an abundance of oil, natural gas and coal that helped us win World War II and gave our citizens the highest living standards in the world. But American families are paying historically high prices at the pump. Mr. Biden can lead the nation out of this self-imposed energy crisis by returning to the policies favored by his predecessors and by many in our party.</td>

This spectacle never got old, no matter my age, but only now do I appreciate how the firefighting tradition crosses generations.<br />One firefighter I admired lived three houses from ours, so he dashed to the firehouse on foot. John Donohue dropped out of high school at 16 and lied about his age to join the Navy during the Korean War. He served the Fair Lawn Volunteer Fire Department for 21 years, during which he rescued two firefighters trapped in a burning diner and later served as fire chief.

Makin is long overdue but still a welcome win for educational choice and pluralism.<br />Maine operates a tuition-assistance program for parents who live in school districts without their own secondary schools. The parents choose a school, public or private, and the state helps them pay to attend. A range of schools are eligible, including ones outside Maine, and many offer elite programming and plush amenities that differ dramatically from public offerings. Yet the state refuses support to families that choose a “sectarian” school—one that “promotes the faith or belief system with which it is associated” or “presents the material taught through the lens of this faith.”</td>

      <td>Liberals and conservatives alike should oppose it.</td>
      <td>When mass shootings such as Uvalde happen, a rallying cry emerges for Congress to do something—anything—to prevent such tragedies in the future. On Tuesday senators introduced the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act—their effort to do something. But when your sole rallying cry is to do something, the thing you do may be worse than the status quo. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act is a terrible bill, and in its current form, it ought to be defeated by a bipartisan political coalition of Congress.<br />Liberals should hate the bill because most of its gun-control provisions are antithetical to their criminal-justice reform agenda. The law expands the categories of those to whom it is unlawful to sell a gun or ammunition to include anyone convicted of a felony as a juvenile. This will ensnare many because the modern definition of a “felony” is exceptionally broad and includes offenses that aren’t particularly serious. The bill also changes the federal prohibition on selling firearms to those who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution. While it excludes involuntary commitments before age 16, the bill significantly strengthens the enforcement of the prohibition against those involuntarily committed between 16 and 18.</td>

In 2017 and 2018, however, the Fed raised the federal-funds rate by 25 basis points at nearly every other meeting. It didn’t look at past policy errors. By mid-2019, the Fed realized it had overtightened and cut rates. In 2020 Covid struck.<br />The Fed conducted town-hall meetings in 2019 and 2020 called “Fed Listens,” after three years of deafness.

      <td>Is the Federal Reserve reviewing the connection between high inflation and the past two years’ U.S. monetary policy? A reporter asked Fed Chairman Jerome Powell that question at a June 15 news conference. After acknowledging that the Fed is doing so “very carefully,” the chairman deflected. He said that for decades inflation was “dominated by disinflationary forces,” but recent history has been plagued by “extraordinary shocks.” Pointing to the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and shutdowns in China, he concluded: “We’re aware that a different set of forces are driving the economy.”<br />Yet Mr. Powell neglected to mention the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies of 2020 and 2021 that surely contributed to upward pressure on prices. More important, he missed the main culprit: the Federal Reserve. The Fed lost control of inflation by abandoning its decadeslong strategy of pre-emptive restraint—that is, tightening before inflation takes hold. That policy, promoted by Fed Chairman Paul Volcker in the 1980s, has delivered price stability for nearly 40 years.</td>

Other times it is defined as a reduction in real gross domestic product for two quarters or more. Strong labor-force and productivity growth are supply-side factors that make a recession less likely, as is recovery from the pandemic.

It was designed by a pseudonymous programmer known as Satoshi Nakamoto, who wanted a money not controlled by government-run central banks.

      <td>The philanthropist and veteran school-reform advocate who served as education secretary under President Trump says the Covid pandemic was an inflection point. “During the last two years, the failings of the school system have been laid bare to families in a way like never before,” Betsy DeVos told me by phone on Monday. “I think it’s hastening the moment in time when we will be able to get significant policy change implemented to support families and kids rather than the system.”<br />That “system” is the subject of Mrs. DeVos’s new book, “Hostages No More: The Fight for Education Freedom and the Future of the American Child.” The title is taken from Horace Mann, the 19th-century politician and educator who is widely credited with founding the public-school apparatus. “We who are engaged in the sacred cause of education,” Mann once wrote, “are entitled to look upon all parents as having given hostages to our cause.” In a book that is part memoir and part school-reform manifesto, Mrs. DeVos makes a compelling case for freeing the hostages.</td>

Some parts of Maine, which is the nation’s most rural state, don’t operate their own high schools. Rather, they send tuition money to the school of the family’s choice. But religious schools are specifically excluded.<br />“That is discrimination against religion,” the Chief Justice writes for a 6-3 majority in Carson v. Makin. Maine’s policy thus infringes on the Constitution’s guarantee of religious “free exercise.” This case is similar to one the Court heard from Montana two years ago. As the Chief wrote then: “A State need not subsidize private education. But once a State decides to do so, it cannot disqualify some private schools solely because they are religious.”</td>

The U.S. should spoil Russia’s strategy by establishing a maritime corridor with a naval coalition of the willing to ensure Ukrainian grain can reach foreign ports. That would alleviate the global food crisis while undermining a key element of Russian leverage over Ukraine and its allies.<br />From his initial military buildup, Vladimir Putin has aimed to shock Kyiv and the West into submission without having to martial the forces necessary to conquer Ukraine outright. Moscow has pushed to achieve objectives that aren’t geostrategic in the usual sense of allowing Russian forces an easier military victory, but that instead could put pressure on Ukraine’s allies to back off and force President Volodymyr Zelensky to capitulate.</td>

Governments must make their countries’ economic interests the priority and address the cost-of-living crisis.<br />Adopting the European Commission’s minimum-tax directive now would be a profound mistake. The directive is based on rules published in 2021 by a group of more than 100 countries collaborating to address tax challenges in the digital economy. It has two pillars: The first aims to put an end to big tech firms’ tax avoidance by making them pay their fair share of tax where their activities are performed and where their profit is created. The second aims to introduce a minimum 15% tax on corporate profit world-wide to put a floor on tax competition. The global tax deal was planned to come into force in 2023, but in May OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann announced that it may take longer to implement.</td>

      <td>Actually, today’s oil price isn’t that high. The recent peak of $128, after inflation, is still $33 lower than the price in April 2011. For all the talk of Ukraine, 55% of the current increase since last December occurred prior to the Russian invasion. Even more important to note: The rise in retail gasoline has been disproportionately large in relation to the underlying oil price hike. If gasoline had risen as much in April 2011, consumers would have paid the equivalent of $6.72 a gallon (in fact, they paid about $5 in 2022 dollars).<br />So something else is going on and that something is a normal adjustment to an abnormal event: a two-year global pandemic that knocked gasoline demand for a loop. It caused dozens of refineries to be idled, some of which (especially in the U.S.) were so creaky that it made no sense to restart them. Then, on top of these supply-demand effects, add 13% cumulative inflation since early 2020.</td>

But beneath the public relations, voters should observe the broad administrative campaign to make energy more expensive. As if Washington doesn’t already have enough environmental regulators, Biden appointees with no expertise on the subject and no authorization from Congress are attempting to enact climate rules that don’t even appear to be legal. That’s the warning from former leaders of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who must be wondering what on earth has become of the capital markets overseer they used to run.<br />Last week this column noted the pushback from Senate Republicans to a pending SEC rule that would impose on companies of all kinds vast new reporting requirements on global-warming risks. This is the Biden whole-of-government approach to discouraging the use of fossil fuels, forcing companies to publish more data that may have no impact on profitability but will be useful for climate activists seeking to attack business. Now in a new letter to the commission, former SEC chairmen Richard Breeden and Harvey Pitt and former SEC commissioners Philip Lochner, Richard Roberts and Paul Atkins explain how the pending rule would pollute company reports with politics:</td>

He believes Congress’s current effort to provide $50 billion in subsidies to American semiconductor companies, in the hope that they will become industry leaders, is “a very expensive exercise in futility.” While he may be correct that U.S. firms are unlikely to overtake TSMC, that isn’t the point: Complete dependence on Taiwan for advanced semiconductors puts American national security at risk.<br />TSMC manufactures 92% of the advanced semiconductors necessary for every smartphone, laptop and ballistic missile. U.S. firms such as Nvidia, Qualcomm and  Apple  outsource almost all their manufacturing to Taiwan. If Taiwan’s chip manufacturing capacity went offline or fell into China’s hands, America’s technology sector would be devastated. As former Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work has warned, conflict in the Taiwan Strait could spark a national-security crisis over chips: “We’re 110 miles”—the distance from Taipei to the mainland—“away from going from two generations ahead to maybe two generations behind.”</td>

Even after the latest flurry of gaffes, strong and serious leadership from President Biden can put a vital relationship back on its feet.<br />Democratic opposition to the U.S.-Saudi relationship began soon after Franklin D. Roosevelt met with King Abdul Aziz aboard the Navy heavy cruiser USS Quincy in 1945. The Eisenhower administration’s preference for good relations with the Arab world over support for Israel struck many contemporary Democrats as a favor to American oil companies heavily invested in the kingdom. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ predatory pricing during the 1970s made Arabs generally—and Saudis especially—unpopular. Saudi treatment of women infuriated American feminists, and as climate activists grew more influential in Democratic politics, Saudi oil was seen as a threat to the planet. The Saudi origins of the 9/11 bombers combined with the close ties between the Bush family and the Saudi royals taught a new generation of Democratic activists to loathe the House of Saud.</td>

Through her instinctual hyperpartisanship, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has nearly succeeded in turning what should have been a thorough investigation of the causes of that terrible event into a show trial of her political enemies. Keeping critics off the committee and letting its proceedings be run without a word of dissent undermines its legitimacy and persuasive force.

Wealthy countries admonish developing ones to use renewable energy. Last month the Group of Seven went so far as to announce they would no longer fund fossil-fuel development abroad. Meanwhile, Europe and the U.S. are begging Arab nations to expand oil production. Germany is reopening coal power plants, and Spain and Italy are spending big on African gas production. So many European countries have asked Botswana to mine more coal that the nation will more than double its exports.<br />The developed world became wealthy through the pervasive use of fossil fuels, which still overwhelmingly power most of its economies. Solar and wind power aren’t reliable, simply because there are nights, clouds and still days. Improving battery storage won’t help much: There are enough batteries in the world today only to power global average electricity consumption for 75 seconds. Even though the supply is being scaled up rapidly, by 2030 the world’s batteries would still cover less than 11 minutes. Every German winter, when solar output is at its minimum, there is near-zero wind energy available for at least five days—or more than 7,000 minutes.</td>

This policy compromise could save lives.<br />We are part of a team from eight universities, funded by the National Collaborative on Gun Violence Research, that is analyzing ERPO petitions across six states. Our preliminary findings show the scale of mass-shooting threats is larger than we could have imagined. We found that 9.5% of orders are for mass-shooting threats—that’s 626 cases from 2013-20 in which there’s a credible threat presented to a judge.</td>

      <td>As the nine Justices prepare to issue their final opinions of the current term, barricades are going up around the Supreme Court building. It’s a sad but necessary security measure because violence can’t be ruled out in response to the rulings.<br />The threat is explicit on abortion, as the arrest of an armed man outside Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s home attests. Demonstrators continue to protest outside the homes of some Justices, and now comes a vow from the shadowy group that calls itself Jane’s Revenge to commit what sounds like what Democrats would call insurrection if it were aimed at another part of government.</td>

      <td>The French President’s legislative allies lose their majority, as parties on the left and right rise.</td>
      <td>The French political system is designed to empower the President, and Emmanuel Macron has enjoyed sweeping authority in his first five years in the Elysée Palace. But legislative elections on the weekend ensured his second term will be far more complicated.<br />Mr. Macron easily won a second mandate in April, but on Sunday his allies lost control of the National Assembly. His centrist Ensemble block won 245 seats, well short of the 289 needed for an absolute majority. It’s a significant fall from the 350 Mr. Macron’s group won in 2017.</td>

      <td>In a perfect world, public companies would compensate their executives commensurate with the creation of long-term shareholder value.<br />Last year, the median compensation for U.S. chief executives reached a record high for the sixth consecutive year, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month. While most pay packages are bolstered by restricted stock units that might never pay off, several handsomely paid executives last year helmed newly public companies that saw their stocks pop and quickly flop. A close examination of their incentives indicates that some packages proved far more shareholder-friendly than others.</td>
