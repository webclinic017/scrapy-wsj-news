      <td>His opposition to Build Back Better gives Biden a chance to change course.</td>
      <td>Joe Manchin’s decision on Sunday to oppose the Build Back Better Act is a service to the country, sparing it from huge tax increases and new entitlements that would fan inflation and erode the incentive for Americans to work. Paradoxically, it is also a blessing for Democrats if they get the message, and it offers President Biden a chance to reboot.<br />“My Democratic colleagues in Washington are determined to dramatically reshape our society in a way that leaves our country more vulnerable to the threats we face,” the West Virginia Democrat said in a statement after announcing his opposition on Fox News Sunday. “I cannot take that risk with a staggering debt of more than $29 trillion and inflation taxes that are real and harmful to every hard-working American at the gasoline pumps, grocery stores and utility bills with no end in sight.”</td>

      <td>The progressive whiz kids who run President Biden’s White House don’t have much sense of self-restraint—or common political sense. Their response on Sunday to Sen. Joe Manchin’s opposition to Build Back Better was to accuse him of bad faith while saying they’ll beat him up until he changes his mind.<br />Press secretary Jen Psaki issued a blistering statement saying Mr. Manchin’s comments on Fox News Sunday “are at odds with his discussions this week with the President, with White House staff, and with his own public utterances.” We can’t speak for his private White House talks, but Mr. Manchin’s public comments have been consistent for months. On Sunday he finally said no.</td>

It wasn’t true at the time, but Congress passed some $325 billion in direct funding for states and localities in March anyway, and now most are swimming in cash. The good news is that some states are now returning some of the money to taxpayers, and the latest is Arkansas.<br />Gov. Asa Hutchinson recently signed legislation that reduces the top state income-tax rate to 5.5% from 5.9%, effective New Year’s Day. The rate will continue to drop in stages to 4.9% by 2025. The reform simplifies the tax code by combining the bottom two income thresholds into one that would pay a rate of 4.9%.</td>

But are we again vulnerable to a host of diseases, plus many inconveniences we’ve long forgotten? Life moves pretty fast. I don’t know if most folks are ready.</td>

Precatórios are a government expense that operate like government-issued bonds when they go unpaid. At that stage, they often are resold on the secondary market as sovereign debt.</td>

Besides teacher, preacher, Civil War soldier and spy, he was a congressman, author, lecturer, spiritualist, anarchist and early advocate for the rights of women and African-Americans, to mention a few of the pursuits to which he turned his probing mind and restless energy. Though Kelso is little remembered today, Christopher Grasso argues that the man embodied the political and philosophical currents running through his times.<br />Born in 1831, Kelso grew up in backwoods Ohio and Missouri. He was humiliated by his family’s poverty, and from an early age believed he was destined for something greater than hardscrabble farming. Though he had virtually no formal schooling, he nurtured his ambition by devouring the few books he could find. By the time he was a teenager, he was master of the local school and a preacher in the Methodist church. At 18, after quarreling with his father, he left home and supported himself as a quarryman, river boatman and itinerant schoolteacher. Before age 30, he had broken with the church, earned a college degree, married, divorced, remarried, fathered four children and opened a private academy in Buffalo, Mo., in the southwestern corner of the state.</td>

But this time Washington has misjudged the threat. We need to recalibrate our strategy.<br />The U.S. would be lucky if Mr. Putin honestly wants to negotiate. He’s moved more than 120,000 troops into position for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Putin comically refers to the military buildup as a “training exercise,” but there’s no mistaking the purpose of a force that size. And if such an invasion is successful, Ukraine could be only his first stop. Our nearby allies, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia—and the thousands of American troops stationed there—could be next. That’s why I recently went to Ukraine to ensure the U.S. is prepared. But I found that Ukrainian and American plans aren’t properly aligned to deter Russian aggression.</td>

The Federal Reserve now acknowledges that high inflation has persisted too long and signals that it will raise interest rates, though probably not as much as needed. For the first time since 1980, inflation has become a political issue.<br />In public statements, President Biden has attributed inflation to supply-chain bottlenecks and temporary price spikes on cars and price-gouging by businesses. Supply bottlenecks have clearly pushed up prices, but robust growth in aggregate demand driven by excessive monetary and fiscal stimulus has been a primary source of inflation. The supply constraints will eventually dissipate. Policy makers can’t wait to tone down the bulging pipeline of monetary and fiscal stimulus.</td>

      <td>Kevin Warsh overstates the Fed’s responsibility for inflation (“The Fed Is the Main Inflation Culprit,” op-ed, Dec. 13). The Fed’s bond buying and its zero-interest-rate policy may have contributed, but they are not the main reason inflation has accelerated. The Fed purchased a large amount of securities between late 2008 and 2014 and kept the funds rate at zero from late 2008 to December 2015, and inflation remained below the Fed’s 2% target.<br />Mr. Warsh ignores the role of the Cares Act. The act gave individuals and businesses trillions. A significant amount of this money went to people who didn’t need it—those with twice the median income. The money giveaway was the equivalent of a helicopter money drop. Most economists believe that a very large helicopter money drop would produce inflation. It is likely the Cares Act is the main inflation culprit.</td>

That not all the Asians qualified for admission to professional schools and elite colleges get in is beside the point. The same may be said of many students of all hues who feel themselves “victimized” by others’ admission ahead of them.<br />Admitting the arrogant is not the goal of higher-education admissions professionals. Rather, admission to the elite, most competitive schools has broader, more expansive societal and higher-education goals—including that of reversing the decades-old preferences that were accorded to whites and disadvantaged and effectively excluded qualified blacks and Hispanics from the ranks of the best and brightest.</td>

A refreshing, sweet-savory drink, the cucumber vodka, like all Hanson vodkas, is certified organic. What’s not to love?<br />It’s a question worth asking because, for years, vodka hasn’t gotten much love from mixologists. The generation that brought the classic cocktail revival has had little use for a spirit not found in pre-Prohibition recipes. They’ve condemned industrial vodka’s wan character and the chemicals that give it flavors like bubble gum and peanut-butter-and-jelly. An Internet search of a decade’s-worth of bartender opinions on vodka yielded venom, such as: “The people who put together crap like this do no respect to me or the drinking public.”</td>

When people introduce me at a public event, they often mention how long I’ve been married, and the listeners always applaud. My thought when this happens is: Isn’t that the way marriage is supposed to work? But perhaps marriage doesn’t always look that way these days, and after some reminiscing, Kay and I thought that some readers might enjoy our story—since, fitting the season, it is a story of hope and love.<br />My family moved to Tulsa, Okla., when I was 6. We lived about three houses away from Kay, who was 4. We grew up friends, never once thinking we’d date or have any sort of romance together. Then, when I was 25, I thought to myself: She’s been here all this time, and I didn’t know it. Who else would I ever want to marry? That was quite a thought for a 25-year-old. She was, and still is, unlike any other person I have ever met. Our engagement came soon after our first date.</td>

It is the least bureaucratic, least intrusive and most efficient way to support families and children. But the U.S. child tax credit has left out some of the families who need it most: those who don’t earn enough to qualify. Congress passed temporary changes to the credit earlier this year, increasing the size of the credit, paying out part of it in monthly checks, and allowing those without income to receive the benefit.

Rare is the person they’d fit and, given their thick seams, rarer still the shoes. Christmas stockings are symbolic gift containers, not hosiery.<br />But one of the Colkets’ stockings is different. It’s long and skinny, with a diamond checkered pattern knitted in cream and brown and darned with scattered bits of bright red yarn. “It was a men’s stocking my grandfather wore when golfing and wearing his plus fours,” explains Andrew Colket, who got the stocking from his father as a child and last year passed it down for his son’s first Christmas.</td>

      <td>Victorian archaeologists dug to test a Christian idea of the heavenly city. Modern Israelis have a different idea.</td>
      <td>In “Civilization and Its Discontents,” Freud compared memory and its recovery to the archaeology of Rome. The visitor cannot see the earlier layers of civilization, but the guidebook says where they once were. This allows us to look at the Colosseum and imagine the Golden House of Nero below.  But, Freud wrote, a single physical space cannot hold “two different contents.” If it did, then the Palazzo Caffarelli would occupy the same spot as the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, and we would see the temple in both its early, Etruscan form and its later, imperial form.<br />Freud never saw Jerusalem. Not only is its visitor’s imagination incited by the Bible, the guidebook of guidebooks, but Jerusalem’s archaeology also presents the simultaneity that Freud thought impossible. The sacred core of Jerusalem is so great that, like New York, they named it twice: Raise your head as you emerge from the warren of the Old City, and you see the Temple Mount of the Jews and the Noble Sanctuary of the Muslims. Two different contents, two different contexts—not forgetting the Christians, who cannot agree among themselves where their sacred sites should be.</td>

      <td>Eighty years ago this month, the American entry into World War II was precipitated by the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. But the ensuing clash in the war’s Pacific theater has long been overshadowed in American memory by the battles in Europe. Compared to the famed ordeals of the Normandy invasion and the Battle of the Bulge, the battles of Guadalcanal, Saipan and Okinawa pale in the popular imagination. This skewed perspective unfairly slights the brave men who fought against Japanese aggression, and distorts our understanding of the conflict’s legacy. As the historian Richard Overy observes in “Blood and Ruins: The Great Imperial War, 1931-1945,” his magisterial new history of World War II, “the Asian war and its consequences were as important to the creation of the post-war world as the defeat of Germany in Europe, arguably more so.”<br />To the extent that the Pacific theater still lives in the American imagination, the Marines, who fought with splendid valor, play a starring role. The HBO miniseries “The Pacific” (2010) ranged across the sprawling theater of conflict but focused almost exclusively on the experiences of young Marines. One of the most iconic photographs of the 20th century is of six Marines hoisting the flag on Mount Suribachi during the Battle of Iwo Jima. It may be that the Marines are as adept at public relations as they are courageous on the battlefield. But the U.S. Army fielded 1.8 million men in the fight against Japan, several times as many as the Marine Corps.</td>
