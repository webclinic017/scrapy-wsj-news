PPP provided forgivable loans to keep workers paid and businesses whole while the economy went into a government-ordered cryogenic freeze.

Eighty-three percent of Generation X and 77% of millennials say they worry that the program will run out of money in their lifetimes, according to a June 2021 Harris poll for the Nationwide Retirement Institute. The latest report of the Social Security Trustees backs them up, finding that the Old Age and Survivors Insurance trust fund “will be able to pay scheduled benefits on a timely basis until 2034, one year later than reported last year.” That’s only 12 years from now.<br />When Congress passed the Social Security Act of 1935, 42 people worked for each 65-year-old retiree. The trust fund ran surpluses for years. But as life spans grew longer and birthrates declined, fewer wage earners were called on to support more retirees. By the start of the Covid pandemic, there were only 2.7 workers per retiree.</td>

The president is right on both counts, just not in the way that he and other gun-control enthusiasts imagine.<br />Voters have noticed that cities where shootings occur almost daily also have some of the strictest gun laws. Using common sense, they’ve concluded that more gun-control legislation probably isn’t the solution because criminals by definition don’t respect laws. Many of the same people likewise find it unconscionable that elected officials would make it more difficult for law-abiding residents of high-crime neighborhoods to arm themselves for protection.</td>

These topics should be addressed in a forum where there can be discussion with opposing views and in-depth conversation rather than with a pastoral monologue with quips and sound bites, as if one speaks ex officio for God regarding politics.<br />From my Lutheran perspective, the purpose of worship is to preach the Gospel, praise God and administer the sacraments.

In 1990 Margaret Thatcher won by a similar margin (204-152), yet the opposition from within the Conservative ranks was enough to force her to stand down. In 2018 Theresa May won by a wider margin (200-117), only to resign six months later. History suggests that Monday’s vote leaves Mr. Johnson mortally wounded. Yet these are unusual times, and he is an exceptional politician.<br />The vote was not about Mr. Johnson’s policies, disarrayed and unpopular though they are. It was about his greatest strength and weakness—his outsize personality—and his government’s handling of an unprecedented challenge, the Covid-19 pandemic. Its economic hangover shows little sign of abating, and the mood in the U.K., as in other Western democracies, is bitter. The bureaucrats who devised the lockdowns and masking rituals are beyond the public’s wrath, but the elected leaders who took their advice are vulnerable. As President Biden may find in November, Mr. Johnson’s humbling is a foretaste of voters’ revenge.</td>

The headline inflation numbers are increasingly similar—around 8% in both the U.S. and Europe—but the causes, consequences and treatment remain quite different. In particular, the U.S. has higher underlying inflation—which is potentially more persistent and is appropriately being treated with aggressive monetary tightening. In contrast, more of Europe’s inflation is imported—which makes it more painful than U.S. inflation but also likely more transitory, and so the European Central Bank should follow a comparatively restrained response.<br />The U.S. has had about 3 percentage points more cumulative inflation than the euro area since the onset of the pandemic. But inflation peaked in March in the U.S. and is likely to continue drifting down, while inflation rates have been rising in Europe. In the first four months of the year, inflation rose at a 12% annualized rate in Europe compared with 9% in the U.S.</td>

It’s a remarkable development only two-and-a-half years after he won a historic parliamentary majority of 80 seats, including districts that had never voted Tory.

Mr. Shapiro is a libertarian-minded legal scholar who sometimes writes for these pages. Georgetown, like most law schools, is dominated by progressives, often of the intolerant and vindictive variety.</td>

Sunrun ,   Sunnova Energy ,   Sunpower  and  Enphase Energy  are some of the home solar firms that should benefit, it says. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)</td>

My discomfort as a person of faith with politicians offering “thoughts and prayers” in the wake of school shootings isn’t because I don’t value the potency of prayer, but rather because these statements are offered as a cheap palliative by those who should be effecting meaningful change.<br />Rabbi Bashevkin quotes Lincoln: “I have been driven many times upon my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go.” Perhaps this is the issue; our leaders pray, overwhelmed by a conviction that there is nothing else to do, when there is so much yet to be done.</td>

In 2006 Mr. Bicknell sold what was once the world’s biggest megachain of Pizza Huts, with something like 800 stores and 22,000 employees. That year Pizza Hut’s Super Bowl ad featured the singer Jessica Simpson crooning about a crust made of 28 “poppable” cheesy bites.<br />Mr. Bicknell has been battling the Kansas Revenue Department ever since. He originally lived there but in 2003 sought to switch his residency to Florida, which has no income tax. Kansas disputed the move and dunned him $43 million, including on the Pizza Huts. There were multiple trials and trips to appeals courts. “We hold Gene was domiciled in Florida,” the Kansas Supreme Court ruled last month.</td>

      <td>His predecessors have faced big Congressional losses. Here’s what he can learn from their mistakes.</td>
      <td>In 1986 the Republican Party lost the Senate majority, marking the first time in more than three decades that a sitting president’s party had lost a chamber of Congress. In the 3½ decades since, presidents have seen their parties lose control of one or both houses in five midterm elections, and every president since Bill Clinton has experienced such a loss. Political experts take it as a foregone conclusion that President Biden’s Democrats will face that same fate this fall.<br />Is there anything a president can do? Mr. Biden and his team would be wise to study the experiences of his predecessors. History provides a playbook for what to do to prepare for a midterm reckoning—and what to do should the opposing party take control.</td>

The Abraham Accords, established in 2020, have created economic and diplomatic benefits for the four countries that agreed to normalize relations with the Jewish state. But an opposing coalition has effectively formed out of states, political parties and militias allied with Iran, Qatar and Kuwaiti extremist financiers.<br />Last month Iraq’s Parliament passed an “anti-normalization law” prescribing death for the slightest contact with an Israeli citizen. Last week saw calls to enact similar laws by Parliament members and militias from North Africa to the Gulf. Yemen, controlled by the Iran-backed Houthi movement, passed similar legislation Thursday. Ahead of President Biden’s trip to Israel, the Palestinian areas, Saudi Arabia and possibly other Arab states, this axis of resistance threatens to block diplomatic efforts to expand the Abraham Accords or even to reverse some of the progress. The administration must help Arab peace advocates stop it.</td>

It also provides new evidence that she personally directed the effort.<br />In July 2016, John Brennan, then director of the Central Intelligence Agency, briefed President Obama that Mrs. Clinton gave “approval” for a “proposal from one of her foreign policy advisors to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up scandal and claiming interference by the Russian security service,” according to Mr. Brennan’s notes from the meeting, which were obtained by Fox News.</td>

This line of argument shows why the president’s team and the experts at the Federal Reserve were unable to anticipate the inflation conundrum that their economic missteps have forced us into. It also shows why the president’s plan will likely fail to allow us to exit inflation with a smooth landing.<br />We don’t have a global inflation problem. Inflations are always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon spawned by the creation of excess money by local central banks. China, Japan and Switzerland also face elevated oil prices, supply-chain problems and fallout from the war in Ukraine, but their annual inflation rates are 2.1%, 2.5% and 2.5%, respectively. They have avoided the ravages of inflation because their central banks haven’t produced excessive quantities of money.</td>

Mr. Cheffins correctly explains the legal transformation but misses our point on the economic transformation. The 1720 Bubble Act effectively banned new joint stock companies but didn’t eliminate existing corporations. Without the predations of stakeholder capitalism, the latter grew in value by 48% over the ensuing century. When resources were lacking, “big projects went to large partnerships,” according to Harvard Prof. David Landes. “In the nineteenth century, when things got costlier and risks greater,” Parliament turned to “the most effective device for mobilizing capital . . . , the chartered joint stock company.”</td>
