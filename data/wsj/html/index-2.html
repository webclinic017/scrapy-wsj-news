      <td>Based on the French series ‘Call My Agent!,’ the show follows the ups and downs of a turbulent London talent agency.</td>
      <td>Based on the French series “Call My Agent!” and set in London, the eight-part “Ten Percent” is the sort of fiction whose appeal, emotional or other, will at first seem elusive. The lead characters in John Morton’s drama—employees of the Nightingale Hart talent agency including agency head Richard Nightingale (Jim Broadbent); his son and colleague Jonathan (Jack Davenport); senior partner Stella Hart (Maggie Steed); and fellow agents Rebecca Fox (Lydia Leonard) and Dan Bala (Prasanna Puwanarajah)—are, at first sight, flat, undistinguished and predictable as they go about their task of finding work for clients hoping to secure their place in show business. But it’s a measure of the speed with which writer-director Morton’s skills make themselves felt that “Ten Percent” quickly establishes something close to a perfect blend of satire and geniality in this portrait of a ruthlessly competitive world. One of the most compelling performances in a work amply endowed with them, and in which prominent British actors sometimes play themselves, is that of Tim McInnerny as the aging actor and original Nightingale client Simon Gould.<br />In the opening episode, the British staff at Nightingale Hart is faced with an increasing array of challenges—its trusted guide and leader, Richard, dies. It is faced, additionally, with a possibility more troubling than any other—there are signs that Americans are moving in for a takeover. But this is not the only challenge confronting the British dug in at Nightingale Hart. An American executive is planning a personal visit. Given the described tenor of life in the place, he won’t lack for matters of interest to report.</td>

As much, if not more, than any musical, the show is indelibly associated with its original star, Barbra Streisand, around whom it was molded, if not shrink-wrapped, after she was cast. And as anyone who has watched her career knows—and most are at least aware of its contours—Ms. Streisand is a talent as singular as any in American popular culture.</td>

He sponsored Chicago’s Museum of Science and Industry and established more than 5,000 schools for African-Americans in the Jim Crow South.<br />It was Rosenwald’s desire to discontinue his foundation upon his passing. He believed that his contributions were needed only during the time that he could guide his efforts. He passed on his wealth to his children, all of whom became philanthropists themselves. It would be a dream to think that today’s plutocrats could feel as comfortable discontinuing their influence in a timely fashion.</td>

      <td>The old-school supermodel staple has lately been spotted on everyone from Kendall Jenner to Kaia Gerber. Here, tips for wearing the season’s jacket sensation.</td>
      <td>WE TRIED. We really did, but we couldn’t think of an A-List actress who didn’t wear a leather blazer in the 1990s. Gwyneth Paltrow voted for a black one—as did her character Helen Quilley in 1998’s “Sliding Doors.” Reese Witherspoon went for a wine-colored version, paired with chunky black boots and brownish lipstick, at the 1996 red-carpet premiere of “2 Days in the Valley.” And Jennifer Aniston, at the peak of her “Friends” fame, slipped on a camel style in the Mrs. Whiskerson episode (1999), drolly sporting it alongside a cat that had no coat at all. Also devotees? Claire Danes, Julia Roberts, Jada Pinkett Smith, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Jessica Parker, Winona Ryder and Naomi Campbell.<br />Cindy Crawford, a much-documented fan of the leather blazer pre-Y2K, recently revived the look alongside her mirror-image daughter, Kaia Gerber, bringing the piece full circle. Along with Ms. Gerber, Bella Hadid, Emily Ratajkowski and Hailey Bieber are among the new generation of celebrities gravitating toward the garment. Gucci has brought it back (embossed all over with the label’s logo) as have Saint Laurent (long and single-breasted) and Versace (slim and shrunken). Brigitte Chartrand, vice president of womenswear buying at retailer Ssense, who’s stocked that Versace take, called it her favorite modern interpretation of the trend. “It’s so emblematic [of the era] and we haven’t seen much of this specific style since Gwyneth and Winona wore it in the ’90s,” she said. New York stylist Tyler Okuns points to notable versions by the Row, Khaite and David Koma, while Los Angeles stylist Erin Walsh calls out designs by Staud and Nanushka as her top picks.</td>

Like Mao, Mr. Xi’s position within the Chinese Communist Party is rock-solid. Yet the grass-roots effort he has mobilized against Covid is gathering internal momentum and is increasingly likely to last past the National Party Congress in October.</td>

The hotel where the release took place is immediately sealed off. A computer modeling genius figures out not only how the disease will spread, but how quickly news of the disease will get around and (the best part) how bad traffic will get as people flee the city. I remember watching those episodes and thinking, “Wow, that government sure knew how to prepare.” It made for great TV, and of course we could all sleep better at night if things really worked that way.<br />But they don’t. Although there are many organizations that work hard to respond to a major outbreak, their efforts largely depend on volunteers. Regional and national response teams are understaffed and underfunded, and none of them has a mandate from the international community to work globally. The only organization that sort of has that mandate, the World Health Organization (WHO), has very little funding and almost no personnel dedicated to pandemics, relying instead on the mostly volunteer Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). There is no organization with the size, scope, resources and responsibility that are essential for detecting and responding to outbreaks and preventing them from becoming pandemics.</td>

(Election Day is May 7.) The first lets state legislators reduce the cap on the property taxes that school districts assess on residents over age 65. Like many other states, property taxes in Texas are levied by county and local governments, and schools get the biggest cut.

      <td>As the labor force expands, consumer demand cools, and the ‘great resignation’ proves illusory, the balance will shift toward employers.</td>
      <td>When employers are in great need of relatively scarce workers, the balance of power in the labor market shifts. This was made clear this month when pro-union  Amazon  employees in Staten Island, N.Y., won a long-shot victory and when the second  Starbucks  location in the company’s hometown of Seattle voted to unionize. These major wins for organized labor have energized the labor movement at a time when it was already on the rise. The number of union-representation petitions filed with the National Labor Relations Board has surged by 57% over the past six months relative to the same period a year ago.<br />More broadly, workers are in the driver’s seat. This shows up in employer concessions on working conditions, flexibility and benefits and in wage growth. Last month nominal average wages for nonsupervisory workers increased at a 6.7% annual rate. Though this pace isn’t fast enough to keep up with inflation, it is considerably faster than the pre-pandemic norm. Nominal average wages in the leisure and hospitality sector increased by 11.8%.</td>

Etienne Gerard. In one adventure, Gerard is penned within Dartmoor prison, an institution opened in 1809 to confine soldiers and sailors captured by Britain in a war with France that had already lasted 16 years.<br />It was not only Frenchmen who were incarcerated inside the grim, granite-built jail. From the spring of 1813, the inmates were joined by Americans taken prisoner during the War of 1812. In two years, more than 6,500 American prisoners of war passed through Dartmoor’s main gateway, filing beneath a stone arch inscribed with the motto parcere subjectis—spare the vanquished.</td>

Maybe enact another $10 billion in Covid relief or wave a wand that erases student-loan debt. Normally I’d say good luck with that, but the party is beyond luck.</td>

As the tying run scored, Mr. Kwan fell to the grass, obviously hurt. The fans’ roar turned then into that awful emotion of victorious vengeance. “Take that” was the unspoken message.</td>

Vladimir Putin and his advisers have issued nuclear warnings throughout the war in Ukraine, threatening the U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with attack if they escalate their involvement. Moscow recently threatened Sweden and Finland with a pre-emptive strike if they join NATO.<br />The reality is that unless the U.S. prepares to win a nuclear war, it risks losing one. Robert C. O’Brien, a former White House national security adviser, proposed a series of conventional responses, which are necessary but not sufficient to deter Russian nuclear escalation. Developing a coherent American strategy requires understanding why Russia threatens to use nuclear weapons and how the U.S. can recalibrate its strategic logic for a nuclear environment.</td>

      <td>What could be wrong with giving the IRS more time to audit omissions of income? Quite a bit.</td>
      <td>Buried on page 82 of the Biden administration budget’s proposed tax changes for 2023 is a section that would give the Internal Revenue Service more time to audit individuals and large companies. Current law limits the IRS to three years to assess a tax deficiency, except if a taxpayer appears to have failed to report at least 25% of income, in which case the agency gets six years. There’s no time limit if the suspected omissions are deliberate. The Biden proposal would change this standard by also allowing six years if the IRS believes the taxpayer has unintentionally omitted more than $100 million from a return.<br />On the surface, this may appear a reasonable measure. It’s appropriate for the IRS to audit corporations that fail to report income, and $100 million sure seems like a lot of money. But it’s complicated.</td>

If the government can’t be trusted to enforce its contract with student borrowers on behalf of taxpayers, it shouldn’t enter into the contract at all.<br />Ceasing to shower money on anyone who wants to go college would increase the value of a college education.

      <td>Regarding your editorial “Cut Tariffs to Help Inflation and Ukraine” (April 18): First, President Trump’s tariffs on China were put in place as a result of a rigorous legal process and are designed to counter serious unfair and predatory practices. The U.S. is being threatened in the economic sphere by a dangerous and increasingly aggressive adversary. Rolling back the tariffs would essentially give the adversary a pass to cheat and cost many Americans their jobs. The China challenge is more important to the long-term prosperity and security of our country than the current inflation.<br />Second, the notion that these tariffs are inflationary, regardless of the economic benefit from challenging Chinese behavior, is questionable at best. The tariffs were in place for two years during the Trump administration and there was no significant inflation. I know that economists have their concocted models but that is the reality.</td>

Add a loaf of bread and a make-ahead spiced green sauce to drag slices of chicken through. I like to place the platters right on the table and let guests pass them around, to share and come back for more as they wish. This passing and re-passing not only puts people in charge of what goes on their plates; it also creates a natural movement and connection that feeds more than just bellies.</td>
