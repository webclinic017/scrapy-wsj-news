Yet as Ms. Sinema calmly explained, she is refusing to go along with the President’s bullying precisely because of her democratic convictions.</td>

      <td>The U.S. must hold the line against their imperial ambitions in Ukraine, Taiwan and elsewhere.</td>
      <td>Intellectuals can’t stop denouncing the West for its legacy of imperialism. But the imperialism on the march today is in the East. Russia and China are determined to consume Ukraine and Taiwan, legacies of the Romanov and Qing dynasties respectively, into the latest versions of their historical empires. Technology has intensified this struggle for imperial geography. Great-power war has become entirely imaginable because of the reduced emphasis on thermonuclear bombs in an era of hypersonic missiles, automated weapons systems, and information warfare. Russia and China demonstrate that the struggle for empire has rarely had such nerve-racking stakes.<br />The notion that we can play Russia off against China—as the Nixon administration played China off against the Soviet Union—is a fantasy. President Biden’s reward for giving up opposition to Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany has been the advance of nearly 100,000 Russian troops to the Ukrainian border area. National security adviser Henry Kissinger’s secret 1971 visit to Beijing occurred in the context of dramatic military tensions on the Chinese-Soviet frontier. China was in desperate need of U.S. help. Russia today has no such need.</td>

On seemingly every front in the battle against the coronavirus, the messages are muddled: Test or don’t test? Which test? When? Isolate or not? For five days? Ten? Go to school or not? See friends and resume normal life, or hunker down again?”<br />Deferring to the experts appears central to many people’s value systems and political identities and is emphasized relentlessly by the Biden administration and the media. For people who have staked their lives on doing whatever the experts tell them to do, the strange unity of confusion has induced an epistemic crisis.</td>

Sorry, the biggest culprits here are the pandemic and the surge in federal payments to individuals.<br />The Internal Revenue Service usually enters tax-filing season with a backlog of a million returns, but Treasury says this year the agency faces “several times” more.

      <td>He thought he was merely appealing to his base. He might have united the rest of the country against him.</td>
      <td>It is startling when two speeches within 24 hours, neither much heralded in advance—the second wouldn’t even have been given without the first—leave you knowing you have witnessed a seminal moment in the history of an administration, but it happened this week. The president’s Tuesday speech in Atlanta, on voting rights, was a disaster for him. By the end of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s answering speech on Wednesday you knew some new break point had occurred, that President Biden might have thought he was just crooning to part of his base but the repercussions were greater than that; he was breaking in some new way with others—and didn’t know it. It is poor political practice when you fail to guess the effects of your actions. He meant to mollify an important constituency but instead he filled his opponents with honest indignation and, I suspect, encouraged in that fractured group some new unity.<br />The speech itself was aggressive, intemperate, not only offensive but meant to offend. It seemed prepared by people who think there is only the Democratic Party in America, that’s it, everyone else is an outsider who can be disparaged. It was a mistake on so many levels. Presidents more than others in politics have to maintain an even strain, as astronauts used to say. If a president is rhetorically manipulative and divisive on a voting-rights bill it undercuts what he’s trying to establish the next day on Covid and the economy. The over-the-top language of the speech made him seem more emotional, less competent. The portentousness—“In our lives and . . . the life of our nation, there are moments so stark that they divide all that came before them from everything that followed. They stop time”—made him appear incapable of understanding how the majority of Americans understand our own nation’s history and the vast array of its challenges.</td>

In contrast, the personal lives of faculty, staff and administrators continue uninterrupted. Apparently Covid is a threat only to the young who can easily be bullied into submission.<br />The move to online learning and other intrusive policies goes beyond what any state or federal health agency is recommending, let alone requiring. The Biden administration opposes school shutdowns. Yet universities still are cautioning that online learning may be extended.</td>

The argument then further asserts that, while each individual suffers a real cost of being inconvenienced, nearly everyone judges the benefits to be worth this cost.

      <td>The 2020 trade deal cements the power of ‘China, Inc.’</td>
      <td>“China Misses Target in 2020 Trade Deal” (U.S. News, Jan. 3) provides an informative account of how China failed to keep its side of the bargain of the 2020 U.S.-China trade deal to buy U.S. goods. Who is the buyer called “China”—private firms or the Chinese government? The Chinese government runs China like a giant corporation. The line between the state and private companies is fuzzy at best. The way the Chinese government treats companies such as Didi and Alibaba is more like managing departments of China, Inc.<br />Ironically, while we complain to the Chinese government that it interferes with the economy too much, the 2020 trade deal legitimized the interference by the Chinese government and strengthened its power.</td>

      <td>A teenager in rural Japan finds online fame through a virtual concert in Mamoru Hosoda’s latest animated feature</td>
      <td>When stardom hits in “Belle,” it does so with otherworldly force—a teenage singer’s debut concert draws a crowd of approximately 200 million. The venue really is otherworldly, though, a virtual-reality site called U, and the newly minted diva is an avatar named Belle, the glittering cyberspace projection of an unhappy high-schooler, Suzu, who lives her real-world life in a small rural town in Japan. This ambitious anime feature by Mamoru Hosoda juxtaposes the two worlds as Suzu makes her way through a troubled adolescence, and the story includes an elaborate riff on “Beauty and the Beast.” There’s too much plot for the film to manage, but its heart, and sumptuous art, are so firmly in the right place that its appeal comes through sweet and clear. (A GKIDS production, “Belle” is playing in theaters in a subtitled version, which I saw for review, and also in a dubbed version, which might be more accessible for young audiences.)<br />In Mr. Hosoda’s previous feature, the 2018 Oscar-nominated “Mirai,” the 4-year-old hero, Kun, is lonely because his baby sister has taken his place at the center of his family. Suzu’s sadness has deeper roots; she’s been inconsolable since her mother died years ago. Kun’s loneliness grows until he comes upon a magic garden where he encounters visitors from his family’s past and future alike. Suzu’s refuge is more contemporary, evoking the sort of metaverse alternatives to mere reality that Google, Apple, Oculus and who-knows-whatulus may be cooking up for our online future.</td>

The first part of its title could be taken as a response, or corrective, to what we hear so often in TV coverage of racist crimes—someone saying, ritually, “This is not who we are.” But the film’s content isn’t ritual at all. It’s one man’s answer, eloquent and heartfelt, to the challenge of reframing our discussion of a subject that has us numb from repetition.<br />The man at the center of the chronicle, Jeffery Robinson, is a former ACLU Deputy Legal Director. At the outset the camera finds him onstage in 2018 at New York’s Town Hall Theater, giving a presentation that combines calm instruction and passionate advocacy with a compelling kind of showmanship fueled by the impulse to show—to demonstrate, with the help of videos, photos and historical documents, how and why racism, as he puts it, “is our shared history.”</td>

Said Ms. Harris, who pulled together the interior design with a colleague, senior designer Kelley Roach, “They very much wanted a grown-up space, but they did not want it to be precious.”<br />Traces of the space’s former life as the floor of a factory building—wrapped beams, a concrete pillar, great, gridded windows—contribute a sophisticated hipness. To keep the aesthetic spare, Ms. Harris installed a tightly edited collection of contemporary furnishings in a limited, muted palette. To a basic scheme of black, white and gray, she added earthy tones of sandy brown and blush, and the occasional jolt of saturated color for a note of childlike playfulness and adult artiness.</td>

In 2019, Mr. Och paid roughly $93 million for the apartment plus approximately $2 million for a one-bedroom unit on a lower floor, The Wall Street Journal reported.

      <td>The government’s fight to control housing prices and insulate the economy is bound up with some very fundamental human impulses—and decisions made decades ago</td>
      <td>China is once again in the throes of a determined government attempt to rein in housing prices, boost domestic consumption and reduce dependence on the outside world. Why is this all so hard?<br />There are many answers, but some researchers are increasingly focusing on one intriguing piece of the puzzle: China has far too many young men relative to women, and that distorts its economy in subtle and powerful ways. The combination of China’s now-abandoned one-child policy, originally implemented in the 1980s, and a traditional preference for male children has pushed China’s sex ratio continually higher. In the late ’90s there were roughly equal numbers of men and women in their 20s, but by 2020 there were about 111 men for every 100 women, according to official data.</td>
