      <td>Since the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, tens of thousands of Afghans have worked alongside the U.S. military as interpreters, linguists and fixers. With the Taliban’s takeover of the country, that affiliation with the U.S. has placed a target on their backs—and they are desperate to flee the country.<br />Many of these Afghan allies likely qualify for a U.S. immigration program known as the Special Immigrant Visa, or SIV, which allows anyone who worked with the military for at least two years to come to the U.S. as a permanent resident.<br />The program has existed since 2009, and thousands of Afghans and their families have already relocated to the U.S. Many more are still awaiting their visas or recently received them, but are trapped in Afghanistan without a clear way to reach the airport in Kabul to board an evacuation flight.<br />Here’s an explainer on the program.<br />Q: What is the Special Immigrant Visa program and how does someone qualify?</td>

      <td>The chaotic Afghan withdrawal has shocked and angered U.S. allies.</td>
      <td>Remember when candidate Joe Biden said America “needs a leader the world respects”? Apparently President Biden forgot. Of the many consequences of his misbegotten Afghanistan withdrawal, one of the more serious is the way it has damaged America’s relationships with its allies, especially in Europe.<br />Afghanistan was an operation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and America’s NATO allies have invested significant blood and treasure in the conflict. That includes tens of thousands of troops over 20 years, more than 1,100 of whom were killed, and billions of dollars spent on the military operation and reconstruction effort.<br />This was a fulfillment of their obligations after the Sept. 11 terror attack led to the first invocation of the mutual self-defense clause in NATO’s founding treaty. European allies also have a stake in preventing a nation of nearly 40 million people from collapsing into a failed state that could trigger more mass migration to Europe, or become a new breeding ground for terrorism.<br />Yet everything about Mr. Biden’s Afghan withdrawal has been a slap to those allies. They didn’t want the U.S. to leave, but he did. The botched execution has left them scrambling to airlift out thousands of their citizens and thousands more Afghan translators and others who assisted each nation’s war effort.<br />And the snubs keep coming from Washington. In his Monday speech, Mr. Biden made only a glancing reference to NATO and none to America’s European allies in his account of the conflict. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson reportedly had to wait a day and a half after requesting a call with the President to get Mr. Biden on the phone.</td>

      <td>The President is coming up empty in his search to replace Afghan bases.</td>
      <td>The Journal news scoop Thursday that Vladimir Putin said nyet to President Biden’s request for the U.S. to conduct counterterrorism operations from a base in Central Asia is another strike against Mr. Biden’s ill-thought Afghanistan withdrawal. Having abandoned multiple bases in Afghanistan, including Bagram near Kabul and one in Kandahar, the U.S. is now left scrambling for the antiterror “over-the-horizon capabilities” that Mr. Biden has implied would be plentiful.<br />So far Mr. Biden has been shut out. The U.S. used bases in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan in the early years of the Afghan conflict, but those relationships ended as Russia and China pushed those countries not to cooperate with the U.S. Why did Mr. Biden think now would be different? A burst of Kremlin compassion?<br />Mr. Putin apparently thinks that sticking it to the U.S. is more important than the risks of new terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan. He may not want to upset the Taliban government that Russia is soon likely to recognize as the legitimate rulers in Kabul. Ditto for our friends in Beijing.<br />Without nearby bases, the U.S. will have to conduct operations against al Qaeda, ISIS and other jihadists from Qatar or U.S. ships in the Persian Gulf region. The long flights mean that 60% or more of a drone’s flight time will be taken up with the trip, rather than surveillance over Afghan territory. If ships have to be deployed for Afghan duty, they won’t be available for deterrence in East Asia. As Seth Jones notes nearby, Mr. Biden needs a new counterterror plan.</td>

      <td>The President picks a needless fight over state anti-mask mandates.</td>
      <td>Amid the chaos in Kabul, President Biden on Wednesday bravely rose to—pick a fight with Republican governors over masks. Yes, he really did.<br />Several GOP governors, including Florida’s Ron DeSantis and Texas’s Greg Abbott, have banned school districts from mandating masks. Mr. DeSantis has also threatened to dock the salaries of local school board officials and superintendents who mandate masks, though he has acknowledged he lacks the authority.<br />The science supporting masks in schools is thin, though many parents are worried about the Covid threat to their children as pediatric hospitalizations have climbed this summer as the Delta variant has spread. But many parents are also concerned about the potential harm from masks to the emotional development of their young children.<br />Polls show parents nationwide narrowly favor letting school districts require masks for unvaccinated children. School districts and parents in Texas and Florida are challenging their governor’s orders. They have a point that issues involving student safety and welfare are the responsibility of local school districts under state law, and in our view the governors should back off. Courts are likely to soon resolve the legal dispute in any case.<br />Which makes Mr. Biden’s intervention even more gratuitous. “Unfortunately, as we’ve seen throughout this pandemic, some politicians are trying to turn public safety measures—that is, children wearing masks in school—into political disputes for their own political gain,” Mr. Biden said, adding that “the intimidation and the threats we’re seeing across the country are wrong.”</td>

      <td>His careless withdrawal stranded thousands of U.S. citizens and an untold number of local allies.</td>
      <td>The ends of things matter as much as the beginnings. This end was unworthy of an epic struggle. It was not a departure but an abandonment. We left carelessly, with incompetence that can hardly be imagined. Could there have been less planning and foresight? That’s what will follow Joe Biden now, his carelessness and, when it broke as a world-wide story with the stampedes at the airport and people falling from planes, his stubbornness and pride.<br />It was weird from the beginning. The withdrawal plan always seemed abrupt and arbitrary. Why did the White House think the 20th anniversary of 9/11 was the right date for a pullout? What picture of America do they carry in their heads that told them that would be symbolically satisfying? It is as if they are governed by symbols with no understanding of what the symbols mean.<br />The president’s speech Monday was what everyone called it, defiant. What was needed was a distanced kindliness—patience, an acknowledgment of the mess that was unfolding, an explanation of a way through, a reiteration of the soundness of the larger vision. Instead, blame shifting, finger pointing, and defensive claims of higher wisdom. He “inherited a deal” from his predecessor. Sure, things “did unfold more quickly than we had anticipated,” but that only “reinforced” his conviction that he’d made “the right decision.” He’d told Afghanistan’s president to prepare for civil war, clean up corruption, unite politically. “They failed to do any of that.” There was no admission of mistakes or misjudgments. “I stand squarely by my decision. . . . We were clear-eyed about the risks. We planned for every contingency. . . . I’ve worked on these issues as long as anyone.” Unlike others he sees the big picture. “I will not repeat the mistakes we’ve made in the past.”<br />What America needed was wise and stoic Lincoln after First Bull Run. What we got was more late-season Junior Soprano telling Tony and the boys they don’t have the vision and guts anymore.<br />In the interview with George Stephanopoulos he was even worse—dug in, standing by carelessness and painting it as courage. When he means to project strength he very often appears high-handed and merely mulish.</td>

      <td>The chaos in Kabul will forever stain President Biden’s legacy, but he’s not the only one who is harming America’s reputation for constancy and honor. See the immigration restrictionists calling for the betrayal of U.S. allies in their moment of great need.<br />The Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program creates a path to permanent U.S. residency for locals who worked with the U.S. government in Afghanistan. After at least a year of service—and a vetting process that can take years—a qualified Afghan can bring his spouse and children to America if he is “experiencing an ongoing serious threat as a consequence of such employment.” Anyone who worked with the U.S. now faces such a threat from the Taliban if he remains in Afghanistan.<br />Americans who served alongside these Afghans know they were crucial to the U.S. mission. Without local guides to language and mores, more Americans would have died. Hundreds of translators and their family members have been killed for assisting the U.S., in addition to the 66,000 members of the Afghan military and police who have died in the war.<br />The priority of U.S. forces in Afghanistan should be to rescue and extract trapped Americans. But the U.S. also has a duty to thousands of Afghans who are in mortal danger. The Biden Administration is rightly attempting to evacuate SIV applicants, often to third countries where they will wait for a visa decision.<br />The SIV program has deep bipartisan support, but it’s not unanimous. Last month the U.S. House passed, 407-16, a bill to allocate an additional 8,000 visas for translators. The no votes came exclusively from Republicans.</td>

      <td>Afghanistan will surely provide a haven to an al Qaeda contingent—but the U.S. can still take action.</td>
      <td>One of the most sweeping foreign-policy failures in American history has unfolded before our eyes. The Taliban has expanded its reign of terror, marching through provincial capitals and swallowing Afghanistan. The sad reality is that the Taliban is running the show and will surely provide a haven to a growing al Qaeda contingent. There is still time to help those who helped us and to limit the Taliban’s influence in Afghanistan, but we must act now.<br />After ensuring all American citizens are evacuated, the U.S. government’s priority should be ensuring the safety of the Afghans who helped our men and women operate in Afghanistan for 20 years. We believe most of those eligible for the Special Immigrant Visa program live outside Kabul; this reality must be addressed. There are thousands more who don’t qualify for the SIV program but who helped develop Afghan civil society and are equally at risk. Many worked as journalists or for nongovernmental and other democracy-building organizations. These individuals are under the same threat from the Taliban and could be subject to assassination owing to their affiliation with the U.S. government.<br />It must be made clear to the Taliban that we are committed to helping those who sacrificed for us and will ensure their safe evacuation. We must establish safe corridors not only in Kabul but throughout the country to move those who cannot make it to the capital. The Biden administration has sent two brigades of American forces into Afghanistan to secure the airport. We must not rush the withdrawal of those forces as the president rushed the withdrawal of troops, leading to the current catastrophe.<br />We urge the administration to extend the evacuation beyond their original target date of Aug. 31. President Biden must keep forces in place long enough to evacuate those to whom we owe a great debt. He must be willing to accept the risk that the Taliban will attack our forces. We cannot afford another disorderly race to the exit while we still have a chance to do right by those who risked their lives and their families’ lives fighting our common enemies. We should be willing to apply the full force of the U.S. military to this cause. Anything less would be dishonorable.<br />The U.S. also should discourage other nations from recognizing the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. China and Iran, which border Afghanistan, have made clear they intend to work with the Taliban government. Recognition as the legitimate government of Afghanistan would give the Taliban access to economic aid and resources that won’t be used to improve the lives of normal Afghans. Instead, they will support those who wish to commit terrorism across the globe. This cannot happen. The Biden administration and our partner nations must be clear with China, Iran and other regional nations that recognition of the Taliban government will have severe consequences.</td>

The decisions made by the captain of that warship make the difference between life and death for your loved one and all sailors on board.<br />It matters how that captain and other commanders are selected. Do Americans want leaders who are promoted based on intelligence, aptitude, skill and excellence? Or do they want to entrust their children to those who were selected to bump up the military’s diversity statistics?<br />Earlier this month the Navy’s chief of personnel made a revealing remark that received little public attention. “I think we should consider reinstating photos in selection boards,” Vice Adm. John Nowell Jr. said at a conference. Officers up for promotion used to submit a photo as part of the review. A couple of years ago the services eliminated the photo requirement, aiming to remove any bias.<br />Adm. Nowell suggested the result wasn’t what the Navy hoped for. “We look at, for instance, the one-star board over the last five years, and we can show you where, as you look at diversity, it went down with photos removed.” In case that wasn’t clear, he continued: “We’re very clear with our language to boards that we want them to consider diversity across all areas. . . . I think having a clear picture just makes it easier.”<br />This statement undermines every minority officer who has risen through the ranks on his own merit. It says that people like me are useful to the Navy because we are black, not because we are highly trained professionals or because we met the uncompromising standards of leadership.</td>

But a simple truth has been apparent for years: We Westerners failed not for lack of effort, but because military and economic power alone cannot change the Islamic world in a lasting way.<br />The U.S.-led coalition arrived in South Asia 20 years ago seeking justice after 9/11. Soon we turned into apostles of universal civilization, the idea that human beings everywhere would make the same basic decisions we made in building political community. We set out to establish a liberal democratic state, not realizing that politics lies downstream of culture, and culture downstream of religion. It never occurred to us that America was what it was because of Christianity, and Afghanistan was what it was because of Islam.<br />The political scientist Samuel Huntington was right: Islamic societies belong to a distinctive civilization that resists the imposition of foreign values through power. We may believe that argument or not, but trillions of dollars, tens of thousands of lives, and two decades of warfare have not proved otherwise.<br />Still, many remain blind to the obvious. Facing seemingly unrelated chaos in places like Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian territories, Yemen, Libya and Nigeria, our diplomats and strategists devise one-off responses that ignore the common ideologies and actors that link them. Finding piles of broken china around the room, they diligently glue the pieces back together, not seeing the elephant nearby whose feet are covered in ceramic dust.<br />This blindness is driven by a noble desire to see humans as equal, interchangeable beings for whom faith and culture are accidents of birth. But these accidents are non-negotiable truths for hundreds of millions of people who would rather die than concede them. Failure to comprehend this is a symptom of spiritual emptiness: Alienated from America’s Christian origins, millions cannot fathom how faith could play a vital role in binding humans together.</td>

We complete it together over a hilly course each Saturday morning throughout July.<br />The challenges vary weekly, but not from year to year. That way we can see where we’ve improved and, more often, where we still need improvement. There’s one catch: Each workout must be completed in under an hour. It’s doable, but far from easy.<br />A banquet is held in August to honor the fortunate, fleet-footed few among us who posted qualifying times for each workout. T-shirts are designed and awarded—our version of the Masters Green Jacket—to these garlanded guests, who wear them proudly throughout the year.<br />It’s the distance-running FTC segments I least enjoy. They give me time to think, though, if only to forget the burning in my lungs. Here’s what occurred to me one Saturday: “Don’t give in to peer pressure”—that bankable adage I grew up believing—is wrong, or at least incomplete. The lesson should be: If bad peers are applying untoward pressure, find better peers. They’re out there.<br />This struck me as I saw Jed, a larger man than I, fly past me on a grueling uphill run. Departing alongside him was self-delusion that guys like me, nobody’s bantamweight, can’t run with the swift. I can find a higher gear if I follow Jed’s example and dig a little deeper.</td>

      <td>The intricate craft of a work of high fashion echoes the skill that once mended fishing nets—and the beauty of a handmade world.</td>
      <td>In 2016 Yves Saint Laurent’s famous “sardine dress” went on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was a simple sheath, writes Alison Hawthorne Deming, “made to hug the contours of the body so that a woman might look as sleek and bioluminescent as a fish.” The silvery overlapping scales were made from opalescent sequins, and the colors were so subtle that they bled into one shimmer “like the disappearing light a herring casts as it darts through the water.” Ms. Deming was immediately reminded of the herring harvests in Grand Manan Island, a fishing community on the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, where she’s spent many summers since she was a child.<br />“A Woven World” threads the story of two seemingly disparate artisan crafts—herring fishing and haute couture—into an elegiac history and memoir. Ms. Deming is a poet (“Stairway to Heaven,” 2016) and the author of several books of nonfiction (“Zoologies: On Animals and the Human Spirit,” 2014). Her project was inspired by W.S. Merwin’s “Lament for the Makers,” a memorial to the poets who had influenced him. She too “wanted to participate emotionally with the past before it slipped away.”<br />Ms. Deming grew up in Connecticut; her father worked in media and theater, and her mother directed and wrote for the stage. Her maternal ancestors were French dressmakers, and she makes a connection between their painstaking labor of couture and the work of fishermen: dignity of craft. Her book is also a sobering look at how small-scale artisans have been made obsolete by mass production.<br />Grand Manan Island fishermen mended their nets by hand, a technique handed down through the generations. She is struck by the craftsmanship of weirs they built, “layer upon layer of skill and learning, discernment and cross-cultural conversation, a process lost to history and evident only in the graceful heart-shaped twined structures that give definition to the island’s coastal waters.” She visits Iceland, herring central, where she’s fascinated by the sight of farmhouses nestled at the base of looming volcanic cliffs. “The scale is unsettling, human habitations like little Monopoly houses on the game board of tectonic unrest.” During her weeklong visit 500 earthquakes shake the country. “No big deal for the locals.”<br />In Paris, she searches for traces of her great-grandmother, Louisa de St. Isle Bregny. Relations between mothers and daughters over two generations were cold. Ms. Deming didn’t like her mother very much, and her mother didn’t like hers, Marie. Nevertheless, Marie lived with her daughter’s family from 1945 until her death in 1971. In her room she kept a dress-form mannequin and sewed without patterns, a skill learned from her mother, Louisa, who emigrated from Paris to New York City around 1870 and ran a dressmaking business until the Depression. In France Louisa had been a couturier for the formidable wife of Napoleon III, Empress Eugénie, champion of gigantic steel-cage crinolines said to have been inspired by the dome of St. Paul’s Cathedral.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—A man surrendered to law enforcement Thursday, about five hours after he drove a black pickup truck onto a sidewalk next to the Library of Congress and told police he had a bomb.<br />The scare drew a massive law enforcement response and prompted the evacuations of nearby offices and homes in the heart of the nation’s capital still on edge after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.<br />Police spent hours negotiating with the man, who pulled up to the building at about 9:15 a.m., holding what an officer believed to be a detonator, U.S. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger said. Investigators combed the vehicle and found what police described as possible bomb-making materials, but no explosives. Police also found a propane tank in the bed of the pickup that officers determined was safe, Chief Manger said.<br />The man communicated with officers by holding up hand-written signs through his front driver’s side window, police said. He got out of the pickup and surrendered shortly after officers used a robot to hand him a phone to try to speak with him, which he didn’t use, the chief said.<br />Chief Manger identified the man as Floyd Ray Roseberry of Grover, N.C. He said police were still investigating his motives, noting that he had no serious criminal history out of North Carolina and that his mother had recently died.</td>

Later this month, the Boy Scouts are expected to seek approval of chapter 11 plan disclosures that would give creditors enough information to vote yes or no. The bankruptcy plan also requires approval from the judge, who said Thursday she wasn’t determining whether it would pass legal muster.<br />But the judge said she wouldn’t approve certain aspects of the restructuring agreement, such as nullifying an earlier $650 million settlement between the Boy Scouts and insurer Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. The youth group’s obligations, if any, to Hartford must be decided separately, she said.<br />Nor will she let the Boy Scouts cover millions of dollars in legal fees for lawyers that negotiated in the bankruptcy on behalf of abuse victims, she said.</td>

      <td>In this sci-fi thriller, the actor stars alongside Rebecca Ferguson as a private eye who uses futuristic tech to help his clients regain lost memories</td>
      <td>‘Reminiscence” is a futurist thriller about memory and memory addiction. What you may remember best after seeing it, in theaters or on HBO Max, is its bleak but majestic vision of Miami at a time when rising sea levels have engulfed much of the city, which manages to carry on against all odds and logic—Venice at the intersection of “Blade Runner,” a mostly sodden megalopolis where a few dry enclaves protected by gigantic seawalls are the exclusive province of the rich. This debut feature by Lisa Joy, the co-creator of TV’s “Westworld,” has been framed as a film noir, though with a difference. Almost every sequence contains references to other films. Spotting them is a pleasant distraction from figuring out the plot, an absurdly rococo structure that rivals the most flagrant befuddlements of “Inception” or, for that matter, the latter stretches of “Westworld.”<br />Hugh Jackman plays Nick Bannister, a hard-living, softhearted private eye. Nick helps his clients regain lost memories by fitting them with headgear reminiscent of “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind” and immersing them in his reminiscence tank, a piece of equipment evoking “Minority Report” or, in its dilapidation, the steampunk technology of “Brazil.”<br />Rebecca Ferguson is Mae, the femme fatale of the piece. In “The Maltese Falcon,” the pioneering noir classic from eight decades ago, Mary Astor showed up in Sam Spade’s office supposedly looking for her missing sister. Mae comes to Nick’s dingy laboratory for help finding lost keys. After capturing his heart in an instant, she vanishes just as suddenl yas she appeared. That’s the mystery element of the narrative: his frantic search for her through other people’s memories. Nick’s tough-minded assistant, Watts (Thandiwe Newton), dismisses Mae, with more than a tinge of jealousy, as “an idea wrapped in a tight dress,” but she’s the movie’s best idea. The camera adores her, for good reason—Paul Cameron did the elegant cinematography. Like all femmes fatales, Mae is not what she seems, and Ms. Ferguson bestows steady-state warmth and a lyrical spirit on her character’s many incarnations, one of them being a nightclub chanteuse who sings “Where or When” in a style faintly redolent of Marlene Dietrich.<br />Mr. Jackman provides a strong presence too, and a versatile one. Injecting his clients with a sedative before setting them afloat in the tank, Nick calms them further with the dulcet susurrations of a professional hypnotist. An ardent fan of the memories he retrieves, he watches holographic excerpts of them play out on a circular stage adjacent to his equipment, sometimes standing next to the action like the Stage Manager in “Our Town.” (Not a movie reference, just a passing thought.)<br />Nick is also a veteran of a recent civil war, so his combat chops serve him well—Wolverine without retractable claws—when the search for Mae turns furiously violent. The baddest of the bad guys, a dirty ex-cop named Boothe, is played by the unquenchable Cliff Curtis with a Marlon Brando accent. In case there’s any doubt about the accent’s provenance, there’s a scene involving Boothe and a pigeon who must have flown Terry Malloy’s rooftop coop in “On the Waterfront.” And Tamara, a delusional woman of a certain age played by Marina de Tavira, could pass for Blanche in “A Streetcar Named Desire.”</td>

      <td>The new series, starring Sandra Oh as the first female chair of an English department at a university, is an engaging sendup of higher education.</td>
      <td>That there are problems of the most serious kind at Pembroke University, not least the financial kind, is clear from the start. There’s ominous muttering from the administration about faculty members who’ve been around for 25 years or so giving the same lecture. “Just give me three names,” pleads one dean looking for jobs to cut.<br />One of the great strengths of “The Chair” (Netflix) is its vivid evocation of the requirements for survival in this place where a packed lecture hall and a youthful instructor count for more than teaching ability. There’s a strong hint of the magic that might cause the dream of a crowded class to come true when a student races into a room to ask if this is where Sex and the Novel is going to be taught. No, the professor (Bob Balaban) darkly informs him, it’s the Survey of American Letters From 1850 to 1918.<br />It’s a measure of the script’s intelligence that there are no heavy judgments handed down here on the student’s choice. More impressive still is the portrait of a culture of bottomless sensitivity—now, to be sure, no longer confined to campuses—and the fever swamps to which it can lead.<br />It’s a bleak picture. Still, “The Chair” is full of charm, and a captivating humor, a kind evident during a faculty party. It may not be the best of times for celebration, but celebrate the faculty does anyway in the midst of job worries and ominous administrative directives like the one that requires longtime Chaucer scholar Joan Hambling (a wonderfully regal Holland Taylor) to be moved to a darkish basement office, part of the dean’s bullying strategy to encourage retirements. Prof. Hambling isn’t inclined to take this unsubtle hint of her reduced status lightly. She’s one of the faculty members whose age and long employment at Pembroke make her a prime candidate for one of the job cuts the administration yearns for. The celebration in question is in honor of the appointment of the first female chair of the English Department. She’s the Korean-American professor Ji-Yoon Kim (Sandra Oh).<br />Though the instructors have little to say about the adventure of teaching English literature at Pembroke, the writers of “The Chair” leave little doubt about the prime concerns of the students. For instance, as regards Herman Melville—wasn’t he a wife-beater? And there was the story some had heard that women had done some of the writing of Melville’s great works. The young scholars leave class for the day with their teacher’s assurance that they will take this question up next time.</td>

      <td>Sean Penn directs and stars in this episodic story of a daughter’s fraught relationship with her swindler father.</td>
      <td>Instead of skeletons in the closet, “Flag Day,” playing in theaters, gives us skeletal members of a dysfunctional family. It’s clear what the film means to be—a bittersweet portrait of a daughter’s love for her incorrigible father. But the characters don’t add up. The complexities and nuances that might have brought them fully to life never made it to the screen. What’s there is a repetitive tale spanning decades in which the daughter shuttles back and forth between two incompetent parents until her father is revealed to be a world-class counterfeiter on the run and she emerges, just as abruptly, as an investigative journalist.<br />The director was Sean Penn, who made the film a family affair by playing the father, John Vogel, and by casting his real-life daughter, Dylan Penn, to play John’s daughter, Jennifer Vogel. The acting is excellent throughout—no surprise when it comes to Mr. Penn, and maybe not such a great one about Ms. Penn, the trajectory of apples falling from trees being what it is. (Katheryn Winnick is Jennifer’s mother, Patty.)<br />But the screenplay, adapted from Ms. Vogel’s book “Flim-Flam Man: The True Story of My Father’s Counterfeit Life,” presents a bad surprise verging on a mystery. The brothers who did the adaptation know their dramatic principles. Jez Butterworth wrote “The Ferryman,” a play of special brilliance; he and John-Henry Butterworth were two of the three screenwriters who helped make “Ford v Ferrari” such exemplary entertainment. In “Flag Day,” though, they chose, or were asked, to spin a long series of vignettes into a wobbly narrative with zigzags instead of an arc, and to accompany many of them with Jennifer’s voice-over recollections and explanations, a poor substitute for drama and conflict. As a result, the film doesn’t feel like a true story so much as a reprocessed account of a generic con man with variable charms. (The title comes from John having been born on Flag Day, a factoid celebrated in a semisurreal parade sequence that recalls the opening of “Blue Velvet.”)<br />The film works best in nostalgic flashes like the one when Jennifer, played from age 11 to 13 by Jadyn Rylee, learns to drive while sitting on her father’s lap at the wheel of his car during the summer of 1975. Still, questions arise, and answers aren’t forthcoming. Why does Jennifer’s brother, Nick, play such a vanishingly small, nearly silent role? When did her father become an arsonist? When, how and where did he acquire the skills required to produce counterfeit bills of surpassing quality? Why does he sound like a self-delusional revenant from the 1930s when he tells his exasperated daughter that “My skill is opportunities,” or “I gotta keep the plates spinnin’, I gotta keep the balls in the air”? For all its period detail and visual grace—Danny Moder did the cinematography—“Flag Day” falls afoul of counterfeit feelings.<br />Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgenstern@wsj.com</td>

The platform, owned by closely held London-based Fenix International Ltd., said the changes are to comply with the requests of banking partners and payment processors.<br />OnlyFans has in recent months been looking to raise money, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Bloomberg earlier reported the news.<br />OnlyFans founder Tim Stokely created the website in 2016 as a paid social-media site for adults with more liberal content policies than the traditional platforms like  Facebook  and Instagram. While the site is best known for its porn stars, its recent growth is due in part to the company’s efforts to diversify its content, Mr. Stokely said at The Wall Street Journal’s Future of Everything Festival in May. During the past year, OnlyFans has attracted more creators who focus on fitness, food and fashion.</td>

      <td>Journalist Alec Wilkinson adapts his New Yorker piece ‘The Confession’ into a laudable, tense two-hander.</td>
      <td>Pittsfield, Mass.<br />Playwriting is a pursuit rarely taken up in middle age, at least not with success. Most of its best-known practitioners start young, immerse themselves in the world of theater and learn what Alan Ayckbourn calls “the crafty art of playmaking,” in which technique is at least as important as inspiration. It takes time, bone-snappingly hard work and, more often than not, a few false starts. Scarcely any established novelists or poets have pulled off the trick of writing a play that is effective onstage. (Ever read John Updike’s “Buchanan Dying”? Don’t.) So it is with considerable surprise that I report that Alec Wilkinson, who was born in 1952 and has been publishing superior journalism in the New Yorker throughout the past four decades, just wrote his first play and managed to get it produced—and that it’s damned good.<br />“Sister Sorry” is a fictionalized version of “The Confession,” one of Mr. Wilkinson’s New Yorker pieces. Published in 1993, it told the story of Allan Bridge, a conceptual artist who got the idea to start what came to be known as “the Apology Line,” a phone number at which people could leave anonymous recorded confessions and (in Mr. Bridge’s words) “apologize for their wrongs against people without jeopardizing themselves.” In addition, they could listen and respond to other people’s messages, and some of them threatened Mr. Bridge, who billed himself as “Mr. Apology” and whose “art” consisted of playing these messages at museums.<br />Most of “The Confession” is devoted to a young man who called himself “Jumpin’ Jim” and confessed—or so he said—to having murdered his mother, with whom he lived and whom he found hateful, by smothering her with a pillow. It was not Mr. Apology’s custom to return confessors’ calls, but Jim called repeatedly and in due course persuaded Mr. Apology to meet him at a bar. A few days later Mr. Apology called Jim, whose phone was answered by . . . Jim’s mother.<br />The print version of “The Confession,” in which Mr. Wilkinson told as much of the story of Jim and Mr. Apology (who was killed—not by Jim—in a 1995 hit-and-run skiing accident) as he could confirm, is presented straightforwardly, almost baldly, leaving it up to the reader to decide what motivated Jim. It later appeared in a collection of Mr. Wilkinson’s work called “Mr. Apology and Other Essays” and remains to this day one of his best-remembered pieces. Then he decided that it might make a good play and turned the real-life characters into a young man called Jack Flash and a woman artist who goes by the name of Sister Sorry. The result is a terse, magnetically engrossing two-hander (it runs for some 75 intermission-free minutes) that received its world premiere this week at Massachusetts’ Barrington Stage Company, tautly directed by Joe Calarco and performed by Jennifer Van Dyck and Christopher Sears.</td>

      <td>E-commerce giant needs showrooms for its growing line of private labels—and other retailers are unlikely to help</td>
      <td>Amazon . com’s plan to open its own department stores might not be as crazy as it sounds.<br />Much depends on the details. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the e-commerce titan plans to open several large physical retail locations that will carry clothing, household items, electronics and other products.<br />The stores will be smaller than typical department stores at around 30,000 square feet, but much larger than the company’s previous attempts at its own retail outlets. Its Go convenience stores typically have ranged between 450 square feet and 2,300 square feet, though a grocery store the company opened last year in Seattle was just over the 10,000 square foot mark.<br />Other Amazon stores specializing in books and kitchen gadgets have averaged around 4,000 square feet. Still, physical stores make up just 4% of Amazon’s annual revenue, mostly from its ownership of the Whole Foods grocery chain.<br />The company might understandably shy away from the department store label, which hasn’t been a popular format lately. Competition not only with Amazon but other so-called big-box retailers has hit the sector hard, and closures from the pandemic certainly didn’t help. The four largest U.S. department store operators by annual sales— Kohl’s ,  Nordstrom, Dillards and  Macy’s —have seen their revenue fall by an average of 6% annually over the last five years, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Amazon has averaged annual revenue growth of 29% in that time.</td>

That challenge has deepened with the collapse over the weekend of the Afghan government and armed forces.<br />The exchange also indicates that Moscow is more determined to try to maintain Central Asia as a sphere of influence than to expand cooperation with a new American president over the turmoil in Afghanistan, former and current U.S. officials said.<br />“The Russians have no interest in having the U.S. back in there,” said Paul Goble, a former State Department expert on Eurasia.<br />The U.S. requirement for what the Pentagon calls an “over-the-horizon” counterterrorism capability in Afghanistan has grown substantially in recent days with the Taliban takeover.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Federal Trade Commission filed a new version of its antitrust lawsuit against  Facebook Inc.  on Thursday, seeking to jump-start its case with bolstered allegations that the company is abusing a monopoly position in social media.<br />The FTC voted 3-2 along party lines to file the amended lawsuit, with Chairwoman Lina Khan participating in the agency’s deliberations and supporting the new complaint. The commission denied Facebook’s request that Ms. Khan, a Democrat, be recused because of her past criticism of big tech companies.<br />The FTC’s amended complaint comes after a federal judge in June dismissed the agency’s original lawsuit, saying it didn’t make sufficient allegations to support claims that Facebook engaged in unlawful monopolization.<br />With its new, 80-page lawsuit, the FTC seeks to tell a longer, more detailed story about why it believes Facebook is a dominant force that uses its power to hobble any rival that might threaten its market position.<br />The FTC’s core allegations remain the same as its original complaint from December: that Facebook unlawfully sought to suppress competition by buying up potential rivals such as the messaging platform WhatsApp and image-sharing app Instagram. The commission is seeking to unwind those deals.</td>

The company confirmed on Aug. 16 that it was hacked, adding the following day that attackers made off with personal data from nearly 48 million people. Those victims include 7.8 million current postpaid customers, T-Mobile said, and about 40 million former and prospective customers who applied for plans.<br />While U.S. officials have warned of an uptick in ransomware attacks in recent months, T-Mobile’s hackers didn’t lock up the company’s systems and demand payment. Instead, attackers broke into the company’s servers through an open access point, stole data and have since tried to sell different sets of the information online for between $80,000 and $270,000 worth of bitcoin.<br />The attack is the latest and most severe in a string of cybersecurity incidents at the company, said Allie Mellen, a cybersecurity analyst at research firm Forrester Inc.</td>

      <td>No need for peeling or coring—or canning, for that matter. These simple, delicious recipes for homemade ketchup, salsa and marinara sauce will stock your kitchen with peak-season tomatoes for the months to come.</td>
      <td>EACH MONDAY, from late July through September, I preserve tomatoes. In the thick of the season, I go through about 400 pounds a week. I boil them down into ketchup, and marinara sauce, and salsa, and tomato purée, and Bloody Mary mix. I put all these in jars, which I seal with a pressure canner to then sell at farmers’ markets throughout the year. I’ve been preserving tomatoes every Monday, this time of year, since I met the farmer who is now my wife.<br />Back when we were first dating, I must have noticed a crate of slightly overripe tomatoes at her farm, slated for the compost pile. It would have been a Monday, since that’s the day she and her crew sort through the tomatoes that won’t make it to the next weekend’s market. I must have asked if I could have them to preserve. I’m sure I said something witty like, “The best tomato you’ll ever eat will be rotten tomorrow.” She must have rolled her eyes and said, “Have at it.”<br />That first year, I plunged the tomatoes, all 50 pounds of them, into boiling water, then slipped off their skins and removed their stem ends before dicing them and boiling them with onion and garlic into marinara sauce. How quaint. The next year, my payload was up to about 200 pounds a week, and it’s been increasing ever since. Out of necessity, I’ve learned a few shortcuts<br />My biggest lesson came the summer I was 1,200 pounds behind in my processing and needed to contract outside help. The Bauman family runs a small-scale processing plant on the edge of Amish country in Pennsylvania, near where I live. They are famous for their apple butter, but a large part of their business model is processing tomatoes for local farms. You can drop off your vegetables and, a few days later, pick up sealed jars of ketchup, or salsa, or any number of preserved products. Jars cost a few dollars each; farmers then sell them at local markets. That’s why most small-farm ketchup in eastern Pennsylvania tastes the same: It’s all Bauman’s recipe.<br />I’m pretty particular about recipes; most of my business model is writing them. It took some convincing to get Bauman’s to follow my recipe for salsa that year. In the end, and due in no small part to the size of the order, they conceded.</td>

      <td>The South is the nation’s most Republican region. Will it stay that way? In the South and elsewhere, big metro areas, trending Democratic, are the key.</td>
      <td>For years, academics and journalists writing about politics in the South have paid homage to V.O. Key’s “Southern Politics in State and Nation” (1949). For good reason: Key was an arresting writer, capable of fashioning a political scientist’s generalizations and writing fascinating accounts of the quirks of local politicians. With a slide rule and long division, he calculated thousands of state and county voting percentages and displayed them on maps that clarified the mystery of why some candidates won and some lost the usually decisive Democratic primaries in the 1930s and 1940s.<br />Key saw the dominant factor in Southern politics as the determination of white voters and politicians to maintain blacks in subordinate legal status in the five states that, according to the 1930 and 1940 censuses, had populations 35% to 50% percent black. (Since then black percentages have fallen, and only Mississippi, with 38% black, falls into this category.) Key’s book, like the psychologist John Dollard’s “Caste and Class in a Southern Town” (1938), told non-Southern Americans the secrets of life and politics in a region most of them considered a faraway country of which they knew little.<br />In “Movers and Stayers: The Partisan Transformation of 21st Century Southern Politics,” Irwin Morris notes that “the characteristic region of the South—the Deep South—is no longer the distinctive, dominant force in Southern politics it once was.” The one-party character that Key emphasized—overemphasized, in my view, overlooking the pre-New Deal years—almost immediately changed in postwar presidential politics. In 1952, 1956 and 1960, Dwight Eisenhower (in two elections) and Richard Nixon won 49%, 50% and 48% of the popular vote in the South—defined as the 11 Confederate states plus West Virginia, Kentucky and Oklahoma—and carried multiple Southern states. Since then, Republicans have won more votes than Democrats in the South in 12 of 15 presidential elections.<br />Republican advances in down-ballot races took longer. It wasn’t until 1990 that the GOP’s congressional candidates in the South won a higher percentage of popular votes than Republicans elsewhere, and Republicans didn’t dominate Southern legislatures until the mid-2000s. By now Southerners, like Americans elsewhere, are mostly straight-ticket voters, and the South is the nation’s most Republican region.<br />Mr. Morris, a political scientist at North Carolina State, argues that the South “is in the process of becoming more Democratic again.” The prime reason, he says, is that “movers”—people moving into fast-growing Southern counties, coming from outside a state or moving within it—are mostly Democrats, not Republicans, as they were in Key’s time and up through the 1990s. Mr. Morris adds that these “movers” influence “stayers” to vote more Democratic as well, though he admits that such indirect effects “are contextually dependent” and thus not statistically predictable.</td>

      <td>With Jaguar aiming to go all-electric by 2025, the F-Pace SVR might be one of its last petrol-powered models. Dan Neil test-drives the cat and lets it roar.</td>
      <td>IN FEBRUARY, Jaguar Land Rover—based in Gaydon, Warwickshire, and owned by the Tata Group of Mumbai—announced that the Leaping Cat was to be “reimagined” as an “all-electric luxury brand from 2025.”<br />Whatever that means. In the months since, JLR has declined to provide details. But if realized in full, such a plan would carry Jaguar over the all-electric threshold years earlier than rivals including BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi. Uniquely, JLR’s announcement seems to imply some sort of hard stop on petrol-powered Jaguars (about 426,000 global sales in 2020). Other automakers—Daimler and Toyota among them—want to ease the pain of electrification with a generation of gas-electric hybrids and plug-in hybrid models.<br />While other brands are circling the block to get where they are going, Jaguar wants to execute a bootleg turn.<br />Cool. Jaguar is a durable luxury brand with a legacy of performance and design. JLR’s commitment to manufacturing in the U.K. will secure the continued goodwill of the national government. The plan takes seriously, as it should, the U.K.’s and EU’s proposed timelines for a tailpipe-emissions ban by 2035.<br />The electric reset of Jaguar would also avoid years of unsatisfying compromises required to meet standards already on the horizon—cars and trucks relying on ever-smaller gas-hybrid and fiddly PHEV powertrains, eco-saving and stop/starting consumers to the brink of madness. Better to rip off the Band-Aid and go all-electric.</td>

The FAA has pledged to take a more aggressive approach to pursuing punishments for passengers who flout safety rules.<br />The agency can’t bring criminal cases against passengers who act out, but it now has brought more than $1 million in civil penalties against passengers who allegedly do. So far this year, the agency has received about 3,900 reports of such behavior, including 2,900 reports of passengers refusing to comply with a federal mask mandate that has been extended through mid-January 2022.<br />Some of the passengers with fines levied against them physically assaulted, threatened, or yelled obscenities at flight attendants or other passengers. Many refused to abide by mask requirements or didn’t follow alcohol rules on board, or both. The individual fines ranged from $45,000 to $7,500.<br />Some 85% of flight attendants say they have dealt with unruly passengers this year, according to a recent survey of close to 5,000 flight attendants across 30 airlines by the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA union. Flight attendants say physical altercations, harassment and threats often stem from pushback to mask mandates, alcohol or flight delays and cancellations, the union survey found. More than half of those surveyed said they have dealt with more than five such incidents so far this year, and 17% said the incidents involved physical altercations.</td>

      <td>Understated and easy to clean, black nylon bags—like the iconic styles Prada popularized decades ago—are trending once more. Here, four updated options to try.</td>
      <td>WHEN MIUCCIA PRADA took over her family’s leather goods company in the 1970s, no one expected that she’d play by the rules—after all, she was a member of the Italian Communist Party. Now known for her cerebral explorations of femininity and for making “ugly” cool, Ms. Prada heretically found early success in handbags that didn’t rely on exotic skins or flashy hardware, but on nylon—a material used for toothbrush bristles, ladies’ stockings, and WWII soldiers’ parachutes.<br />Though first introduced in the ’80s, Prada’s black nylon bags really took off in the ’90s, in various styles from backpacks to mini baguettes. Among the factors that fueled their popularity: the rise of anti-fashion-as-fashion, minimalism and futuristic aesthetics spurred by the impending turn-of-the-millennium. Around the same time, Kate Spade’s more affordable nylon box bags became ubiquitous among teens and adults. Imitations ensued and nylon bags soon populated every store at the mall.<br />Lately, fashion’s cyclical nature has been busily resurrecting ’90s trends—nylon bags included. On photo shoots, Los Angeles stylist Rebecca Ramsey has observed that “younger models and talent show up with pre-loved nylon purchases from Depop or even their mom’s old bags.” But faddish nostalgia isn’t the only driver: Nylon bags are often practical, waterproof, virtually indestructible and—perhaps most appealing in the midst of a global pandemic—easy to wipe off. Brands like LeSportsac (which makes a roomy crossbody) and Sacai (which sells a tiny utilitarian version) are offering updated takes on the classic. The slouchy interpretation from New York label the Row, functional enough for day but sleek enough for night, has generated a particular abundance of buzz. If your heart is still set on the bag that started it all, fear not: Prada has reissued its early 2000s Mini Bag, now rendered in nylon made from recycled ocean trash.<br />Ms. Ramsey has relied on a nylon Prada fanny pack since the pandemic hit. Wary of germs, she’s found the hands-free, simple-to-clean bag an ideal companion for stroller walks and travel. Similarly, a vintage Kate Spade backpack has become an indispensable and liberating staple for Roxanne Fequiere, 33. “It’s one of the most versatile bags I own,” said the New York writer. “I don’t flinch when it rains because I know whatever’s inside is protected. I don’t feel precious about the bag itself.”<br />The Wall Street Journal is not compensated by retailers listed in its articles as outlets for products.

      <td>WASHINGTON—Democrats are set to gain control over the nation’s derivatives-market regulator after one of the two Republicans on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission departs at the end of this month.<br />CFTC Commissioner Brian Quintenz, who was nominated in 2017 by then-President Donald Trump at the recommendation of Sen. Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.), said in an interview he plans to leave the agency Aug. 31. Though his five-year term expired in April 2020, he is legally eligible to remain at the regulator until the end of this year.<br />The departure will leave the CFTC’s five-member panel—which already had one vacancy following the exit of former Chairman Heath Tarbert in January—with two empty seats. It also could allow acting Chairman Rostin Behnam more leeway over policy by giving Democrats a majority on the commission.<br />Bloomberg reported last week that President Biden plans to nominate Mr. Behnam to lead the CFTC on a permanent basis. The White House declined to comment on the report and said it had no updates on whom Mr. Biden plans to nominate to fill the existing vacancy at the CFTC.<br />The agency, which oversees the markets for hundreds of trillions of dollars of derivatives, has focused mainly on enforcement since Mr. Biden took office. Among its few policy-related actions was Mr. Behnam’s creation in March of a unit to focus on “the role of derivatives in understanding, pricing and addressing climate-related risk and transitioning to a low-carbon economy.”</td>

      <td>Former President Donald Trump’s company and its finance chief were criminally indicted this summer</td>
      <td>Manhattan prosecutors are moving to advance their criminal investigation into former President Donald Trump’s business affairs, fighting with his company over evidence and continuing talks with the lawyer of a Trump Organization executive who hasn’t been charged, said people familiar with the matter.<br />Manhattan prosecutors and Trump Organization lawyers appeared at a secret court proceeding with New York State Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan last week to discuss a dispute over documents the Manhattan district attorney’s office has subpoenaed, the people said. Justice Merchan is overseeing the criminal case stemming from the indictment of the Trump Organization and its finance chief, Allen Weisselberg, made public in July.<br />The dispute is related to documents prosecutors have sought for their continuing investigation, the people said. While the scope of the evidence in question couldn’t be determined, it includes a broad swath of financial documents, according to the people.<br />In another sign of movement in the criminal probe, prosecutors have been holding talks with a lawyer for Trump Organization executive Matthew Calamari Sr., partly to determine whether his cooperation would be helpful, according to people familiar with the matter. The next public court appearance for the Trump Organization and Mr. Weisselberg is Sept. 20, court records show.<br />Last month, the Manhattan district attorney’s office announced indictments charging the Trump Organization and Mr. Weisselberg with tax fraud. Prosecutors accused Mr. Weisselberg and the company of a 15-year-long tax-fraud scheme involving off-the-books payments and perks like cars and apartments to employees at the company. Prosecutors from the New York attorney general’s office are working with the district attorney’s office on the case.</td>

      <td>He acknowledges the national interest, but his administration has failed to develop a strategy.</td>
      <td>President Biden said Monday that “our only vital national interest in Afghanistan remains today what it has always been: preventing a terrorist attack on [the] American homeland.” Yet one of the administration’s most egregious failures has been neglecting to develop a clear strategy to target terrorists in the country. With more than 10,000 foreign fighters already there, from groups like al Qaeda and Islamic State, the administration quickly needs an armed surveillance strategy that involves using intelligence and air power to target terrorists.<br />U.S. and other Western intelligence agencies have long known the Taliban continue to have close ties to al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. In a June 2021 assessment, the United Nations Security Council concluded that a “large number of al Qaeda fighters and other foreign extremist elements aligned with the Taliban are located in various parts of Afghanistan.” The Taliban this week released thousands of them from prisons in Bagram, Kabul, Kandahar and elsewhere.<br />The Taliban and al Qaeda enjoy longstanding personal relationships, intermarriage, a shared history of struggle and sympathetic ideologies. Al Qaeda leaders have pledged loyalty to every Taliban leader since the group’s establishment. It is shocking, then, that U.S. officials have brushed off the implications of a Taliban victory, even as intelligence analysts said that a Taliban victory would likely be a boon for jihadists.<br />The Taliban has well-established ties with other regional and international terrorist groups, such as the Pakistan-based Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba. In addition, there are roughly 2,000 Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan, and the group has conducted mass-casualty attacks across the country.<br />The Taliban victory presents a remarkable opportunity for these groups to reorganize and threaten the U.S. at home and abroad. Jihadist groups gleefully celebrated the Taliban’s conquest of Kabul on chat rooms and other online platforms, pledging the revitalization of a global jihad. We have seen this before. The Soviet defeat in Afghanistan in the late 1980s spawned al Qaeda.</td>

      <td>Macy’s Inc.,   Kohl’s Corp.  and Coach parent  Tapestry Inc.  reported big quarterly sales gains on Thursday, but it is unclear how long the shopping spree will last in the face of new pandemic restrictions to counteract rising coronavirus cases.<br />Macy’s sales at stores open at least a year jumped 62% in the three months to July 31, compared with a year ago. Same-store sales also grew slightly compared with the same period in 2019. Net sales of $5.65 billion exceeded both 2020 and 2019 levels.<br />“We’ve come through what I hope is the worst of the pandemic,” Macy’s CEO Jeff Gennette said on a conference call. In an interview, he said that he hasn’t seen any evidence yet of slowing sales due to the virus surge, noting that back-to-school sales have been strong as have sales of work clothes and for social occasions. He said the bigger concerns were supply-chain problems and labor shortages.<br />Sales at Kohl’s and Tapestry also returned to pre-pandemic levels. Both companies reported sales and earnings that beat analyst expectations and Kohl’s, like Macy’s, raised its guidance for the full year.<br />Macy’s shares rose more than 15% in morning trading after nearly tripling over the past year through Wednesday’s close. Kohl’s shares jumped more than 8%, but Tapestry’s stock declined nearly 3% in morning trading.</td>

      <td>The Fed is increasing chatter of tapering even as the Delta variant is weighing on the economy</td>
      <td>The economy is still doing very well, but the already bad Covid-19 situation brought on by the Delta variant threatens to get even worse. It is an environment that has put both the Federal Reserve and investors in a fix.<br />Minutes from the Fed’s July meeting, released Wednesday, show that central bank policy makers want to start reducing monthly bond purchases by the end of the year, and there are some at the Fed who would like to start that in short order, say with an announcement at the September meeting. They view the Fed tapering its purchases down to zero—a process that could take the better part of a year—as a necessary condition for raising rates. The sooner it finishes tapering, the sooner they have the option of raising rates.<br />And they would like to at least have the option of raising rates sometime next year. Inflation has been elevated, after all, and though it seems likely it could cool a bit in the months ahead, next year it could still be above the 2% the central bank is targeting. And if businesses keep up the pace of hiring, the economy could be close to the Fed’s goal of full employment.<br />But even though the Delta variant was clearly a problem when Fed policy makers met late last month, it has proved more pernicious than they might have suspected. There have been twice as many Covid cases in the past seven days as in the seven days that ended with the Fed meeting. There are also more than twice as many people now hospitalized with Covid, and in some places hospitals have run out of beds in their intensive care units. Americans are growing more worried, and cautious. A preliminary reading of the University of Michigan’s survey of consumers showed that sentiment dropped sharply this month. The Commerce Department’s retail sales report on Tuesday showed spending softened last month, while credit-card data show further deterioration this month.<br />The juxtaposition of a hawkish leaning Fed and worsening Covid situation is hardly a recipe for quiescent markets. Stocks fell following the release of the minutes, and fell again on Thursday.</td>

Mike Dunleavy criticized the decision Wednesday night, saying it put thousands of potential jobs at risk.<br />U.S. District Judge Sharon Gleason agreed with challengers who argued that the Bureau of Land Management didn’t fully account for the greenhouse gases that would come from burning the oil Willow would produce, among other issues. The plaintiffs, led by the Center for Biological Diversity, included several environmental and Alaskan groups.<br />“As to the errors found by the Court, they are serious,” Judge Gleason, an Obama appointee seated in Anchorage, wrote in her 110-page decision.<br />ConocoPhillips will be reviewing the decision and evaluating its options, a spokesman said.

      <td>Move, which will affect more than 323,000 borrowers, is part of piecemeal effort to provide debt relief</td>
      <td>The Biden administration is wiping out more than $5.8 billion in student loans for more than 323,000 borrowers who are permanently disabled, the latest step in the government’s piecemeal effort to lessen the burden for millions of adults struggling to repay their debts.<br />The Education Department said Thursday it will automatically discharge loans for borrowers with total and permanent disabilities by matching borrower files with Social Security Administration records. A similar policy has been in place since 2019 for those deemed disabled via the Department of Veterans Affairs. Borrowers found to have total and permanent disabilities are generally limited in their ability to work and to repay the loans.<br />The government will also stop asking such borrowers to provide earnings records going forward; currently, failure to respond can lead to loans being reinstated. A 2016 report by the Government Accountability Office found that 98% of reinstated discharges were due to borrowers not submitting documentation, not because borrowers’ earnings were too high.<br />“We are working to improve targeted loan relief and help our borrowers,” said Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, adding that a goal of the department is to simplify the process for borrowers seeking debt relief.<br />President Biden has resisted calls from fellow Democrats and activists to cancel most of America’s roughly $1.6 trillion in federal student-loan debt via executive action. Congressional Republicans would likely block efforts to pass similar measures. They have said plenty of borrowers can afford to pay back their loans, and there are already more targeted relief efforts available to those with financial difficulties, like income-based repayment programs and forbearance.</td>

      <td>After 75 years, adding laughter to TV programs has gone from cutting-edge technology to nostalgic reminder of sitcoms past.</td>
      <td>Is the laugh track finally being taken seriously? Critics have long viewed adding the taped sound of laughter to TV shows as an exercise in mind control and behavior modification. At best, TV viewers have tolerated it as a subliminal necessity on par with elevator music and artificial flavors.<br />But canned laughter, which began after World War II as a way to “sweeten” radio comedies, is now playing a starring role in two cutting-edge TV miniseries, and it may have a future in late night talk shows. After 75 years, the laugh track has taken on a nostalgic power, reminding viewers of midcentury American life and the sitcoms that helped to define the era.<br />During the early months of the pandemic last year, late night TV talk shows had to broadcast without a live audience. Producers didn’t want to replace audience response with a laugh track, to avoid appearing corny, dated or gimmicky. But jokes delivered from a host’s silent den often seemed a lot less funny to at-home viewers. It was hard to discern whether the host was being comedic or serious without the sound of laughter.<br />Research has found that the sound of group laughter is critical to humor’s impact. According to a 2019 study led by Sophie Scott, director of the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London, laughter makes jokes seem funnier, probably because it’s contagious. “The laugh track was introduced initially to take the place of a studio audience and let TV viewers know what was funny,” Prof. Scott says. “Laughter is a form of social bonding. People are 30 times more likely to laugh if there are others with them. They want to be part of the collective experience.”<br />In recent decades, the laugh track has become unfashionable, while incidental music remains essential to TV and film. But the two aren’t as different as they might seem. “Background music is there to build anxiety and fear. The laugh track performs the same role for humor, to trigger an emotional response,” says Robert Thompson, professor of television and popular culture at Syracuse University.</td>

This isn’t a criticism of ending the war, only how it was managed. The chaos was completely predictable and avoidable.<br />André Montero<br />Brooklyn, N.Y.<br /><br />Search as one might, there is no word but “weakness” that could characterize President Biden’s decision. It showed the weakness of the U.S. and its allies to hold back the Taliban fanatics. It showed a weakness to the world community, that the U.S. will stand by neither forces that we fought alongside nor people for whom we fought. When we threatened to leave if the opponent didn’t agree to a deal involving our leaving, it showed a weakness of understanding of what negotiation is all about.

But it fails to address Amtrak’s recent operating and financial success, the economic opportunity, business competitiveness and quality of life Amtrak provides, and what this historic investment means for the future of America.<br />Before the pandemic, Amtrak was setting records for ridership, revenue and financial performance. We were on our way to achieving operational break-even. Revenues equaled more than 99% of operating costs in financial year 2019, and our farebox recovery was the highest among U.S. passenger railroads.<br />Amtrak’s vision to expand rail service and connect new city pairs across America, called Amtrak Connects Us, rises to the urgent challenges of our time and, in partnership with states, host railroads and the federal government, can provide new and improved train service to millions of additional passengers in 160 communities in over 25 states during the next 15 years. This expansion of service will also help create more than half a million well-paying jobs, deliver over $150 billion in economic benefits and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.<br />The reason that the U.S. doesn’t have the same train experience as Europe and Japan is simple: decades of underinvestment in infrastructure. The 19th- and 20th-century infrastructure we rely on wasn’t built to meet today’s demands.<br />With the right investments, we can turn the type of train travel we dream of in this country into a reality with increased reliability, faster train speeds, more train frequencies, reduced trip times and an enhanced overall experience. Sometimes, a lack of progress is what wakes people up.</td>

But the deeper comparison revolves around Mr. Biden’s decision to pull the plug on the Afghan army by abruptly withdrawing logistical, intelligence and close air support and maintenance, then blaming the Afghans for refusing to fight. He did this despite high casualties taken and the disorientation and demoralization his action induced. Mr. Biden thereby showed contempt for the U.S. ally, essentially stating they were unworthy of continued U.S. investment.<br />Such treatment recalls how Congress defunded the South Vietnamese government after the U.S. fully turned over combat operations to the ARVN in 1973. The South soldiered on until 1975, but without funding it had to redeploy to more easily defended combat zones. The resulting retreat turned into a rout, which translated to military collapse.<br />South Vietnamese corruption, incompetence and lack of will to fight was blamed for the debacle, just as Mr. Biden is now denouncing the Afghan government and security forces. In both instances, U.S. government policy ought to shoulder the blame.<br />Em. Prof. Albion M. Urdank<br />University of California, Los Angeles</td>

      <td>WHO Gets It Wrong Again<br />The World Health Organization on Wednesday condemned the U.S. and other wealthy countries such as Israel and Germany for ordering Covid booster shots for their own citizens. There’s insufficient evidence to support the need for third doses, WHO officials said while accusing wealthy countries of behaving selfishly by giving their own citizens added protection while billions around the world remain unvaccinated.<br />“The divide between the haves and have nots will only grow larger if manufacturers and leaders prioritize booster shots over supply to low- and middle-income countries,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. “Vaccine injustice is a shame on all humanity,” Wealthy countries are handing out “extra lifejackets to people who already have lifejackets,” and leaving others “to drown without a single lifejacket,” WHO official Dr. Mike Ryan complained.<br />This analogy doesn’t quite, well, hold water since the U.S. has already donated 110 million vaccines out of its supply to lower-income countries and contracted for another 500 million to donate—three times the 200 million boosters the Biden administration recently ordered for Americans. The administration has also pledged as much as $4 billion to the WHO-backed program Covax to buy vaccines for low-income countries, as a Journal editorial today explains. All told, the U.S. will end up donating more vaccines than it administers to its own citizens.<br />In any case, the WHO shouldn’t be lecturing the U.S. and other wealthy countries about their global public-health obligations. These are the same folks who praised China’s transparency during the early days of the pandemic and waited until mid-January to acknowledge evidence of human-to-human transmission. By that time the virus was spreading stealthily across Europe.</td>

Investors are only just waking up to the risks.<br />On Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping gave a speech about growing wealth inequality and the “promotion of common prosperity.” Luxury investors, who didn’t react to intervention in the Chinese tech and private-education sectors in recent weeks, are belatedly concerned that the country’s super rich could be reined in. A selloff that started on Wednesday and gathered pace on Thursday has wiped 60 billion euros, equivalent to $70.26 billion, from the market value of Europe’s big four names,  LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton ,  Kering, Hermès and Richemont.<br />A wealth-redistribution push in China is potentially bad news for the luxury industry. A small group of very wealthy individuals—numbering only 10,000, according to Jefferies estimates—generates around a quarter of all luxury sales to the Chinese, who are now the industry’s most important shoppers by nationality. The risk of higher taxes and party disapproval may curb these big spenders.<br />Granted, the Chinese middle class still does most of the buying. But previous moves against a small elite had a noticeable impact. In 2012, the Chinese government tackled gift giving, a practice whereby civil servants would accept Louis Vuitton handbags, Cartier watches and expensive cognac in return for favors. In 2013, sales in the global luxury industry increased just 2%, compared with 10%-plus for the previous three years, based on data from consulting firm Bain & Company.<br />Even shareholders in the steadiest luxury brands had a rough time. Between 2013 and 2016, Birkin handbag maker Hermès delivered annual stock-market returns of just 3%, compared with the 35% investors have become accustomed to since 2018.</td>

      <td>More businesses are trying to offset transaction fees with cash discounts and credit-card surcharges; ‘My business is made on the pennies’</td>
      <td>It is getting more expensive to pay for things with a credit card.<br />More small businesses—and even some larger ones—are charging shoppers a fee for credit-card purchases or offering them discounts when they pay with debit cards, cash or checks. The moves are meant to offset the various fees businesses pay on credit-card transactions, costs that have grown alongside generous cash-back and travel rewards.<br />Data on cash discounting is hard to come by, and less than 5% of 8 million card-accepting small businesses in the U.S. charge fees for credit-card payments, according to estimates from payments consultancy the Strawhecker Group. But that share has risen steadily in recent years. Five years ago, an estimated 2% or less of businesses charged fees on credit-card purchases.<br />The coronavirus accelerated the shift, sending businesses in search of revenue to make up for sales lost in the pandemic’s early months. CardX LLC said more than 6,400 merchants—most of them online businesses—use its surcharge-calculating software, up from 4,030 a year ago and 2,380 in 2019.<br />“More merchants have turned toward making those costs transparent to the consumer,” said John Drechny, chief executive of the Merchant Advisory Group, which represents U.S. merchants on payments issues.</td>

Evergrande didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.<br />Evergrande, which is controlled by billionaire businessman Hui Ka Yan, is at the epicenter of a confidence crisis among investors that hold its bonds and the debt securities of other heavily indebted Chinese real-estate companies.</td>

When the album “Pure Heroine” was released in fall 2013, the New Zealand-born Ella Yelich-O’Connor was just 16 years old, and it was immediately obvious that she was a major talent. She sang with a cheerful smirk as she derided the indulgences of her peers—the No. 1 hit “Royals” was a commentary on the celebratory materialism found in pop and hip-hop—but she didn’t spare herself from criticism. Her vocal style, much imitated in the years since, was all her own.<br />Reality shows like “American Idol” had steered young pop stars toward technical displays, but Lorde delivered her lyrics in a half-spoken, rap-like cadence that went from a whisper to a sneer. Powered by “Royals,” which won Grammys for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance, “Pure Heroine” hit No. 3 on the charts.</td>

      <td>The global semiconductor shortage has finally started to bite at  Toyota  Motor Corp., highlighting how prolonged disruptions in the global supply chain in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic are hitting even the best-prepared companies.<br />Japan’s largest car maker said Thursday it was cutting production in the country by 40% in September because of a shortage of semiconductors. The company declined to say whether it would shut down plants outside of Japan.<br />The cuts affect most of Toyota’s plants in Japan and some of its bestselling vehicles. One of Toyota’s main plants near its headquarters in Toyota City, which produces both the RAV4 sport-utility vehicle and Corolla sedan, will close from Sept. 1 to Sept. 17. The nearby Tsutsumi plant that produces the Camry and Lexus ES sedans faces a similar period of closure.<br />“We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to our customers and suppliers,” Toyota said.<br />The latest problem to hit Toyota and other car makers is a resurgence in Covid-19 infections in Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia, where semiconductors are assembled into small components that control everything from engines to headlights. The spread of the highly infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus and relatively low vaccination rates have caused sharp production cuts because governments forced plants to limit operations.</td>

The epicenter of the quake was located about 7.5 miles from the southern town of Saint-Louis du Sud and 78 miles from the capital, Port-au-Prince, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It had a depth of 6.2 miles.<br />Around 53,000 homes were destroyed and another 77,000 damaged in the quake, while 127 schools and 60 churches were knocked down or damaged, civil protection authorities reported. The port city of Les Cayes, which has a population of about 125,000, was among the hardest hit, and hospitals there were overwhelmed by the number of injured.<br />As of late Wednesday, fatalities from the disaster had risen to 2,189, most in the departments of Sud, Nippes and Grand’Anse, which occupy the western portion of the southern peninsula. More than 12,000 people were injured and 332 people reported missing.<br />Emergency aid has been flown into Haiti from a number of countries in the region including the U.S., Venezuela, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and the Dominican Republic, which occupies the eastern side of the Caribbean island it shares with Haiti, called Hispaniola.

      <td>Maker of chip testing equipment was hit too early by fears of a peak in the semiconductor cycle</td>
      <td>Three months ago, chip-testing equipment maker  FormFactor  looked like a company in the wrong place at the wrong time. The truth is actually the opposite.<br />Semiconductor stocks were riding high earlier this year amid a chip production shortage that has crippled industries from automotive to consumer electronics. That shortage has driven chip manufacturers to boost expansion plans to keep up with demand, which in turn fueled stock prices in the sector. The PHLX Semiconductor Index hit a decade-high valuation of more than 27 times forward earnings by mid-February.<br />Naturally, that sparked worry among more seasoned investors long accustomed to the chip equipment industry’s cyclical nature. So when FormFactor posted its first-quarter results in late April, investors were looking hard for any signs of a peak. FormFactor’s disappointing gross margin projection for the second quarter triggered a hard selloff, costing the company nearly one-third of its market value over the next two weeks.<br />The stock has recovered only a bit of ground since, putting its year-to-date loss at 19%. By contrast, the 30 largest U.S.-listed companies in the semiconductor equipment space have averaged a year-to-date gain of 24%, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. FormFactor’s share price has budged little since its second-quarter results on July 28 that showed gross margins coming in better than the company had originally expected.<br />A beaten-down stock creates an opportunity, given FormFactor’s unique position to capitalize on shifts going on in semiconductor manufacturing. The company specializes in probe cards that allow semiconductor manufacturers to test chips at the wafer level, thus saving on the cost of separating and packaging bad chips.</td>

The new retail spaces will be around 30,000 square feet, smaller than most department stores, which typically occupy about 100,000 square feet, and will offer items from top consumer brands. The Amazon stores will dwarf many of the company’s other physical retail spaces and will have a footprint similar to scaled-down formats that Bloomingdale’s Inc.,  Nordstrom Inc.  and other department-store chains have begun opening, the people said.<br />It is unclear what brands Amazon will offer in the stores, although the company’s private-label goods are expected to feature prominently, the people said. Amazon sells scores of products including clothes, furniture, batteries and electronic devices through many of its own labels. The plans aren’t yet final and could change, these people said.<br />Amazon’s plans represent an evolution in the company’s efforts to move into bricks-and-mortar retail after years of taking market share from big-box operators—moves that helped to push many into bankruptcy. The company’s growth in online shopping helped accelerate the fall of mall operators and other once-potent physical-store empires.

      <td>Garden parties may be back in vogue, but no one can throw a summer bash like Jay Gatsby. For a stylish page-turner, why not dip back into F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic tale of indulgence and spirit during a sweltering season in the Roaring ’20s.</td>
      <td>NEW YORK in the summer—hot, hazy, the streets steaming—calls for nothing so much as a garden party. At least that’s what Jay Gatsby, the mysteriously moneyed protagonist of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s best-loved novel, “The Great Gatsby,” might say. “By seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived,” Fitzgerald writes of one of Gatsby’s famous bashes. “The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other’s names.” It’s an extrovert’s dream.<br />Fans of the book praise Fitzgerald’s ability to capture the instability and malaise of the interwar period. He is also, perhaps, our best chronicler of parties. In Fitzgerald’s world, merrymaking matters. The ostentatious gatherings in “The Great Gatsby,” first published in 1925, are shot through with a sense of possibility: Who knows who you might meet?<br />When Gatsby’s neighbor, Nick Carraway, who also serves as the book’s narrator, attends his first shindig next door, he observes guests who are “agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key.” Gatsby has his own motives. Perhaps his long-ago love, Daisy, now living just across Long Island Sound, will wander into the sprawl one day. Anything could happen, and no one would have to know. One frequent attendee remarks: “I like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”<br />For those of us ready to entertain again, and craving the intimacy of a large party, ripe with risk and opportunity, there is no better reading than “The Great Gatsby.” The summer may be long and lazy, but “Gatsby,” almost a century on, remains hard and glittery. It’s a tonic for listlessness, bracing and sharp, like a gin cocktail on a sweltering afternoon.<br />Techy innovation rarely makes an appearance in Gatsby’s world—unless you count his telephone—but cars and driving are central to the action and function as a kind of extension of each character’s personality. Jordan Baker, the competitive golfer who plays loose with the truth, is a terrible driver, passing so close to pedestrians that her “fender flicked a button on one man’s coat.” She tells Nick she likes him while whizzing down the road (“I hate careless people. That’s why I like you.”) Meanwhile, Daisy drives to steady her nerves—with disastrous results. Gatsby’s car (shown) is, fittingly, over-the-top, a “rich cream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hat-boxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of wind-shields that mirrored a dozen suns.”</td>

      <td>Colleges and universities are wrestling with how to treat, and budget for, unvaccinated students, with a few schools making those students pay to be tested regularly for Covid-19.<br />At the University of Texas, Austin, the difference between a student vaccination rate of 60% and 80% would cost the school about $4 million to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and treat additional students projected to get infected, the head of the school’s Covid-19 Modeling Consortium said.<br />If fewer students return to campus vaccinated, the school will spend more on tests, contact tracing, quarantine housing and online classes, said Dr. Lauren Meyers, a professor of integrative biology and data science who directs the consortium. The school recommends vaccines, but state law prevents them from being mandated.<br />“There are these two different worlds: There’s a world where we do all this mitigation, it’s successful enough that we could actually safely continue school in person and we don’t have to go online,” she said. “Or there’s the world where we don’t do enough to mitigate, or there’s not enough vaccination in the community, and we’re forced to go online and that incurs additional cost to UT.”<br />The consortium modeled 35 scenarios with student vaccination coverage ranging from 40% to 80% in a recent report. It estimates that 57% of the school’s 50,000 students would be fully vaccinated when classes start on Aug. 25 and about 209 would arrive on campus for the fall semester infected with Covid-19.</td>

      <td>Some peer-to-peer trading and lending projects have features that may trigger the need for regulation, chairman says</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—A new breed of digital asset exchanges is potentially the holy grail for cryptocurrencies: online places for people to trade and lend that purportedly involve no middleman setting the rules or taking fees.<br />But these peer-to-peer networks, so far completely unregulated in the U.S., may not be immune from oversight, said Gary Gensler, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Some decentralized finance projects, known as DeFi, have features that make them look like the types of entities the SEC oversees, Mr. Gensler said in an interview Wednesday.<br />DeFi developers write software that automates transactions and say they then step away from the project, allowing it to operate with no central entity in charge. They argue that such decentralization defeats the need for oversight by the SEC, which has said that some cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ether, are sufficiently decentralized to avoid regulation.<br />But Mr. Gensler, who took over in April, said projects that reward participants with valuable digital tokens or similar incentives could cross a line into activity that should be regulated, no matter how “decentralized” they say they are.<br />“There’s still a core group of folks that are not only writing the software, like the open source software, but they often have governance and fees,” Mr. Gensler said. “There’s some incentive structure for those promoters and sponsors in the middle of this.”</td>

      <td>Closely watched spread between five- and 30-year Treasury yields has hardly changed after falling sharply when the Fed shifted its message in June</td>
      <td>A key bond-market signal suggests investors feel they have a firm grip on Federal Reserve policy, reducing the chances that the central bank’s Jackson Hole conference next week will break yields from their recent pattern.<br />For nearly two months, the extra yield investors demand to hold the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond over the five-year note has been mostly hovering just below 1.2 percentage points. The closely watched differential—known on Wall Street as the 5-30 spread—dropped sharply from about 1.4 percentage points after the Fed’s June 15-16 policy meeting.<br />Investors and analysts pay close attention to the 5-30 spread because it can show how near-term monetary policy is expected to affect the long-term economic outlook. In the early days of an economic expansion, the spread tends to be large because investors expect easy-money policies to help spur growth and inflation. The spread then tends to shrink as the Fed raises interest rates to cool the economy.<br />This year, the gap between five- and 30-year Treasury yields initially increased partly because Fed leaders were promising unusually easy policies even as investors were anticipating an especially strong economic rebound.<br />The Fed last year formally adopted a new policy framework centered on letting inflation run above the central bank’s 2% target for some period to balance out the time it spent below that level. That raised the possibility the central bank could wait much longer than it had in the past to raise interest rates. The prospect cheered those who thought such an approach could lead to a stronger, broader-based expansion while worrying others who feared it could result in runaway inflation.</td>

That would be the lowest level since the pandemic took hold in the U.S. in March 2020.

But while that might cause the pace of growth to ease, some economists say the dynamic between Covid-19 and economic activity has evolved over the past year.<br />“The data we’re seeing shows that while certain consumer areas may be starting to cool, activity does remain solid and labor demand remains extremely strong,” said Robert Rosener, senior U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. Mr. Rosener said rising numbers of Covid-19 cases wouldn’t necessarily translate to a significant increase in jobless claims.</td>

      <td>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said Thursday it agreed to acquire the money-management operation of Dutch insurer NN Group NV for about $1.87 billion, as the need for scale in the asset-management business to lower costs drives sector consolidation.<br />The New York-based investment bank said it plans to merge NN Investment Partners with its Goldman Sachs Asset Management arm to gain access to a bigger pool of retail and institutional investors in Europe and bolster its product offerings in areas such as European equities, investment-grade credit and green bonds.<br />NN Investment—which the deal values at about €1.6 billion, equivalent to $1.87 billion—has about 75% of its holdings in debt securities, according to an investment presentation on the business. The rest is split between equity and multiasset portfolios that combine different holdings including bonds, equities and commodities.<br />GSAM oversees $2.3 trillion in assets globally across investments including stocks, bonds, private equity and commodities. The acquisition of NN Investment would add almost $350 billion to that total. More specifically, GSAM’s assets in Europe would roughly double to more than $600 billion.<br />That aligns “with the firm’s strategic objectives to scale its European business and extend its global reach,” the bank said in a statement.</td>

      <td>NEW ORLEANS—A Texas law outlawing an abortion method commonly used to end second-trimester pregnancies was upheld Wednesday by a federal appeals court in New Orleans.<br />The 2017 law has never been enforced. It seeks to prohibit the use of forceps to remove a fetus from the womb—what supporters of the law call a “dismemberment abortion”—without first using an injected drug or a suction procedure to ensure the fetus is dead.<br />Abortion-rights advocates argued that the law, known as SB8 in court records, effectively outlaws what is often the safest method of abortion for women in the second trimester of pregnancy—a procedure medically known as dilation and evacuation. They also argued that fetuses cannot feel pain during the gestation period affected by the law, and that one alternative outlined by the state, the use of suction to remove a fetus, also results in dismemberment.<br />A three-judge panel of the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked enforcement of the law last year. But Texas sought, and was granted, a rehearing by the full court.<br />A majority among the 14 appellate judges who heard arguments in January (three of the court’s 17 active judges were recused) sided with Texas. The opinion, by judges Jennifer Walker Elrod and Don Willett, said “the record shows that doctors can safely perform D&Es and comply with SB8 using methods that are already in widespread use.”</td>

He tweeted his escape and noted that he was told Taliban fighters were going door to door demanding to know where he was.<br />It was clear why they were looking for Mr. Ahmady. His knowledge of the previous government’s financial standing would be valuable to the new regime. In addition to the funding from the opium trade and extortion schemes that fuel Taliban operations, the group thought it was positioned to inherit a large amount of cash from the International Monetary Fund next week.<br />Current estimates suggest there may be more than $9 billion in foreign-currency reserves on hold by the Afghan central bank. Over the weekend, Treasury officials assured Congress that these funds are held largely outside the country and can’t be accessed by the Taliban, and last week the Biden administration canceled shipments of cash that were headed to Kabul.<br />But there is one source of money the Taliban could have had access to in a matter of days: Special Drawing Rights from the IMF. Over the past six months, the fund has gone through a complicated process to approve an allocation of SDRs worth roughly $650 billion to its 190 member countries. In early August, the IMF’s Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva deftly negotiated an agreement among the U.S., China and the European Union to approve an unprecedented amount of money, beyond usual IMF financing, to help stabilize emerging and developing economies as they recover from the economic downturn caused by the pandemic.<br />Under this agreement, every member country gets SDRs. That includes countries that don’t need them, like the U.S. and China, and countries like Iran and Taliban-controlled Afghanistan that will likely use them to fund illicit activity. Per the agreement, the Taliban would have received the equivalent of over $400 million from the IMF.</td>

      <td>As dawn broke on Aug. 19, 1991, tanks and armored cars converged on Moscow and Soviet citizens received the stunning news that President Mikhail Gorbachev had been overthrown in a coup. At 6:06 a.m., the news agency Tass announced that he had been removed for reasons of health, and power was in the hands of a shadowy group calling itself the State Committee for the Emergency Situation.<br />For the next three days, the fate of the world hung in the balance. Four thousand troops, 350 tanks and 300 armored personnel carriers poured into the capital. The coup leaders ordered 250,000 pairs of handcuffs from a factory in Pskov and printed thousands of blank forms authorizing administrative arrest. A protester scrawled on a wall: “Communism will not be saved by martial law.” He was arrested by KGB agents and told, “From today on, it is not allowed to write any slogans.”<br />The coup leaders counted on a massive show of force and a quick victory. But the Soviet Union was no longer the totalitarian society that existed before Mr. Gorbachev initiated the policy of free information known as glasnost.<br />As soldiers took up positions on Tverskaya Street, members of the intelligentsia rushed to leave the country, and there were bread riots in the stores.<br />In a fatal display of unjustified overconfidence, however, the coup leaders didn’t arrest Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, then a constituent republic of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin turned the seat of the Russian government, known as the White House, into a center of resistance and made a speech from the top of a tank denouncing the coup as an illegal seizure of power.</td>

      <td>The Taliban haven’t formally taken any Americans captive in Afghanistan, at least not yet, but it’s clear that the jihadists already have the Biden Administration as a political hostage. That was obvious from Wednesday’s briefing at the Pentagon, where the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff admitted they lack the military resources and political mandate to ensure that every American is evacuated amid the Taliban control of Kabul.<br />There was no lack of determination to do so on the part of Secretary Lloyd Austin and Gen. Mark Milley, both of whom fought in Afghanistan. One or the other said more than once that they view their mission as getting out “all American citizens” who want to leave the country now in Taliban hands.<br />The problem is the U.S. military now controls only the Hamid Karzai International Airport (HKIA) with about 4,500 troops. Americans, foreign nationals and some Afghans who manage to make it to the airport are able to board flights to depart. But Americans and Afghans are on their own in trying to make it to the airport, which means getting past multiple Taliban checkpoints in the city and surrounding the airport perimeter.<br />Mr. Austin said that, so far, the Taliban are allowing U.S. citizens who have passports to get through. But the Taliban are not letting most Afghans through, and many who are trying are beaten and who knows what else. Many Americans and Afghan allies are also spread around the country and will have to find a way to get to the airport.<br />Pressed by reporters on whether the military could leave the airport and get Americans, or extend the airport perimeter, or create a safe-passage corridor from Kabul, Mr. Austin said he couldn’t do any of those and keep the airport secure. That means he’s also depending on the goodwill of the Taliban to let our people and our allies go.</td>

      <td>A Fulton County probe could end in a state takeover—or reform.</td>
      <td>As Georgia probes Fulton County’s election (mis)management, the best response from partisans would be to take a deep breath. This is about accountability for a long record of mistakes. It isn’t about President Trump’s specious fraud claims, and it isn’t a threat to democracy.<br />The state Board of Elections on Wednesday named a bipartisan panel to do a performance review of Fulton County, which includes most of Atlanta. The process could eventually lead, under Georgia’s new voting law, to a suspension of Fulton’s board of elections. Democrats say the exercise is a GOP plot to disenfranchise Atlanta.<br />But the law specifies a long, detailed process: First comes the performance review. Two of the new panel’s members are election officials from other parts of the state, including a Democrat from neighboring Gwinnett County. The third is Ryan Germany, the general counsel for the Secretary of State, best known nationally for rejecting Mr. Trump’s fraud claims on that infamous taped phone call.<br />The law says the review panel must issue a report with “evaluations, judgments, and recommendations.” The state elections board may then investigate and hold hearings. Suspension finally comes only if the Fulton board is found to have repeatedly violated election rules and regulations or “demonstrated nonfeasance, malfeasance, or gross negligence.”<br />Also, this review isn’t without cause, as even a Democratic member of the state board admitted. “The narrative driving this pressure has been influenced by disinformation surrounding the November 2020 election,” she said, “but the fact remains that Fulton County voters have reported numerous problems for far longer than November 2020, particularly surrounding registration and absentee ballots.”</td>

      <td>Give the Biden Administration credit for endorsing Covid booster shots in defiance of the World Health Organization scolds who have been wrong on nearly every major public health issue during the pandemic.<br />The Administration on Wednesday said it will recommend boosters of the  Pfizer  and Moderna mRNA vaccines eight months after people received their second dose, starting Sept. 20. Earlier this summer the Administration had pushed back on claims by vaccine makers that boosters would probably be necessary.<br />But recent evidence, including three new studies mentioned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday, changed their opinions. While vaccines still appear to be highly protective against severe illness, they are becoming somewhat less effective against mild and moderate symptoms because antibodies decline over time and can be evaded by the Delta variant.<br />One study found that the vaccine efficacy against hospitalization in New York has remained relatively stable (92% to 95%). However, efficacy against all infections declined to 80% from 92% from early May to late July. Another study showed that mRNA vaccines remained 84% to 86% protective against hospitalization over 24 weeks after the second dose.<br />This should be mostly reassuring to vaccinated individuals, but a more worrisome study found that mRNA vaccines were only 75% effective against infection among nursing home residents from March to May and 53% in June and July. This could explain why infections and hospitalizations among the elderly are rising even in states where the vast majority of seniors are vaccinated.</td>

      <td>I’ll take the $948 the IRS put in my bank account—but I feel bad about it.</td>
      <td>Deposits of $948 hit my bank account on July 15 and Aug. 13. The money came from the Internal Revenue Service, but it isn’t a tax refund. I shouldn’t be getting this money at all.<br />My family is receiving the new Advance Child Tax Credit Payments, passed by Congress and signed into law by President Biden in March. Under this policy, I’m going to make more than $11,000 by the time I file my 2021 taxes. I “earned” this extra cash by having four children between 5 and 13.<br />The policy—which pays $300 a month for each child under 6 and $250 a month for each child between 6 and 17—is set to expire at year’s end, yet the Biden administration and congressional Democrats are pushing to make it permanent. If that happens, I’m looking at more than $10,000 a year for the next four years, then thousands more annually for nearly a decade after that.<br />Do I need this money? Thankfully, no. I have a good job that puts my family solidly in the middle class. Should I be getting this money? Absolutely not. But will I use the money? Yes. That is why this new entitlement is so dangerous.<br />The federal government is conditioning families like mine to expect “free” money. When you see that cash in your account, the first thought is how to use it. It becomes a habit to see and spend extra money each month. Like many habits, it is liable to worsen.</td>

      <td>The legislators who fled to block a voting bill are about to get their bluff called.</td>
      <td>The drama in Texas over election reform is drawing to a close.<br />A week ago last Monday, the Texas Senate held hearings on S.B.1 and opened debate Wednesday. Sen. Carol Alvarado, a respected Houston Democrat, then filibustered the bill with a 15-hour speech that began early Wednesday evening and ended Thursday at about 9 a.m. As she concluded her filibuster, Ms. Alvarado was surrounded by Democratic colleagues, then congratulated by some Republican senators for her grit. The Senate still passed the election-reform bill on a party-line vote, 18-11.<br />Meanwhile, Democratic state representatives are drifting back from Washington, where 56 of them had fled to deny the House a quorum to conduct business. They seem to have left Texas with a superspreader among them, as five later said they’d tested positive for Covid despite being vaccinated. Apparently bored by the nation’s capital, two Democrats also reportedly hit the Portugal beaches in secret before being discovered.<br />Rumors are that 95 or so of the 100 representatives needed for a quorum are in Austin. Other Democrats are reportedly looking for face-saving ways to show up for work so the special session can finish its business and go sine die.<br />Yet though it didn’t stop S.B.1, Ms. Alvarado’s filibuster helped clarify what this disturbance is about. It’s not the bill’s increase in the number of required hours for the state’s already-generous early-voting period, its mandate that more medium-size counties hold weekend early voting, the simplified procedures for verifying absentee ballots, or the requirement that mail-in voters be able to cure online, by phone, or in-person any mistakes in their ballot.</td>

      <td>Biden extended a Trump order blocking our return if we visit family in Britain.</td>
      <td>My wife and I arrived in New York in May 2019 with our children, then 2, 5 and 9. They haven’t seen their grandparents since. So it came as a huge relief last month when the U.K. announced that fully vaccinated British expats living in the U.S. could return home without quarantining.<br />But U.S. regulations still stand in our way. In January President Biden signed a proclamation continuing Donald Trump’s suspension of entry of certain travelers from countries including the U.K. and most of Europe. So while American citizens and permanent residents can now travel freely, subject to a negative Covid test before boarding a flight to the U.S., most nonresident visa holders aren’t allowed to return to America—where my family lawfully lives, our children go to school, and I work and pay taxes—unless we spend 14 days in another country that doesn’t have a banning order.<br />Draconian restrictions were understandable at the start of a deadly pandemic. But what sense does it make to have different rules for permanent residents and other foreign nationals who live here legally? Even more confusing is why travelers from the U.K., where 60% of the population is fully vaccinated, can enter only after two weeks in a country such as Mexico, where the vaccination rate is 23%.<br />Moving our kids across the ocean was a big step for our family. We didn’t return the first year because we’d been told by friends it would unsettle the children. Then came Covid. Social media and apps like FaceTime kept distant relationships going, but they’ve become merely a reminder that we can’t see family. “When are we going to see grandma and grandad?” the kids keep asking. My wife and I have given up trying to come up with a convincing answer.<br />Mr. Kelly is a senior producer for the Journal’s editorial page.</td>

      <td>Two years after signing the Business Roundtable statement, companies still prioritize shareholders.</td>
      <td>Corporate leaders have been busy presenting themselves as guardians of the interests of “stakeholders,” such as customers, employees, suppliers and communities as well as shareholders. Our recent research, however, casts serious doubt on whether corporations are matching the talk with action.<br />Aug. 19 marks the second anniversary of the Business Roundtable’s Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation. Signed by the CEOs of many major U.S. companies, the statement committed them to deliver value to all stakeholders, not only shareholders.<br />Last summer we reported in these pages our findings that CEOs who signed the Business Roundtable statement didn’t obtain the approval of their boards. Because board approval is commonly sought for any major decision, we inferred that the CEOs didn’t view the statement as a meaningful commitment to change how they do business. But some critics argued that the lack of board approval didn’t prove much. So we dug deeper, investigating an array of corporate documents for the 136 public U.S. companies whose CEOs signed the statement.<br />Fidelity National Information Services CEO Gary Norcross called the statement on corporate purpose a “transformative statement” and Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said it “broadened the responsibility of corporate America to all stakeholders.” But we found evidence that the signatory CEOs didn’t intend to make any significant changes to how they do business.<br />We’ve identified almost 100 signatory companies that updated their corporate governance guidelines by the end of 2020. We found that the companies that made updates generally didn’t add any language that elevates the status of stakeholders, and most of them reaffirmed governance principles supporting shareholder primacy.</td>

      <td>Meet the next member of the United Nations General Assembly: the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. New York City’s commercial real-estate sector soon will be showing space available for the Taliban’s U.N. delegation. This, in the world according to Joe Biden, is what normalcy looks like.<br />The Taliban, despite their earned reputation for homicidal insanity, are playing Barack Obama’s former vice president with the rational cunning of an Iranian foreign minister.<br />Kabul is in chaos. Mr. Biden said the city would never look like the fall of Saigon, but it is worse than that because this time the whole world is watching the humiliation of America in real time on TV.<br />The evacuation crisis in Kabul is the pivotal event of the final scene in the Afghan drama. The Taliban, having consolidated control of the country, had two choices this week: Give some 15,000 remaining U.S. citizens safe passage to Karzai International Airport, or refuse safe passage and risk combat with American forces, though even the U.S. promise of retaliation might not be certain with Mr. Biden.<br />Because of the evacuation crisis, the Taliban hold nearly all the leverage against the U.S. in defining the postwar status quo. In his press briefing Tuesday, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the Taliban “have to prove to the international community who they will end up being.” Imagine how easy this call must be for the Taliban, as it luxuriates in dealing with the U.S. as an equal negotiating partner in plain view of every actor in global politics.</td>

      <td>Customers and investors alike feel cheated and apprehensive when companies violate basic business norms. There is a better way.</td>
      <td>Ralph Waldo Emerson is rarely invoked when people are discussing business and national economies, but he captured a nice point when he observed that “distrust is very expensive.” When individuals lack confidence in the quality and reliability of the products they’re buying—from meatloaf to mutual funds—commercial exchange is impeded and economic growth thwarted. It’s no coincidence that countries with high levels of distrust have high rates of poverty as well.<br />The U.S. experienced an episode of mass distrust in 2008, when collapsed confidence in the banking system sent the economy into a tailspin. Today, with the products and policies of major companies becoming ever more deeply integrated into our lives—particularly companies in the technology sector—there is ever more need for chief executives and their teams to build trust and maintain it.<br />That is the backdrop to “The Power of Trust” by Sandra Sucher and Shalene Gupta, a Harvard Business School professor and research associate, respectively. The authors provide an overview of trust’s role in business, drawing on academic studies and describing companies that have fostered trust, lost it or regained it. Their goal, they say, is to provide readers with a road map “to build, improve, recover, or sustain the trust of the people and groups who rely on you, and whom you rely on, to build a thriving business.”<br />The road map they provide follows a four-part design in which each element contributes to trust in business. The first part centers on competence, which refers to a company’s ability to deliver what it has promised. The next part takes up motives: Does a company have what the authors characterize as “good intentions”? The third part addresses means—“the fairness of your processes and treatment of people when distributing rewards and pain points.” The fourth part registers the “impact”—both intended and unintended—of a company’s actions on the consumers it serves and the communities in which it operates.<br />None of these elements alone is sufficient to achieve trust, the authors say, and progress in each ultimately depends on companies having their houses in order: “To establish trust with your customers,” Ms. Sucher and Ms. Gupta write, “you need to first establish it with your employees and create processes and standards internally to ensure your products or services are up to standard.”</td>

      <td>Former Purdue Pharma LP president Richard Sackler distanced himself from a program pitched years ago by consulting giant McKinsey & Co. to increase OxyContin sales and denied that his family or the company are responsible for the opioid epidemic.<br />Dr. Sackler said that although he remembered having a call with McKinsey about research it had done for the drugmaker, he said during testimony on Wednesday in Purdue’s bankruptcy trial he didn’t recall some details about certain marketing and sale programs including an initiative called “Evolve to Excellence” that federal authorities have alleged led healthcare providers to write medically-unnecessary prescriptions of OxyContin, an opioid painkiller.<br />McKinsey agreed earlier this year to a $573 million settlement with state authorities over advice it gave Purdue and other drugmakers on opioid painkillers, without admitting wrongdoing.<br />Dr. Sackler’s testimony about the E2E program came during the second week of a bankruptcy trial scrutinizing a proposed settlement of litigation against he and other members of Purdue’s controlling family alleging they bear responsibility for fueling the opioid crisis. If approved, the agreement would shield the Sacklers from civil lawsuits over OxyContin in exchange for roughly $4.5 billion from family members to fund opioid abatement programs.<br />The family would also cede control of Purdue under the proposal, which is being challenged by a handful of state and federal authorities.</td>

      <td>As demand remains high, company’s profit nearly quadruples</td>
      <td>Graphics-chip maker  Nvidia Corp.  benefited from continued hot demand for devices from computer videogamers and cryptocurrency miners, pushing its sales and profit to records in its most recent quarter.<br />Nvidia has been one of the tech companies that profited most handsomely from the pandemic-era economy, when millions of people turned to videogames, online services and other home-based activities during lockdowns.<br />Sales rose by 68% to $6.51 billion in the period ended in July, the company said. Net profit nearly quadrupled, reaching $2.37 billion.<br />The company’s latest generation of graphics cards are popular with computer gamers for whom high-quality images and fast frame-rates are prized. Its high-end cards have sold out fast, and resellers have responded to demand by buying available stocks and marking them up well above their list price.<br />The cards are also well-suited to the computing-power demands of cryptocurrency mining. To avoid that demand crimping the supply of components for gamers, Nvidia sells products specifically for the digital-currency creation market. It also has put in place software designed to limit the usefulness of its gaming cards for crypto-mining. Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said more than 80% of the company’s latest graphics cards had those limiters on them, adding that crypto-specific chips would be a minimal contributor to future revenue.</td>
