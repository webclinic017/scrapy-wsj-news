But as a reminder of why tough love is needed, the U.S. Postal Service said Wednesday that in fiscal 2021 it lost another $4.9 billion.<br />This is the USPS’s 15th straight annual loss, a running tab of $92 billion since 2007. It’s real money: President Biden’s infrastructure bill will spend $110 billion on roads and bridges. Mr. DeJoy is trying to do what Congress asked, which is to run the post office like a business, despite the many political mandates it must cope with. He’s raising prices and shifting mail from expensive planes to cheaper trucks. Last year’s loss was almost twice as big, $9.2 billion.</td>

Almost 20% of the Big Apple’s commercial property sits empty because of functional obsolescence and the rise of remote work. At the same time, the city faces a serious housing crisis. A simple solution would be to start converting vacant office space into apartments.<br />Adaptive reuse would increase the supply of homes in transit-rich locations already built for density, without encroaching on historic residential enclaves. It would breathe life back into neighborhoods whose small businesses and restaurants are reeling from the pandemic. Recycling obsolete office buildings is also great for the environment. The construction is far greener, and it should also reduce carbon emissions because so many of the best candidates for conversion can be occupied by people who walk to work.</td>

Even worse, the bill threatens to turn potentially transformative policies into something temporary that angers voters and returns Republicans to power. To save President Biden’s progressive legacy, Democrats must focus on a few core priorities that can be delivered in a sustainable way.<br />Unlike the economies of 2009 or 2020, today’s economy won’t benefit from deficit-financed stimulus. Unemployment is nearing pre-pandemic levels, while inflation has skyrocketed to 6.2%, double or triple what most economists think optimal.</td>

      <td>Is charitable giving from major foundations and wealthy donors really just a form of self-interest—an attempt at ‘reputation-washing’?</td>
      <td>Generosity is practically everywhere regarded as a virtue, but the large-scale giving of foundations, corporations and individual wealthy donors—“wholesale philanthropy,” as it has been called—routinely elicits skepticism. “Philanthropy,” one of Oscar Wilde’s characters says, “seems . . . to have become simply the refuge of people who wish to annoy their fellow creatures.” When Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller began giving away their fortunes in the early 20th century, critics questioned their motives and called for would-be recipients to reject such “tainted” money. Congress has periodically investigated what philanthropists have been up to and placed a variety of restrictions on them.<br />As Beth Breeze notes in “In Defence of Philanthropy,” such attacks have recently become “increasingly vocal” and faced “little pushback.” Despite the progressive aims of many major foundations and wealthy philanthropists, most critics these days come from the left side of the ideological spectrum, such as Stanford University’s Rob Reich and Anand Giridharadas, a commentator and author (“Winners Take All”). They seeorganized giving as an effort to empower the rich at the expense of everyone else, worsening inequality rather than reducing it and covering dubiously made fortunes with a veneer of do-goodery. They want to make charity more accountable to the public by limiting donor control and adding to government oversight.</td>

But their article only scratches the surface by referencing the financial impact on retail stockholders and 401(k) plans.<br />Far more consequential would be the effect on public pension plans, which control approximately $34 trillion is assets world-wide, and hold trillions in U.S. equities. Every U.S. state, county and city sponsors pension funds that hold substantial assets invested in the public equity market to benefit the retirement security of firemen, policemen, teachers and other public-sector workers. The colossal equity-market selloff triggered by a billionaires’ tax would negatively affect the retirement security of tens of millions of U.S. workers covered by these public pension plans. It would also have a devastating knock-on effect on the fiscal health of states and municipalities, all of which are required to make annual calculations of unfunded pension liabilities.

      <td>The world changed on Nov. 15, 1971, and hardly anyone noticed. It is the 50th anniversary of the launch of the  Intel  4004 microprocessor, a computer carved onto silicon, an element as plentiful on earth as sand on a beach. Microprocessors unchained computers from air-conditioned rooms and freed computing power to go wherever it is needed most. Life has improved exponentially since.<br />Back then,  IBM  mainframes were kept in sealed rooms and were so expensive companies used argon gas instead of water to put out computer-room fires. Workers were told to evacuate on short notice, before the gas would suffocate them. Feeding decks of punch cards into a reader and typing simple commands into clunky Teletype machines were the only ways to interact with the IBM computers. Digital Equipment Corp. sold PDP-8 minicomputers to labs and offices that weighed 250 pounds.</td>

      <td>Opioid medications are like guns. Both are useful and lawful but prone to abuse and potentially lethal. The Oklahoma Supreme Court last week struck down a $465 million opioid award against  Johnson & Johnson  based on a legal theory that has previously been tried and failed against guns—that the product was a “public nuisance.” Commentators described the Oklahoma decision as “shocking,” but it was predictable. Yet it leaves the matter far from resolved.<br />Opioid litigation has proceeded like a locomotive in part because of Judge Dan Aaron Polster, a federal jurist in Ohio who has been given control of some 2,000 federal cases from across the country under the multidistrict litigation system. The plaintiffs generally allege that the industry flooded states with prescription opioids and caused an epidemic of addiction. Forty-eight states, including Oklahoma, have brought lawsuits based on the same theory. Judge Polster pushed drug makers to settle before clearly establishing legal liability. He now presides in a trial that could hold pharmacies liable for opioid abuse.</td>

For Pearl herself, wearing lipstick was about more than vanity—there was a principle at stake. “It wasn’t a desire to create trouble when the suit was filed,” she explained at the time. “I’m going to fight the case to a finish in an effort to uphold women’s rights to use all reasonable means to look their best at all times.”</td>

      <td>Humble ‘retro’ corded headphones are making an unexpected return, for both aesthetic and practical reasons</td>
      <td>Everyone wears AirPods these days…right? Since  Apple  launched the Bluetooth-enabled headphones in 2016, they’ve become an inescapable feature of daily life: Countless people walk around, chat, run and work with those two little knobs sticking out of their ears. If you are among them, you may right now be considering buying a new pair, namely the 3rd-generation version that launched last month featuring “spatial audio.” What is spatial audio? I don’t quite understand it myself, but it sounds exciting! The prevalence of AirPods makes them critical to Apple’s wearables business, which generated $38.3 billion in net sales from September 2020 to September 2021.<br />In short, AirPods have become too widespread to be cool. So, perhaps inevitably, contrarian trendsetters are reviving some ancient technology: corded headphones. Fashionable young celebrities including Bella Hadid, Lily-Rose Depp and Zoë Kravitz have been photographed strutting around town with blatantly corded headphones. An Instagram account called @wireditgirls has sprung up to document these cords in the wild. And TikTokers record videos that offer both practical reasons and more philosophical justifications for plugging back in.</td>

Smart meters and other technology help homeowners optimize their energy usage.<br />The thought of navigating the options to decarbonize your home might seem daunting, so we broke it down using research and guidance from the Rocky Mountain Institute, which deals in sustainability issues.</td>

      <td>Paul Rudd and Will Ferrell star, respectively, as a manipulative psychotherapist and one of his patient-victims in an Apple TV+ series based on the podcast of the same name.</td>
      <td>Early in “The Shrink Next Door” (begins Friday with three episodes, Apple TV+)—a richly beguiling tale of near impenetrable darkness—we learn how its hapless central subject, Marty Markowitz (Will Ferrell), became entangled in the life of Isaac Herschkopf (Paul Rudd), psychotherapist. It’s a story—based on a 2019 nonfiction podcast by business journalist Joe Nocera—begun in the Manhattan of the early 1980s, whose effects would endure for decades to come. Here is where we find the young Marty, who sits nervously at the helm of the successful fabric company left to him by his recently deceased parents. He is having no easy time of it, as is clear in one wonderfully atmospheric scene in which a longtime customer rages on about unwanted linings in the drapes he ordered and, certain that he’s about to be cheated by Marty, demands to see Jerome instead. That’s Uncle Jerome, an old manager of the firm but one no longer available. That’s because he’s now busy filing a lawsuit against the family company.<br />He can’t see Jerome, it’s explained to the customer. He’ll be taking his business elsewhere then, the man informs Marty’s sister Phyllis (a superb Kathryn Hahn), a woman not easily threatened—one who assures the departing patron that they’ll miss him, with all the pointed indifference at her command. Phyllis has more urgent matters on her mind—not least that morning’s spectacle of her anguished brother literally chewing on the drapery as he lay curled up behind a curtain to avoid further conversation with the customer. Marty was, she saw, in the throes of a panic attack, a kind he’s had before. A good reason, she informs him, to at last agree to visit a psychotherapist. Dr. Herschkopf, is, she assures her brother, not some nobody—he came highly recommended by their rabbi.</td>

A daydreamer, a talented linguist and a lover of poetry and plays, the young Maximilian was torn between his bone-deep reverence for the House of Habsburg and his genuine sympathy for the liberal political reforms that were sweeping Europe. This second son was prone to restlessness and melancholy, haunted by a conviction that he was destined for a greatness he could never fulfill.</td>

      <td>Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation just days before suspending habeas corpus—a paradox at the heart of his attempt to restore the Union to health.</td>
      <td>Two days after he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, in September 1862, Abraham Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus throughout the United States, subjecting all Americans to the threat of military arrest and indefinite imprisonment without trial.<br />These steps—one toward a “new birth of freedom,” the other toward a military dictatorship—are at the heart of Noah Feldman’s “The Broken Constitution: Lincoln, Slavery and the Refounding of America.” The Constitution itself became a casualty in the war Lincoln waged to defend it, Mr. Feldman argues. “Civil war is the very definition of a failed constitution,” he writes. As Lincoln came to terms with this fact, he transformed the war into a struggle to establish an entirely new constitution on the moral principle of liberty for all.</td>

      <td>Allied commanders banned women journalists from covering combat but couldn’t keep the most resourceful away.</td>
      <td>‘I am going to Spain with the boys,” Martha Gellhorn famously declared as she left with Ernest Hemingway to write about the Spanish Civil War. “I don’t know who the boys are but I am going with them.” But being with the boys was precisely what neither she, nor her fellow women correspondents, could achieve once World War II broke out and Allied military leaders banned women from front-line reporting. Their presence, they were told, would be disruptive and embarrassing for the soldiers, and the question of their “conveniences” was too delicate even to contemplate. Blocked, corralled, marginalized at every turn, the six women who form the focus of Judith Mackrell’s “The Correspondents” nonetheless wheedled and charmed their way to where the action was. When that failed, they disobeyed orders, dodged their minders and pushed on regardless.<br />They were a formidable bunch. Bold to the point of recklessness, resourceful, inquisitive, crusading and utterly determined, they brought to their dispatches a sense of moral outrage, often to a greater degree than their male colleagues, about the war itself and the destruction it caused. Civilian casualties, bombed-out houses, separated families and the suffering of the injured all featured large in their writings. All six were good-looking, and used this fact when necessary. They had backbones of steel. They knew each other, but they preferred to hunt alone. Between them, working for different papers, they covered all the defining moments of the war.</td>

      <td>THE FIRST 18 MONTHS of the pandemic were especially productive for Mindy Kaling. “I was lucky I was pregnant for a big chunk of it,” said the Los Angeles-based producer, actor, writer and mother of two. “Having a baby makes everyone seem productive.”<br />Ms. Kaling, 42, was equally prolific when it came to Hollywood output. “I’m a writer. I had no distractions. So, that’s what I did.” She produced a second season of her  Netflix  high-school hit “Never Have I Ever,” with a third on the way. Also in the pipeline are a comedy about the L.A. Lakers and a Scooby-Doo spinoff series following the sleuthy and scientific Hanna-Barbera character Velma. (She voices a character on the Disney+ animated series “Monsters at Work” and is slated to voice Velma, too.)</td>
