It also would have required Medicare and Medicaid waivers from the Trump Health and Human Services Department. Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon called the bill “woefully incomplete.”</td>

This week the U.S. will have a chance to send a different message to the Kremlin.<br />The opening is a deal between Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Ted Cruz. In exchange for ending Mr. Cruz’s blockade on 32 nominees, Mr. Schumer agreed to hold a vote by Jan. 14 on the Texas Senator’s Nord Stream 2 bill. The legislation would impose pipeline sanctions within 15 days, and a presidential move to lift or waive them would be subject to a Congressional vote.</td>

As one of the legislators who helped lead congressional reauthorization of the law in 1982 and 2005, I urge Congress to restore important provisions of the Voting Rights Act while rejecting efforts to eviscerate its protections for rank partisan gain.<br />The bipartisan history of the law affirms the foundational constitutional principles it protects. In 1965, the Senate approved the Voting Rights Act 77-19; the House 333-85. Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, John Lewis and other leaders of the civil-rights movement attended the bill signing.</td>

That’s good news, but here’s a risk that policy makers in every country should appreciate: Policies designed to slow the spread of Omicron may end up creating a supervariant that is more infectious, more virulent and more resistant to vaccines. That would be a man-made disaster.<br />To minimize that risk, policy makers must tolerate the rapid spread of milder variants. This will require difficult trade-offs, but it will save lives in the long run. We should end mask mandates and social distancing in most settings not because they don’t slow the spread—the usual argument against such measures—but because they probably do.</td>

Though it has received little attention, the case draws back the curtain on how race is being used to discriminate against Asian-Americans. In so doing it also underscores what is at stake in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, an appeal of which the Supreme Court is considering whether to hear.<br />The allegation in both cases is the same: The schools want fewer Asian-Americans so they can make room for black, Latino and white applicants who are less qualified on the merits. Before the change, Thomas Jefferson was about 70% Asian-American. The big difference is that Thomas Jefferson is a public school and Harvard is private.</td>

      <td>How authorities on both sides of the Atlantic thwarted an al Qaeda cell’s attempt to down multiple airliners with liquid explosives.</td>
      <td>Many failings of the post-9/11 security structure are rightly under scrutiny. After 20 years, almost 2,500 servicemen and -women killed, and $2.3 trillion spent, Afghanistan is once again under the control of the Taliban. America’s invasion of Iraq distracted the U.S. from more pressing threats and paved the way for a bolstered Iran and radical Sunni groups like ISIS. And yet, despite the obvious failures, there hasn’t been another terrorist attack on a similarly large scale. Why is that? Our security apparatus has clearly done something right.<br />Perhaps the most spectacular success in preventing another attack was a joint operation, in the mid-2000s, against a plot to down seven airliners as they traveled from London’s Heathrow Airport to destinations in the U.S. and Canada. The race to thwart the attack is well documented in “Disruption” by Aki J. Peritz, a former CIA analyst. The Overt plot, as it was known to security officials, was planned by an al Qaeda cell operating in the Walthamstow neighborhood of London and the town of High Wycombe outside the city. For those tasked with keeping the homelands safe on both sides of the Atlantic, it was either a near miss or a great triumph, depending on how one chooses to look at it.</td>

America’s current fetish for agreement with Berlin and Paris, rather than transactional diplomacy, means that on issue after issue the Germans and French can insist on their own policy views in exchange for consensus. For countries that don’t view Russia’s military buildup with sufficient alarm, consensus means words rather than action. The European Union has failed to draft sanctions on Russia even as the crisis enters its third month.

      <td>Regarding Jeffrey Shapiro’s op-ed “Stop Calling Jan. 6 an ‘Insurrection’” (Jan. 6): I was first made aware of the word “insurrection” as a teenager in 1965, when it was used widely in media to characterize the Watts riot in Los Angeles. No one argued with the word choice. It was true.<br />Years later, as a newspaper editor, I knew differences in denotation and connotation. A word in reasonable and general use might not apply in legal technicality. We might describe a backbenchers’ move on House leadership as an “insurgency.” In editorials, I sometimes decried taxation as “theft.”</td>

While it is true that Covid-related demand has far outstripped ocean capacity, that does not mean the FMC has ruled that “nefarious” acts on the part of shipping lines have played no role. In fact, the FMC is pursuing enforcement investigations involving three ocean carriers.<br />This is in addition to other actions taken in response to escalating shipping costs, such as investigating carrier-added fees and surcharges, auditing compliance with the rule on detention and demurrage and adjudicating complaints brought by shippers.</td>

      <td>Regarding Devorah Goldman’s op-ed “The Doctor’s Office Becomes an Assembly Line” (Dec. 30): The main issue in the decline of private doctors’ offices is the imposition of price controls. Since the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) instituted an arbitrary formula called RBRVS for establishing the value of physicians’ services, prices have been rigidly controlled.<br />With CMS, doctors by law may not charge more than Medicare and Medicaid allows. Pay for doctors’ services in independent offices have been held down, forcing doctors to sell out to hospitals. Private carriers pay doctors more than CMS, but they enforce de facto price controls by following RBRVS and making take-it-or-leave-it provider contracts with doctors.</td>

So when he was working as an executive producer and director on “The Wonder Years,” the recent ABC reboot of the classic coming-of-age show in which he starred in the 1980s, he wanted the characters to wear watches authentic to the series’s 1960s setting. For that he turned to his friend Eric Wind, a former senior watch specialist at Christie’s and now an independent watch dealer in Palm Beach, Fla.<br />Mr. Wind primarily peddles rare Rolex and Patek Philippe watches to private collectors, but in recent years, he’s carved out a niche facilitating watch loans for movies and TV shows including “Crazy Rich Asians” and FX’s “The Premise”—a key player in a subculture that fixates on the intersection between horology and pop-culture and has ripple effects for watch marketing, watch blogs and watch collectors.</td>

      <td>He cries ‘gouging’ as they face higher costs for labor, fuel and feed.</td>
      <td>President Biden has found a scapegoat for rising inflation: the meat industry. Mr. Biden claimed last week that meatpackers—who handle the processing, packaging and distribution of meat raised by farmers and ranchers—are price-gouging, driving a surge in consumer prices for beef, chicken and pork. As they say in cowboy country, Mr. Biden’s claim is all hat and no cattle. Unable or unwilling to acknowledge the problems actually driving inflation, Mr. Biden is proposing solutions based on the same failed policies that got us into this inflationary mess in the first place.<br />Meat prices are surging because the meat industry, like virtually every other industry, is facing dramatically higher input and labor costs. This isn’t a secret. Start with feed costs, which are at historic highs. As the Journal reported on Dec. 27, feed costs skyrocketed in 2021 and are expected to be volatile this year. This makes it more expensive to raise livestock, which in turn creates higher costs for meat.</td>

Kazakhstan is a Kremlin problem where “America has no real leverage,” as Politico put this instant conventional wisdom.

      <td>‘The Republican Party has radicalized against democracy.’</td>
      <td>Your editorial criticizing Senate Democrats’ efforts to protect Americans’ right to vote empowers those who sought on Jan. 6, 2021, to overturn the results of a free and fair election (“Schumer’s Filibuster Stunt,” Review & Outlook, Jan. 4).<br />In the wake of former President Trump’s Big Lie, the Republican Party has radicalized against democracy. Nineteen states have passed 33 laws to make it harder to vote. Election workers have endured violent threats over the past year simply for doing their jobs. These are not isolated developments. They are born of the same antidemocratic poison of last year’s deadly insurrection, and they urgently require the Senate to pass legislation.</td>

      <td>What do all those years add up to for a career politician?</td>
      <td>Regarding William McGurn’s column “Sen. Biden’s Shrinking Presidency” (Main Street, Dec. 28): I was reminded of an old joke at a bank I once worked for, that our management training program consisted of having the new hire “sit with Jones; he has 30 years of experience.” The problem was that Jones didn’t have 30 years of experience, but one year of experience 30 times. The same can be said of President Biden and virtually all career politicians.<br />Jerry Molitor</td>

      <td>Regulators do well to protect pilots and passengers from interference.</td>
      <td>Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Federal Aviation Administrator Stephen Dickson are rightly defending U.S. leadership in aviation safety—and protecting passengers and shippers—by insisting that telecom companies ensure safety before launching new 5G service that could damage pilots’ ability to navigate airliners (“Buttigieg’s FAA and 5G Mid-Air Collision,” Review & Outlook, Jan. 4).<br />New AT&T and Verizon service could create interference known to cause the radio altimeters—which tell pilots how far planes are above the ground—to provide faulty data or even stop working. For years, pilots urged the wireless industry to collaborate to ensure safety, but until the Transportation Department and FAA intervened, the industry dismissed our concerns.</td>
