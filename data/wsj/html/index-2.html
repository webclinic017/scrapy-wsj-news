The plan will help the state economy—all the more if legislators keep their pledge to follow up with additional cuts.<br />State legislative leaders agreed Saturday to an income-tax cut that will give Mississippi the nation’s fifth-lowest top rate (for states with an income tax). The plan would reduce the highest rate to 4% in stages from 5% by 2026, and eliminate a current 4% rate that applies to taxable income between $5,000 and $10,000. The state House and Senate passed the tax bill on Sunday, and it now awaits Gov. Tate Reeves’s signature.</td>

And someone should say that Mr. Biden’s unscripted remark did have the virtue of telling the truth that the problem in Russia won’t end even if Mr. Putin orders his troops out of Ukraine.<br />Mr. Biden’s remark, even after its repudiation on Sunday by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, may well make it harder to negotiate with Mr. Putin over Ukraine or anything else. And Mr. Biden’s habit of misstating his own policies—no fewer than three times during his European trip—is especially dangerous amid an international crisis.</td>

The funds go chiefly to state agencies, which award the money to charters, and to nonprofit charter management organizations. The federal Department of Education recently proposed new rules that would discourage charters from even applying for grants—which may be the goal.</td>

      <td>The former chief economist at Uber has sound advice for innovators who, after modest success with an idea or product, would ‘go big’ with it.</td>
      <td>John List’s “The Voltage Effect” is marketed as a generic business title on how and whether to scale up an idea or product. Mr. List, an economics professor at the University of Chicago, explores why some ideas attain “voltage” and catch fire while others die out. This angle suggests that it will be another book about how to turn that great invention in your garage into the next Hewlett-Packard. But Mr. List is far too thoughtful to write something gimmicky or simple.<br />Scaling up can mean taking a product that appeals to a niche, local market and making it commercially viable to the masses. It can also apply to a belief or set of values, or a policy aimed at a small group of people that has the potential to work on a wider level. Mr. List has run many small-scale policy experiments, in particular with education. He knows that what makes a small charter school in the Chicago area succeed doesn’t always work when taken nationally. He also knows what products can scale—he was the chief economist at Uber and Lyft and has consulted with major corporations.</td>

Xi Jinping’s partner faces both unexpectedly fierce resistance from the Ukrainian military and surprisingly strong Western punishment. Some in Washington expect China to attempt to extricate itself by brokering a peace deal. This is unlikely to happen. In many ways China has benefitted from the conflict, as Russia tests the international system with disappointing results for the West.<br />True, Beijing is taken aback by Russian military failures. The war will surely lead Mr. Xi to question his military’s ability to attack Taiwan. Yet Mr. Xi has long heralded a new era in international relations that overturns the U.S.-made world order. Mr. Putin signed on to this agenda in the Chinese-Russian Joint Statement of Feb. 4. From Beijing’s perspective, a new international politics is emerging.</td>

      <td>Georgia, Moldova and Azerbaijan, which endured Russian coercion for years, are cautionary tales.</td>
      <td>Russia’s war against Ukraine is failing. But serious dangers remain. Among them are “peace” terms that, like those Russia imposed on past victims of its aggression, would set up Ukraine—and others—for bloodshed in the years to come. Vladimir Putin, who didn’t bargain on a tough fight, is likely to propose terms that look like concessions but are calculated to hobble Ukraine and threaten security far beyond its borders. Ukrainians won’t accept such an endgame, and other countries should not try to get them to do so.<br />Russia’s recent wars illustrate what Mr. Putin likely has in mind for Ukraine. In Georgia, which he invaded in 2008; in Moldova, where Russian troops never left; and in Azerbaijan, where Russia supported Armenian separatists in the early 1990s, fighting subsided but ambiguity followed. Russia’s proxies—a mix of puppets and Kremlin thugs—proceeded to dig in behind semiofficial armistice lines. With Russia’s support, fiefs under these proxies in some cases have lasted to the present day.</td>

      <td>Republicans need to show voters they have a viable alternative.</td>
      <td>After Sen. John McCain’s thumbs-down vote doomed Republican efforts to repeal ObamaCare in 2017, the party’s leadership largely abandoned the effort and shifted to other topics. Congress zeroed out the individual-mandate penalty as part of its tax-cut legislation; Republican attorneys general tried unsuccessfully to use that action to convince the courts to repeal the law; President Trump promised to replace ObamaCare with a better plan. Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy offered their own plan, but Republican leaders never brought it to the floor and seemed happier to forget the entire healthcare topic.<br />Republicans need to be better prepared the next time they control both chambers of Congress and the White House. President Biden’s sinking poll numbers and Democratic infighting may give them that opportunity in three years. To avoid another failure at repealing ObamaCare, Republicans need to convince voters that they have a viable replacement.</td>

But overall the college is now engaged in constructive, if also unsettling, discussions. The message of the protesters has finally been heard.</td>

First, in the way of Washington insiders, she assumes there is a right side of history. Not so. History has no moral component. It is written by the winners.<br />Second, Ms. Noonan asserts that we must be guided above all else by a strategy that avoids provoking Vladimir Putin to use his most terrible weapons—the “avoid Armageddon at all costs” strategy. We certainly want to avoid Armageddon, but how best to achieve that? I submit that projecting fear of an opponent is seldom, if ever, the best way to avoid the consequences we fear. Mr. Putin has every bit as much to fear from us as we do from him. At least in private, we should assure Mr. Putin that his use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons in Ukraine would cross a red line that would provoke us to respond militarily. And unlike former President Barack Obama, we must mean it.</td>

We don’t need the government to try to fool us. Clocks are supposed to tell the time.

      <td>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has upended geopolitics and, for many in the West, provoked moral righteousness. For investors who prided themselves on trying to do the right thing with their money, it has revealed fundamental flaws in the booming business of environmental, social and governance investing, known by the acronym ESG.<br />Here’s the problem: ESG is trying to gauge the sensitivity of companies to the public mood, either for moral reasons or because the public matter as customers, suppliers and employees of the companies. But the public mood keeps changing, and what counted as the right thing to do before Russia invaded has suddenly switched.</td>

The plan would generate roughly $360 billion in revenue over 10 years, according to a White House fact sheet released in advance of Monday’s full budget proposal. That is about twice as much money as raising the top individual income-tax rate to 39.6% from 37%, and it would affect a much smaller group of people.</td>

      <td>Today’s adolescents are the most sleep-deprived population in human history, but parents and schools can help them get the rest they need.</td>
      <td>The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated a decades-long trend of adolescents getting less sleep. A study of undergraduates at the University of Colorado, Boulder, found that when stay-at-home orders went into effect in March 2020, students’ sleep initially increased by an average of 30 minutes a night. But as the year went on, a combination of anxiety, heavy technology use and spending a lot of time in their bedrooms led to less sleep for many teens. A survey conducted by the nonprofit Challenge Success found that in the fall of 2020, the average 12th-grader was sleeping only 6.4 hours per night.<br />Teen sleep is now a scarce resource. A study of middle and high schoolers in the 1990s found their average sleep time was 7.53 hours, which is less than optimal but near adequate levels. By 2006, that number had dwindled by half an hour. An analysis of 270,000 middle and high schoolers found that between 1996 and 2012 there was a significant rise in the percentage of teens who slept less than seven hours per night, with the greatest drop-off in sleep time occurring among 15-year-olds. By age 15, most kids go to bed later than their parents and share a pillow with their phones. Many parents of teenagers have no idea what time their child goes to bed or how much they actually sleep.</td>

Now, he is crafting a formal plan to try to keep lawmakers united and voters engaged.<br />At House Republicans’ policy retreat at a resort near Jacksonville, the minority leader and other party officials previewed policies they plan to pursue as well as investigations they may launch into people close to President Biden. Mr. McCarthy hopes that a formal agenda—which Republicans spent several days drafting in group discussions—will boost midterm turnout and tamp down any revolts in the ideologically-diverse caucus.</td>

Matthew Eberhart, VP of marketing at resale platform Grailed, says yes—provided you “don’t get ketchup stains or rips on your clothes.” While you’ll occasionally see Birkin-level returns on items like a vintage Raf Simons bomber jacket, Mr. Eberhart said most of his customers look at resale as “a conduit to an endless closet” and sell past purchases they’ve literally or stylistically outgrown in order to fund a refreshed wardrobe.<br />Being a smart reseller means knowing when to sell—and when not to. Sasha Skoda, head of women’s at consignment platform the  RealReal ,  noted that party dresses are selling well. “People are wanting to get back out there, make big statements and have a lot of fun,” she said. Similarly, Sofia Bernardin, founder of luxury vintage and second-hand platform Re-See, has observed demand for slinky, 2000s-era Tom Ford and John Galliano dresses. Also worth selling right now? Vivienne Westwood corsets, vintage Jean Paul Gaultier and pretty much anything that embodies Y2K or “Euphoria” style.</td>

It must at the very least (given the failure of high schools) provide the educational foundation—literacy, numeracy, civics, critical thinking—for adulthood, a meaningful career and responsible citizenship.<br />I wish the Bragdon kids success, but if all they get out of college is a lucrative job, they will have wasted more than their parents’ money.</td>

Recently released archival documents demonstrate how American officials, adamant about the country’s denuclearization, ignored the sentiments of Ukraine’s postcommunist leaders, who were desperate to secure their new country.<br />Vladimir Putin’s carnage in Ukraine and threats of nuclear escalation cast a haunting shadow over the Budapest Memorandum, the accord that occasioned Mr. Kravchuk’s remorse. By its terms, Ukraine forfeited an inherited Soviet nuclear arsenal in exchange for Western pledges of aid and “assurances” from Russia, the U.S. and the U.K. that its borders would remain intact. Disarmament experts hailed the pact, but it invited Mr. Putin’s revanchism.</td>

David Berger, the current commandant. Among Marines there are serious questions about the wisdom and long-term risk of dramatic reductions in force structure, weapon systems and manpower levels in units that would take steady casualties in most combat scenarios. And it is unclear to just about everyone with experience in military planning what formal review and coordination was required before Gen. Berger unilaterally announced a policy that would alter so many time-honored contributions of the Marine Corps.</td>

The catalogs of major book publishers were awash with titles like “How Democracies Die” and “Democracy in Chains,” and the Washington Post gave itself the strange slogan “Democracy dies in darkness.”<br />It was all disorienting to Americans—the great majority, I suspect—who understand the word in its ordinary procedural sense. Democracy, in this planer sense, is about fair elections, rules-based campaigns, policy making by the winners of those elections, and constitutional limits on their power.

      <td>Nearly 80 years have passed since the end of World War II, but popular and scholarly interest in history’s deadliest conflict shows no sign of abating. Studies of the war roll off the presses at a rapid rate; films, documentaries and podcasts on the subject attract large audiences. For most people, tales of shattered cities, desperate refugees and heroic resistance have long had the added benefits of distance and remoteness, becoming mere reminders of a vanished age.<br />But the shadow of war has again fallen across Europe, as a large and powerful state has gone to war against its smaller neighbor with the aim of conquest, in a manner not seen on the Continent since the 1940s. Ukraine, part of what the historian Timothy Snyder calls the “bloodlands” crushed between the tyrannies of Hitler’s Germany and Stalin’s Soviet Union, is again being savaged. Its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, with his physical courage and rhetorical prowess, has evoked comparisons with Britain’s wartime leader, Winston Churchill. And Russian leader Vladimir Putin, determined to maintain his kleptocratic rule, has pledged to carve up Ukraine and restore Russian imperial glory.</td>
