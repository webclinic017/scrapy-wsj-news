      <td>The press is saying President Biden blundered Monday in committing the U.S. to defend Taiwan, but after three similar statements in the last year maybe he means it. The arguably much bigger mistake is his decision not to include Taiwan in the new Indo-Pacific Economic Framework that the Administration launched on Monday.<br />Asked by a reporter if the U.S. would defend Taiwan militarily against China, Mr. Biden answered with a blunt “yes.” He went on to say that, “We agree with the One China policy. We signed onto it and all the attendant agreements made from there. But the idea that it could be taken by force, just taken by force, is just not—it’s just not appropriate. It will dislocate the entire region and be another action similar to what happened in Ukraine.”</td>

Pennsylvania’s sluggish processing of absentee ballots is bad enough, but every time the margin narrows, it raises the odds that this will turn into a larger mail-vote fiasco.<br />As of Monday, plenty of ballots were up in the air, including 2,000 provisional votes from both parties in Allegheny County. That’s a stronghold for Mr. Oz’s rival, David McCormick. The two sides are also jockeying over mail ballots that voters neglected to date. Mr. McCormick wants them counted, since he’s winning 32% of mail votes statewide, versus 23% for Mr. Oz, who is urging the opposite.</td>

Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the script has flipped. Critics of Justice Samuel Alito’s leaked draft opinion charge that overturning Roe would condemn other precedents: Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), establishing the right to contraception; Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), the right to same-sex marriage; even Loving v. Virginia (1967), the right to marry regardless of race.</td>

For saying so, the Heritage Foundation was accused by some on the right of abandoning conservative principles or embracing populist isolationism. Neither charge is true. But in one sense, both are welcome.<br />The war in Ukraine may finally force conservatives into the intramural foreign policy debate they have put off for more than 30 years. Heritage is committed to President Ronald Reagan’s belief in “peace through strength.” Today, conservatives differ over how to apply that maxim. Washington elites say we are divided into reckless neoconservatives and naive isolationists. In fact, conservative-minded Americans fall somewhere in between those two camps. But where most elected conservatives stand on the spectrum isn’t clear. The vote in Congress wasn’t for or against support of Ukraine. It was for or against an unpaid-for, unamendable, take-it-or-leave-it $40 billion omnibus proposal cobbled together outside the committee process.</td>

Wisconsin’s Kiel Area School District, in deep red Manitowoc and Calumet counties along the western shore of Lake Michigan, has uncovered a new form of harassment.

The encouraging findings from a new Mason-Dixon poll suggest that U.S. registered voters—including a large majority of independents—want the Court to continue under its current structure, but without any more leaks of draft opinions.<br />The survey of 1,100 registered voters was commissioned by the First Liberty Institute and conducted from May 13 through May 18. This column will offer the usual disclaimer that public opinion polling is not an exact science, if it’s even a science.

Mr. Oaks writes that S&P’s ESG metrics, which determine credit ratings for state and local governments, are tilted against places that produce natural gas and oil—jeopardizing U.S. energy leadership when it’s most desired.<br />It’s misguided to deploy metrics that undervalue our industry’s progress and infringe on the role of markets to determine America’s best energy path. Supply and demand have been driven lately by Russian aggression and the reaction to the pandemic. How companies and governments react isn’t tied to any one metric.</td>

A feast could be coming its way.<br />In normal times, such shops source their inventory through two broad buckets. About three-quarters is sourced through merchandise that local stores unload for a bargain (think of stores going out of business or piles of unsold clothes at the end of a season), while one-quarter is ordered directly from vendors and factories (primarily in Asia), according to estimates from Michael Binetti, equity analyst at Credit Suisse. Last year’s abnormally tight inventory situation flipped that ratio. In a research report, Credit Suisse estimated that so-called direct buy from factories or vendors accounted for as much as 75% of off-price inventory last year.</td>

The separation of powers has since dissolved to a point that would have dismayed the Framers—and should worry all Americans.<br />Now the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has taken what could be a historic step toward restoring the Constitution’s checks and balances, in the case of Jarkesy v. SEC. The Securities and Exchange Commission acts as rulemaker, prosecutor and judge for America’s securities laws.

In 1975 France liberalized its treatment of abortion and today has superficial restrictions after 14 weeks of pregnancy. Ireland was the last to legalize it, by referendum in 2018.

      <td>I agree with Akhil Reed Amar’s constitutional assessment of Justice Samuel Alito’s opinion on abortion and Roe v. Wade (“The End of Roe v. Wade,” Review, May 14). I agree with him that Justice Harry Blackmun’s opinion in Roe was a poorly written and poorly justified decision. I also agree with him on a woman’s right to decide.<br />Where we differ is when he claims that rights like same-sex and interracial marriage are inherently historical rights. Although I support these rights, they are by no means inherently historical. Neither is the right to an abortion. It is a modern right. But if you take it away, following Justice Alito’s and Prof. Amar’s reasoning, then all our modern rights have to go, or the Supreme Court loses any credibility it might have left.</td>

Making foie gras requires a force-feeding process, which causes liver expansion similar to what wild ducks undergo before migration but on a greater scale. Messrs. Henley and Saravia feed their birds a gradually increasing liquid diet through a 6-inch rubber tube about half an inch wide.

I was struck that such a standard would preclude reading many outstanding literary works. The “Iliad,” “Macbeth,” “The Trial” and “1984” come immediately to mind. If literature can cause nightmares, so can history. “History is a nightmare from which I’m trying to awake,” Stephen Dedalus famously says in James Joyce’s “Ulysses.” “Ulysses” was published in 1922, four years after World War I ended.<br />It’s true that becoming educated means learning about, in the words of Matthew Arnold, “the best which has been thought and said.” It also requires learning about the dark passions that drive human beings. Young children shouldn’t be required to read disturbing literary or historical material, but it is important that older students learn what our world is really like.</td>

David Perdue into challenging Mr. Kemp last year, and then handed him his “complete and total endorsement.” Mr. Perdue, who lost a January 2021 runoff to Democrat Jon Ossoff, has run a straight-up “stop the steal” campaign, saying at a March Trump rally: “Let me be very clear. Very clear. In the state of Georgia, thanks to Brian Kemp, our elections were absolutely stolen. He sold us out.”</td>

      <td>The politicians tacitly admit that their policies are responsible.</td>
      <td>Politicians are scrambling to pacify mothers angry about the baby formula shortage, but the one thing they won’t do is look in the mirror. Fixing the shortage requires fixing the government policies that helped to create it.<br />The shortage began after  Abbott Laboratories  shut down a plant in Michigan after four infants who consumed formula made at the facility fell seriously ill. Abbott controls about 42% of the U.S. market, and the other three large manufacturers (Perrigo,  Nestle  and Mead Johnson) haven’t been able to increase production fast enough to compensate. Ergo, empty shelves.</td>

      <td>Why aid the struggling anti-American regime in Havana now?</td>
      <td>Whatever the humanitarian impulse behind the Biden Administration’s Monday announcement that it will lift some sanctions on Cuba, the timing couldn’t be worse. The dictatorship is under stress, and it remains Russia’s closest ally in the Western Hemisphere. Why would Team Biden take the pressure off Havana now?<br />Cuba’s regime may be in the most precarious state of its 63 years in power. The economy has collapsed, and hero worship of Fidel Castro is as dead as he is. The July 11 uprising last year, when tens of thousands went to the streets and shouted for freedom, exposed the contempt Cubans have for their government.</td>

      <td>Beijing seeks to exclude the island nation, despite U.S. objections.</td>
      <td>Harsh lockdowns in Shanghai and elsewhere in China have ended illusions that the Communist Party has managed the Covid-19 pandemic well. Yet Beijing is still trying to run the World Health Organization.<br />The World Health Assembly, the WHO’s decision-making body, will hold its 75th annual meeting in Geneva on May 22-28. Beijing has prevented Taiwan from attending the assembly since 2017, and it now seeks to exclude it for another year. China doesn’t recognize Taiwan’s legitimacy and works to bar the island democracy from any global forum.</td>

      <td>States, and maybe soon Congress, are resisting the ESG demands of index funds run by BlackRock.</td>
      <td>Passive investing through index funds lets ordinary Americans own the market. Those funds and similar vehicles spread risk and keep fees low. The resulting rates of return have triggered seismic shifts from active to passive funds.<br />The problem is that there’s been an equally seismic power shift to those passive funds’ investment managers. They’re trying to remake corporate America to suit their personal politics.</td>
