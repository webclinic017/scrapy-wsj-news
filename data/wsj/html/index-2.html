One consequence is that sparsely populated island nations in the Pacific Ocean are getting heightened attention from the U.S. and its allies. The latest example is a joint investment by the U.S., Japan and Australia in an undersea cable connecting the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Kiribati and Nauru.<br />The State Department’s Saturday press release headline, “Joint Statement On Improving East Micronesia Telecommunications Activity,” may not suggest a geopolitical watershed. The countries receiving the investment have a combined population not much greater than that of Boise, Idaho, and a GDP many times lower. But they encompass 641 islands among them (mostly belonging to the FSM) in the same crucial oceanic neighborhood as U.S. bases in Guam, Hawaii and Australia.</td>

CFPB data show that only 9% of consumers are responsible for 80% of overdraft fees. What’s more, CFPB regulation requires financial institutions to obtain a consumer’s express opt-in to overdraft protection.</td>

      <td>Mayor-elect Eric Adams makes a promising choice to run New York City’s public education system.</td>
      <td>New York’s departing mayor, Bill de Blasio, has spent eight years at loggerheads with law enforcement and school reformers. When he wasn’t siding with Black Lives Matter demonstrators at antipolice protests, the mayor was busy thwarting the expansion of high-performing charter schools, attacking gifted-and-talented middle-school programs and denouncing public high schools that admit students based on a standardized test score.<br />This was all done in the name of racial equity, but New Yorkers apparently have tired of wokeness-driven governance. Last month, voters opted to replace Mr. de Blasio with a former police officer, Eric Adams, who in turn has tapped education innovator David Banks to be the city’s next schools chancellor. Mr. Banks is a former teacher and principal who founded the six-school Eagle Academy network, which serves low-income black and Hispanic boys in New York City and Newark, N.J. Eagle Academy is a network of public schools that, like charter schools, operates mostly outside the strictures of the traditional public-school system, which Mr. Banks believes has long ill-served minority communities.</td>

It’s about a run-of-the-mill shooting, nothing like the horrific crimes Mr. Daly portrays elsewhere in his paean to the New York Police Department. But it took place in a seemingly safe space: a Vera Wang bridal shop on Manhattan’s Upper East Side in early 1994. Two men robbed an out-of-town couple shopping with their daughters; one of the robbers then shot the couple with a semiautomatic pistol.<br />After the parents were taken to the hospital, one of their daughters shouted: “I hate this city!” The couple survived, but the young woman’s sentiment expressed the frustration of New Yorkers who had grown weary of the everyday violence of their city—a place where nearly 2,000 people were murdered every year—and couldn’t understand why their political leaders seemed powerless to do anything about it.</td>

It reunites the six scenes of the loves, whims and vengeance of the gods—derived from Ovid’s “Metamorphoses,” enacted by voluptuous nudes—that Titian painted for Philip II of Spain between 1551 and 1562. Most exciting is the last of the series, the Gardner’s glorious, newly cleaned “Rape of Europa” (1559-62), the terrified heroine precariously sprawled on the back of Zeus, who is disguised as a white bull. Its radiant color, bravura gestures and delicate depiction are hallmarks of Titian’s vigorous late style. It has been 400 years since the now widely dispersed masterworks were last together.

Her husband looks different. “I’ve lost weight,” he says from the driver’s seat. Where are his glasses? “I wear contacts now,” he tells her. “Are you having an affair?” she asks. He says no. “Am I having an affair?” she asks, thinking out loud. It certainly makes her amnesia convincing: It’s a question one would pose only if one really didn’t know.<br />What’s a little less believable is the catalog’s worth of life-altering, near-catastrophic events that have transpired during the months Jo now can’t recall. Some would be spoilers to reveal, but others are simply setups: Her dog has died. Her son, Finn (Tom Taylor), has dropped out of university. She hasn’t spoken to her best friend, Cathy (the terrific Susan Lynch), in months. Why? She’ll get answers from everyone; whether they’re true is questionable. So is the veracity, and behavior, of a woman whom the doctors have already advised will suffer paranoia, reduced inhibitions, nightmares and hallucinations. She also seems to be suffering short-term memory loss. (She can’t remember anyone’s name two minutes after being introduced, although that’s something with which a lot of us will sympathize.) “Plus the medication,” her husband adds, helpfully.</td>

Like The Industry’s “Sweet Land” (2020), a multi-collaborator project that explored colonialism, and last month’s Met premiere, Matthew Aucoin and Sarah Ruhl’s “Eurydice,” which told the Orpheus legend from Eurydice’s point of view, “Iphigenia” rewrites a familiar story.</td>

(They have increasingly aligned in their opposition to the U.S. and the post-Cold War international order.) The rising threat of high-intensity state-on-state war is driven by the growing elite conviction in Beijing and Moscow that their power disadvantage relative to the U.S. and its allies will worsen unless they move soon, making victory increasingly unattainable.</td>

DHS didn’t take several elements into account, including the program’s potential benefits, the court said, adding that the agency’s approach was contrary to federal immigration law.</td>

      <td>When the Roman writer Juvenal penned the adage “bread and circuses,” he warned emperors that they must conjure such distractions to pacify peasants into accepting lousy rulers. This should have President Biden worried—the price of bread in the U.S. has jumped 15% since the start of 2020, while a ticket to a modern-day circus, an NBA game, has climbed 37% since last season.<br />There’s real wisdom in the Roman cliché. Bread is a staple and its cost often reflects worldwide commodity prices. If it isn’t affordable, citizens throw fits and rocks. In 2007 hundreds of thousands from Mexico to Bangladesh to Italy rose in protest when prices of loaves, tortillas and pasta soared. But there’s another point of wisdom in the price of a circus. In our modern era, the cost of a night out doesn’t only say something about entertainment, but also the service sector—something to which the Federal Reserve and White House have not paid enough attention.</td>

The community showers were recently scrubbed of black mold—some of which remained.” The report adds that inmates said they “did not have access to their attorneys, families or proper nutrition.”</td>
