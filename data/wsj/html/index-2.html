Prominent party figures such as Diane Abbott and John McConnell, who served in the shadow cabinet under former leader Jeremy Corbyn, had put their names to a Stop the War Coalition statement blaming the British government and NATO for provoking Mr. Putin and “refut[ing] the idea that NATO is a defensive alliance.”</td>

A mere 15 years ago, countries in the European Union produced more gas than Russia exported. Yet European production has plunged by more than half over the last decade.

Various European countries allow the U.S. to house American nuclear weapons on their soil as part of NATO’s deterrence.

And what seems to be uniting a growing number of Americans today is opposition to a Democratic equity agenda that effectively plays racial and ethnic groups against one another.<br />The Supreme Court is poised to strike a blow for colorblind college admissions later this year when it considers a case involving alleged anti-Asian discrimination at Harvard. But the fight continues at the K-12 level as well. Two years ago, the school board in Fairfax County, Va., altered the admissions standards at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, one of the top-ranked public schools in the country. Among other things, standardized testing requirements were eliminated, and subjective admission criteria were added in an effort to deny slots to Asian-Americans and boost enrollment among blacks and Hispanics.</td>

This makes the grid more reliable and electricity prices more affordable and stable.

Wind was the only electricity source whose capacity factor declined during the cold weather. The capacity factor for coal increased more than any of the others. This doesn’t mean that wind is a bad source of electricity. Rather, these numbers show the value of having a mix of resources that includes coal.</td>

The American policy of peace through strength, market-driven economic growth, and open trade defeated the Soviet Union. The emerging conflict with China, excepting the military threat to Taiwan, will for the foreseeable future be almost entirely economic. That will make it unlike the military conflicts with the Soviet Union and its proxies in Eastern Europe, Korea, Vietnam, Cuba and countless global insurrections. If the U.S. maintains peace through strength, it can lose this struggle only by forfeiting the source of its economic success: economic freedom.<br />China is currently expanding government dominance of its economy and suffering a concomitant reduction in economic growth, tech-stock valuations and employment. If President Biden and Congress have their way, Chinese-style industrial and antitrust policies will soon come to the U.S. The America Competes Act is the House’s effort to outdo the Chinese Communist Party’s latest five-year plan. The 2,900-page bill would make an old Soviet commissar blush.

And yet, by the end of episode 1 of Hulu’s dramatic series “The Dropout,” a viewer will be wondering if the subject’s misbehavior is going to be blamed on her chilly mother, her feckless father, her own frigidity, mean girls, a sexual assault at Stanford, or the fact that she couldn’t run as fast as the other kids in grade school.<br />The eight-part series finally stops imposing sympathy on the story in episode 4, when Holmes (Amanda Seyfried) becomes a fully paranoid burner of bridges at Theranos, her “disruptive” company that was built on a blood-testing technology that never actually worked. She shops it anyway, to CVS, Safeway and ultimately Walgreens, whose team of older male executives—who should be running for the hills—partner instead with a woman willing to test her unworkable process on terminal cancer patients, spy on her employees and lie shamelessly in the face of incontrovertible facts. “I don’t feel things the way other people feel things,” she tells her age-inappropriate boyfriend and alleged accomplice, Sunny Balwani (a wondrously vile Naveen Andrews).

She’s interesting because, by every indication, she’s a sociopath. And yet, by the end of episode 1 of Hulu’s dramatic series “The Dropout,” a viewer will be wondering if the subject’s misbehavior is going to be blamed on her chilly mother, her feckless father, her own frigidity, mean girls, a sexual assault at Stanford, or the fact that she couldn’t run as fast as the other kids in grade school.<br />The eight-part series finally stops imposing sympathy on the story in episode 4, when Holmes (Amanda Seyfried) becomes a fully paranoid burner of bridges at Theranos, her “disruptive” company that was built on a blood-testing technology that never actually worked. She shops it anyway, to CVS, Safeway and ultimately Walgreens, whose team of older male executives—who should be running for the hills—partner instead with a woman willing to test her unworkable process on terminal cancer patients, spy on her employees and lie shamelessly in the face of incontrovertible facts. “I don’t feel things the way other people feel things,” she tells her age-inappropriate boyfriend and alleged accomplice, Sunny Balwani (a wondrously vile Naveen Andrews).

      <td>Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine has not yet reached its climax, but it has already shaken the foundations of world politics. In the past 72 hours, German and consequently European politics have been transformed. Berlin is openly sending arms to a country whose independence it has for decades refused to defend. Mr. Putin faces the greatest crisis of his career. Middle East oil producers are regaining the upper hand over the Biden administration as the war adds inflationary pressure to an overheated world economy. Powerful voices in Japan are openly discussing nuclear weapons even as Beijing reflects on the lessons of Mr. Putin’s war for Xi Jinping. The voluble American pro-Putin chorus has folded like a cheap suit.<br />The war on the ground continues to develop and it is at this point impossible to say how long or how brutal the war will be, much less how it will end. The U.S. intelligence community still believes that Russia’s greater military strength will ultimately prevail, but the uncertainties around that forecast have grown. A palace coup or a popular uprising in Russia could bring the war and Mr. Putin’s career to a quick end. Alternatively, Russian forces in Ukraine could adapt to the new situation and, perhaps with the kind of brutality Russian forces have brought to Chechnya and Syria, crush Ukrainian resistance as the world wrings its hands. The confrontation between the West and Russia could escalate toward an all-out cyberwar or the most dangerous nuclear standoff since the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. Western aid could help Ukraine fight Russia to a standoff, leading ultimately to a de facto partition and another frozen stalemate.</td>

Yet surprisingly little financial planning occurred in advance of the worst of times in America. The danger of violent secession had loomed for years, but neither North nor South entered the 1861 secession crisis positioned to fund prolonged armed conflict. (Only in 1865 did Abraham Lincoln explain that “neither party” had “expected . . . the “magnitude or the duration” of the war.) In “Ways and Means,” Mr. Lowenstein, a onetime reporter for this newspaper and the author of books on Warren Buffett and the Federal Reserve, makes what subsequently occurred at Treasury and on Wall Street during the early 1860s seem as enthralling as what transpired on the battlefield or at the White House.<br />At first, the economic challenges facing each side seemed daunting: How could the South survive economically once the federal naval blockade reduced its cotton exports to a trickle? How would the North assuage European nations that depended on cotton to feed their ravenous mills; how would it persuade conservative Democrats to invest in the preservation of a government dominated by Republicans; exactly who would pay to suppress the Rebellion?

      <td>He has behaved as if he’s blind to the true stakes and likely consequences of the conflict he sought.</td>
      <td>In his speech announcing the invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin referenced the United Nations charter, praised “the high values of human rights and freedoms,” and claimed his war represents the only “opportunity to protect Russia and our people.” This from a man regarded by many American commentators as an archrealist who makes hardheaded observations about the world as it is and cunningly employs power to reshape it according to Russia’s interests. In Mike Pompeo’s appraisal, the Russian president is a “very talented statesman” and “very shrewd.”<br />In reality, Mr. Putin’s latest war of aggression is motivated by a toxic mix of nostalgia and fantasy that seems likely to prove self-destructive. Mr. Putin has so far behaved like a man blind to the true stakes and probable consequences of this conflict. And the U.S., which is currently recovering from its own bout of military overreach, has the opportunity to revive a spirit of clear-eyed pragmatism that has been absent from major national security decisions in recent decades. If Mr. Putin’s actions are driven by an exaggerated view of his country’s power—and its insecurity—President Biden’s response must continue to be informed by a realistic appraisal of the ways the U.S. can (and can’t) defend its security interests and help the Ukrainian people.</td>

(One of those boys, now white-haired, recounts the find.) More than 30 years later, amateur historian Catherine Corless, looking into the history of the St. Mary’s Mother and Baby Home in Tuam (pronounced “tomb”) determined that the remains must have been of infants who had been under the care of the Bon Secours religious order, whose own records said that 796 children had died there between 1922 and 1961.</td>

Litigation tied up both a 2015 Obama-era initiative called the Clean Power Plan and a less-stringent Trump administration replacement, the Affordable Clean Energy Rule.
