More than a year later, we’re still getting information about the huge private money that underwrote official government voting efforts in 49 states. Much is still unknown, but lawmakers already know enough to ban this practice.<br />A nonprofit called the Center for Technology and Civic Life, or CTCL, funded by Mark Zuckerberg, says it gave $350 million to nearly 2,500 election departments in the course of the 2020 campaign. Last month it posted its 990 tax form for the period, with 199 pages listing grants to support the “safe administration” of voting amid Covid-19. Some conservatives see this largess of “Zuckerbucks” as a clever plot to help Democrats win.</td>

On Monday he announced that Democrats will revive their crusade to transform Congress by eliminating the Senate filibuster on the narrowest of partisan votes.<br />Mr. Schumer’s letter denounces the 60-vote rule for most legislation (which he’s made use of throughout his career) and says the Senate will “consider changes to Senate rules on or before January 17” for legislation to “protect the foundation of our democracy.”</td>

Believe it or not, the European Union is set to include nuclear and natural gas on the list of industries eligible for “green” investments. Someone please pass the smelling salts to the Sierra Club.<br />At issue is the so-called taxonomy for classifying environmentally sustainable investments. This new list is intended to create a uniform definition of activities that qualify as green for corporate disclosures, climate-oriented investing, and carbon-related government spending. The Brussels green list represents the largest regulatory effort to date to pin down what “sustainable” means in relation to finance.</td>

      <td>The ‘equally worthy claim’ inexorably prompts further expansion, regardless of lawmakers’ initial limits.</td>
      <td>Sen. Joe Manchin’s emphatic “no” to the current version of Build Back Better put the bill on life support. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, having promised a Senate vote, now must try to maintain the bill’s progressive priorities—including a raft of new and expanded entitlement programs—while shrinking its cost to meet Mr. Manchin’s concerns. A revised bill would almost certainly attempt to disguise the cost of these entitlements by making them initially less-generous. Experience teaches that no matter how slimmed-down the initial provision, an entitlement’s costs grow inexorably over time.<br />The history of U.S. entitlements is a 230-year record of continuous expansion and  liberalization. The first major entitlement, Revolutionary War disability benefits, was initially restricted to members of the Continental Army and Navy who were injured in battle and survivors of those killed in wartime. Eligibility was then expanded, first to state militia soldiers, then to veterans whose disabilities were unrelated to wartime service, and eventually to virtually all people who served during the war regardless of disability.</td>

In a 1970 book, “Private Wealth and Public Education,” he, John Coons and William Clune introduced a vision for educational vouchers that would extend the Supreme Court’s guarantee of an abstract right to attend a K-12 school of one’s choosing, public or private, into the concrete capacity to do so.</td>

Diktats and coercion intended to serve the collective are antithetical to the long-held ethical foundation that informs the physician-patient relationship.<br />The authors do a great job demonstrating that allowing respect for autonomy has, at a minimum, equipoise with the authoritarian approach, if not superiority, when considering a range of measures of health and happiness.</td>

Waves off the U.S. coasts have theoretical energy potential equivalent to two-thirds of the nation’s 2020 electricity generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Better still, water is complementary to wind and sunshine, today’s established but volatile sources of renewable energy.

We marched on the Pentagon and occupied college administration buildings. In the 1970s we mellowed, listened to the Band and the Eagles, and read Charles Reich’s “The Greening of America.” In the 1980s we rebounded as yuppies. We became investment bankers and lawyers, and the women among us wore suits with padded shoulders. Thereafter we ascended to political power—not always wisely, truth be told. But our music had lyrics and melodies, and our protest songs took on real injustices. We cemented a civil-rights revolution for women and minorities and left a mark on all succeeding generations.</td>

But with the acceptance of generics, prescription drugs must earn virtually all their returns on new drugs before they go off patent and prices plummet amid generic competition.
