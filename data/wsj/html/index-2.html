      <td>TEL AVIV—Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is exploring the option of a plea deal in corruption charges against him, according to people familiar with the talks, in a move that could decide the political fate of Israel’s longest-serving leader and upend the country’s politics.<br />The trial has become one of the starkest symbols of the reversal of fortunes for Mr. Netanyahu, who led the country for 15 years until he failed to form a government last spring. Prosecutors say Mr. Netanyahu accepted expensive gifts from wealthy businessmen in exchange for official favors and offered two media executives regulatory and financial benefits in exchange for positive press coverage.</td>

I must have been 100 feet away, but I felt those little electric currents firing in the tips of my fingers, the internal buzz created only by the charisma of the kind of movie star who takes your breath away—the kind who stands, I can say without hyperbole, as the most important American movie actor of the 20th century.<br />For what it’s worth, I hardly ever approach celebrities. But this time was different. At the Academy Awards earlier that year, Poitier had been given an honorary Oscar “in recognition of his remarkable accomplishments as an artist and as a human being.” In his speech, Poitier, who died this month at 94, remarked on the uncharted path he had followed since arriving in Hollywood in 1949 as a 22-year-old Bahamian-American, brand new to the movies.</td>

      <td>VIDEOS OF Gen Z-ers and millennials—and their cats—may saturate TikTok, but spend enough time scrolling around the social media app and you’ll find yourself led to more surprising realms. Take the travel feeds, which offer a stream of fresh footage shot just about anywhere in the world. Type #travel in the search box and you can watch waterfalls gush in Iceland, elk amble across Wyoming, sunsets unfold in South Tyrol or hungry turtles on the prowl in Zanzibar. Many of the videos are goofy vacation snippets, but in the past few years, TikTokers have matured a bit. Now some are eager to show off their hometowns, which lets armchair travelers dig deeper into destinations and get a personal perspective on a place. While some of these TikTok travel guides simply serve as inspiration for trip-planning, others offer real-life tours, too. Here, we highlight five of the most entertaining.<br />In Chicago, Sherman “Dilla” Thomas, 40, centers his TikTok videos on the city’s African-American history, exploring topics like redlining, segregation and gang culture. Calling himself Chicago’s favorite neighborhood historian, Mr. Thomas also delves into street names, local architecture, notable figures and the history of deep-dish pizza. A ComEd area operator and voracious reader, Mr. Thomas joined TikTok in November 2020, hoping to find an outlet for his local-history obsession. “I just have to get the stories out of me I guess,” he said. Last year, Mr. Thomas began offering occasional in-person tours, guiding visitors around historic neighborhoods such as Pullman and Bronzeville. His two-hour bus tours stop at places like the Pilgrim Baptist Church, which some consider the birthplace of gospel music, and the Eighth Regiment Armory, where Black soldiers were based during World War I.</td>

      <td>Thanks to the grandmillennial craze for vintage style and new fans like Nick Jonas and Bella Hadid, the brooch is improbably ascendant. But it’s not for everyone.</td>
      <td>At the top of the list of things I truly cannot imagine wearing is a brooch. Like a straw boater hat or a pair of suspenders, it feels like a fussy part of a costume for a regional theater production of “My Fair Lady.” And yet, in recent years, the brooch has been climbing out of the depths of dowdiness to become something more radical and contemporary. It’s no longer only for grandmas. Just ask Nick Jonas, the 29-year-old pop star who wore a large sparkling starfish pin on his lapel as a coach on “The Voice” in 2021. In an accompanying social-media clip, he proclaimed that he had “big brooch energy.”<br />As improbable as it sounds, “big brooch energy” has grown increasingly evident on the red carpet, the runway and across pop culture and social media. Brooches, also known as pins, evolved from their Bronze Age use as clothing fasteners to be mostly decorative. Today, some fans buy designer versions from pin-happy fashion brands like Loewe and Gucci, while others are collecting vintage brooches. Look! There’s Carrie Bradshaw in the “Sex and the City” reboot “And Just Like That…,” recycling her giant blue-flower pin from the original series. There’s Trevor Noah wearing a diamond starburst pin from Tiffany & Co. at the 2021 Grammy Awards. And there’s Bella Hadid with a Dior cactus brooch pinned to her halter top at a 2021 runway show.</td>

His company “actively supported China’s bid for Most Favored Nation trading status with the U.S.” and for membership in the World Trade Organization, his lawyers have noted, adding: “Scholars at the Council [on] Foreign Relations teased Jenevein about consistently seeing the best side of China. They were right.”<br />In legal filings, Mr. Jenevein claims his partners at a Chinese state-owned enterprise violated their contracts, poached his business, and tried to skirt the legal consequences when they got caught. “Investing in companies that the Communist Party controls or can control,” he says in an interview, “is a really bad idea.” Mr. Jenevein’s saga illustrates how the Communist Party and its state-owned enterprises use complicated networks of corporate entities to evade accountability for lawless behavior in the West and to move assets beyond the reach of the U.S. legal system.</td>

That may conceal much bigger increases for some households. Some 25 suppliers have failed since August, pushing thousands of businesses and some two million domestic customers (8% of all households) to new suppliers potentially at higher rates.</td>
