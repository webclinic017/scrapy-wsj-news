The federal government said it began taking steps after the three states didn’t adopt, at minimum, the federal Covid-19 safety plans for healthcare workers, which the Occupational Safety and Health Administration—a Labor Department subagency—released in June. The standard included requirements on masking, social distancing and paid leave for Covid-19 recovery, the federal government said.</td>

Many power plants in China are operating at a loss. Tough power consumption restrictions from local governments scrambling to meet carbon targets are another factor.</td>

      <td>The Justices shouldn’t be intimidated by an impotent commission.</td>
      <td>An early sign that President Biden would follow rather than lead his party was his refusal to repudiate “court-packing” in the 2020 campaign. As President he still had a chance to dismiss the idea as an exercise in constitutional arson. Instead, he appointed a commission to study packing the Supreme Court.<br />The commission is now completing its work as the Justices open a highly contested term with abortion and the Second Amendment on the docket. Its mere existence is a sign of Democratic ambitions to intimidate the Court. But the good news is that the project appears to be ending in disarray. While it may only whet the appetites of progressives over the long run, the Biden court-packing meltdown also signals that norms against political meddling in the judiciary remain intact—for now.</td>

Hypersonic missiles are harder to track and destroy than ballistic missiles and could evade U.S. missile defenses.</td>

His family said he died of complications from Covid-19, which still kills too many Americans too soon. But Powell’s extraordinary life is what the country should remember and celebrate.<br />Born in Harlem to immigrants from Jamaica, Powell went to City College when that institution had high standards and was still a path to upward mobility. He enrolled in the Army’s Reserve Officer Training Corps, which launched him on a distinguished military career. His service included combat tours in Vietnam, two Purple Hearts, and the Soldier’s Medal for returning to a crashed helicopter to rescue fellow soldiers.</td>

In the 2015 lawsuit, a group of activists said they were attacked by Mr. Trump’s security guards while protesting against his comments about immigrants on a sidewalk outside Trump Tower.</td>

I fell and have been partly disabled ever since. But I’ve made some good decisions too.<br />Perhaps the best decision was something I chose not to do—smoke cigarettes. Now that I’m 83, many of my contemporaries who were dedicated smokers are long gone. I think especially of the wonderful Bart Giamatti, who preceded me as Major League Baseball Commissioner and who once confessed sardonically that the only thing he did at a world-class level was smoke cigarettes. He smoked five packs a day and died at 51 of a heart attack.</td>

      <td>For the left, antiracism is the new religion, and ‘pious, unempirical virtue signaling’ is a form of political activism.</td>
      <td>‘This book frankly leapt out of me,” writes John McWhorter, “during the summer of 2020.” The country was convulsed not just with Covid-19, but with protests in response to the killing of an unarmed black man by a white policeman whose actions were caught on camera. Mr. McWhorter began to write in the first week of August. Eight weeks later, he’d finished “Woke Racism,” a book that hits back at the “antiracists” who prowl public life in search of transgression, and whose mission to rid America of “racist” thought he likens to that of a religious cult. His book is a cry from the heart, and readers should gauge the depth of his indignation from the fact that its working title was “F*** ’Em.”<br />This eloquent manifesto is Mr. McWhorter’s 22nd book, a majority of those on the subject of linguistics. His is a split personality: A linguist in his day job as a professor at Columbia University (specializing in creoles, particularly the Saramaccan language in Suriname), he’s also an outspoken commentator on race whenever the national mood requires it. As Mr. McWhorter’s thinking on race is in conflict with that of the black American political mainstream, he’s often miscast as a black conservative by glib taxonomists. But he’s careful to point out that he wasn’t “thinking of right-wing America as my audience,” even as he acknowledges that many liberal readers will think him “traitorous” for writing this book.</td>

It was an act of war directed at Sen. Joe Manchin, who Mr. Sanders notes is one of two Democrats standing in the way of the $3.5 trillion progressive wish list that is the stalled reconciliation bill. It didn’t help that Mr. Sanders characterized opponents as Republicans and others who “want to maintain the status quo in which the very rich get richer while ordinary Americans continue to struggle to make ends meet.” Presumably that includes Mr. Manchin.</td>

That assumption is that aggressively backing the transition from fossil fuels to renewables will strengthen the administration’s hand at home and abroad.<br />Bidenites think that climate offers an opportunity to pry Democratic greens and harder-left progressives apart. The deep-blue progressives want massive cuts in the military budget and a wholesale reorientation of American foreign policy toward longtime left-wing goals. Overall, the idea is a transformation of American budget priorities toward domestic spending.</td>
