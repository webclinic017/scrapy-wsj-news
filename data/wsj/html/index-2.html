Bruen about whether this policy is unconstitutional.<br />New York is one of only six states (the others are California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey) that condition the right to bear arms on an official’s discretion, which is not required to exercise any other constitutional right. Forty-four states provide for permits to carry guns without a subjective assessment of whether a person “needs” to do so, and 21 of those states don’t require a permit to carry in state, though many people get them anyway so they can carry in other states with which theirs has reciprocity.</td>

      <td>Dreaming offers imagination with no brakes and no control. One is set free to create, to fear, to lose and ﬁnd—and then interpret.</td>
      <td>Once there was a boy who feared to sleep, beset as he was by troubled dreams. His night terrors contained muddy alleys and dark streets gray with rain. He traveled with companions and knew that one of them would be sacrificed to the appetite of witches. He dreamed, too, of a dangerous criminal, invisible but lurking, hanging like a bat far above his head. And he dreamed of tigers that attacked in deep jungles, and of falling into the blue-black sea teeming with sharks. How, asks the Brazilian neuroscientist Sidarta Ribeiro, are we to make sense of “such a wealth of detail”? How can we explain the nature, recurrence and meaning of dreams? In “The Oracle of Night: The History and Science of Dreams,” Mr. Ribeiro seeks to answer these questions with a sweeping account as tangled and chaotic—and fascinating—as the dreams themselves.<br />Paradoxically familiar yet still mysterious, the “curious state of internal life that we call dreaming,” as Mr. Ribeiro describes it, allows persons and places to be exchanged or transformed “with incredible fluidity.” We build up our nightly narratives as “a simulacrum of reality constructed out of fragments of memories.” As a result, to interpret a dream requires “a deep understanding of the cognitive and emotional context of the dreamer.” “The Oracle of Night” is not, however, an attempt to demystify the act of dreaming. Instead, it reinfuses the dreamscape with beauty, mystery and significance. And it begins with Mr. Ribeiro’s own story; he was that dreaming boy.</td>

Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett seemed troubled by how the law is designed to frustrate federal court pre-enforcement review. The law bars state officials from enforcing it while empowering private individuals to sue anyone in Texas who performs or aids an abortion after six weeks. Plaintiffs who prevail are entitled to at least $10,000 in damages and legal fees.</td>

Case in point: The question Wednesday at the Court is whether ordinary New Yorkers lose the right to “bear Arms” in self-defense whenever they walk out their front doors.<br />New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen could close a gap in the High Court’s jurisprudence that has persisted too long. Regular citizens in New York face an almost insuperable bar if they want to bear a firearm for personal defense. Openly carrying a handgun is banned. And with certain exceptions, such as for judges and prison workers, getting a concealed-carry license requires demonstrating “proper cause.”</td>

      <td>Tom Hanks stars as a man riding out climate apocalypse with his canine and robotic companions in Miguel Sapochnik’s feature.</td>
      <td>Transporting the “Cast Away” motif into a landlocked St. Louis, “Finch” finds Tom Hanks playing a post-apocalyptic Robinson Crusoe marooned in the Midwest—which, like the rest of America, has been reduced to a sun-blasted desert where daylight sears the skin and starving humans lurk in the shadows at night. It should be said right away that “Finch” is probably one of the more upbeat accounts of doomsday in the oeuvre of dystopic fiction, although the cheeriness can sometimes make what’s terrible even more so.<br />Sharing a kinship with “The Martian,” “Moon,” “All Is Lost” and “Solaris” (both the Tarkovsky and Soderbergh versions), “Finch” is a solidly entertaining feature from director Miguel Sapochnik (“Game of Thrones”) and not quite a one-man effort by Mr. Hanks, even if he’s virtually the only actual human on screen. We first see his Finch struggling through a dust-clouded terrain in a helmet and what he calls his “UV suit,” singing “American Pie”—our tip-off that the time is not so very far away—and scavenging, mostly for food. He has a robot sidekick named Dewey—a cross between R2 D2 and the spare-parts hero of “WALL-E”—who helps Finch rummage through what looks like a derelict Walmart. There, Finch finds a can of dog food. He’s delighted. Thankfully, for us, he has a dog. But when he feeds the charming pup, named Goodyear, he also licks his fingers.</td>

Voters in Boston are poised to elect a woman as mayor for the first time in the city’s history. The Minneapolis election—the first since the unrest following the killing of George Floyd in May 2020—includes a mayoral race and a ballot item to decide whether to replace the police department with a department of public safety.</td>

That law authorizes tariffs for the sake of national security, but Mr. Trump’s gambit hurt his domestic economic-growth agenda and goaded the EU into imposing retaliatory tariffs on a range of U.S. goods from  Harley-Davidson  motorcycles to Kentucky bourbon.</td>

Unlike most global gabfests, it actually mattered—not because the sterile G-20 format and the anodyne communiqués it predictably generated meant or accomplished anything of significance. It mattered because the U.S. and the European Union, sidestepping the G-20 process, unveiled a tentative trade agreement that significantly sharpens the competition with China, and because five G-20 heads of government (China, Japan, Mexico, Russia and South Africa) were absent, highlighting the declining importance of these ritualized displays of international comity.<br />The most important news out of Rome had nothing to do with the G-20. The temporary trade deal announced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President Biden does more than put some of the Trump-era steel and aluminum tariffs and retaliatory measures on ice. It lays out a new approach to world trade that, if it takes hold, could usher in the most consequential changes to the international trade regime in half a century or more.</td>

In a steadily escalating campaign, she has checkmated every move I’ve made. She’s climbed a high deck, vaulted into pots on pedestals and hurled herself into baskets hung five feet above ground. Two live traps ignored. My dog, who is no slouch, has done his best. The squirrel watches and waits until my dog is indoors and I have driven off. Each time I come home, there’s another sad pile of bits where once there were blossoms. Still, Mary Roach’s “Fuzz: When Nature Breaks the Law” makes me feel grateful that my nemesis is only a rodent, and that I live in Ohio, not Colorado or India. My refrigerator will not be emptied by a bear; I will not be throttled by a leopard while taking out the compost.<br />Ms. Roach’s books have tackled human pursuits such as sex, digestion, death, war, space travel and even the afterlife, all with a “prove it to me!” attitude that is at turns exhilarating and astonishing. She wonders about the particulars many would prefer to leave a mystery, with a curiosity that is anything but childlike. With “Fuzz,” she focuses on those instances when nature, for a shocking change, wins.</td>

      <td>The singer-songwriter’s latest album sounds a lot like his past work and tells listeners exactly how they should feel.</td>
      <td>The staggering success of English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran is so difficult to comprehend one can only recite statistics: He has the most popular song of all time on Spotify—“Shape of You” is closing in on three billion streams—and he had the highest-grossing tour in music history, pulling in $775 million from nearly nine million paying customers in the string of concerts that came to a close in 2018. That massive single and tour were connected to “Divide,” the top-selling album of 2017, which won Best Pop Vocal Album at the Grammys. The tendency to think of Mr. Sheeran’s music, which is powered by his acoustic guitar strumming and his flexible tenor, in terms of figures on a balance sheet is helped along by the fact that his solo records are titled with mathematical symbols. “Divide” has the two dots and horizontal line we use for division, and his previous LPs, 2011’s “Plus” and 2014’s “Multiply,” both feature the associated operators. The flurry of record-setting data surrounding his work makes you want to reach for a calculator in order to get a handle on it.<br />On “Tides,” the opening track from Mr. Sheeran’s just-released fourth studio album, “Equals” (Asylum/Atlantic), the singer shares the feelings of uncertainty that came with his triumphs, and math is part of the equation: “I lost the confidence in who I was / Too busy trying to chase the high and get the numbers up.” It’s a stomping up-tempo number designed for clapping and shouting along—“I wanted something you could open with in a stadium,” he told Apple Music in a recent interview; he’s the rare musician in a position to think about such considerations—and it finds him reflecting on his previous album’s impact. Mr. Sheeran is somehow only 30, but for him that means he’s getting older, and he’s now married with a child. “Equals” is his attempt to square his desire for a tranquil family life and its associated pleasures with the reality of being a global celebrity.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Monday declined to review a federal foreign-intelligence court’s decision to keep secret its opinions authorizing the expansion of surveillance following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.<br />As is usual in such matters, the majority didn’t comment on its grounds for declining to consider the case. Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, dissented, arguing that the growing role of surveillance technology and its implications for democracy called for the Supreme Court’s review.</td>
