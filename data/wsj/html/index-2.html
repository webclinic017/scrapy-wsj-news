      <td>Attorney General Merrick Garland calls Gov. Greg Abbott’s executive order barring nonprofits from transporting asylum seekers dangerous and unlawful</td>
      <td>The Biden administration on Thursday threatened to sue Texas over an order from its governor banning the transportation of migrants within the state by anyone other than law enforcement, saying the move impinges on the federal government’s exclusive control over immigration matters.<br />In a letter to Gov. Greg Abbott, Attorney General Merrick Garland called Wednesday’s executive order “both dangerous and unlawful” and said it would impede immigration actions currently being undertaken by the federal government or private parties working with it.<br />The governor issued his order after local officials in the Rio Grande Valley complained of federal officials releasing immigrants there and of migrants in the care of Catholic Charities leaving their Covid quarantine to go to a hamburger restaurant.<br />Religious nonprofits sanctioned to work with the federal government, such as Catholic Charities, receive immigrants seeking asylum after the Border Patrol processes and releases them. As shelters have become full, the organizations have at times moved migrants between locations and quarantined them in hotels.<br />Mr. Garland urged Mr. Abbott to immediately lift the directive or face legal action by the Justice Department. “The Order would jeopardize the health and safety of noncitizens in federal government custody, federal law enforcement personnel and their families, and our communities,” the attorney general wrote. He said the state’s order interferes with the implementation of federal immigration law and would worsen and prolong overcrowding in shelters and facilities.</td>

      <td>Consumers are no longer glued to their computers. They are exploring the great outdoors, getting on airplanes again, dining out and enjoying friends and family. For  Pinterest ,  they are looking for inspiration in all the wrong places.<br />On the heels of banner results from social-media peers Snap ,  Inc.,  Twitter  and  Facebook over the last two weeks, the image-sharing company on Thursday reported stellar revenue growth of 125% year-over-year in the second quarter. But Pinterest also said that, as lockdowns have eased, fewer people are using its platform than expected. Global monthly active users grew more than 6 percentage points slower than Wall Street had anticipated, and U.S. monthly active users actually declined by 5% year on year.<br />Pinterest said its engagement headwinds continued past the end of the quarter, with U.S. monthly active users declining at a more rapid clip than analysts had been modeling for the quarter. Shares fell more than 18% immediately following the report.<br />Pinterest is losing its audience at a particularly bad time. The pandemic has accelerated retailers’ shift online, and advertisers seem especially willing to pay up to acquire new customers, as the economy opens back up. Pinterest also has been hard at work on its own monetization efforts, integrating with  Shopify ,  and expects to start on-platform transactions by the end of the year.<br />From a monetization standpoint, Pinterest is doing a lot right. As more business moves online, retailers will be able to track the return on their advertising dollars more easily than ever. With that in mind, Pinterest seems particularly well positioned to show what return advertisers are getting.  Morgan Stanley  estimates that 67% of its U.S. ad business is performance marketing, or ads focused on driving immediate traffic and sales, versus longer-term brand advertising. That estimate is the highest of all major social media players, according to the firm.</td>

      <td>The GOP gets roads and bridges. Democrats a green bonanza and more.</td>
      <td>Senate Republicans, or at least some of them, are taking a victory lap for striking a $1 trillion infrastructure deal with the White House. Hurrah! They can now retreat to the sidelines and let Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders negotiate a partisan multi-trillion dollar entitlement expansion that they have made easier to pass.<br />At least by the narrow terms of the infrastructure deal, the GOP negotiators can take credit for what isn’t in the bill. There’s no tax increase, and the $40 billion subsidy for the IRS in an earlier draft is out. There’s no new infrastructure bank, which would be an unending source of political corruption. The deal repurposes some $205 billion in Covid relief, which is better than new spending. That’s most of the good policy news.<br />The U.S. could use more investment in roads, bridges, cyber-security and ports, as well as for drought, wildfire and flood mitigation. But the test of any dollar taxed and spent by government should be whether its benefit will exceed its return if left in the private economy. Only a fraction of the spending in this deal meets that standard.<br />To get money for these traditional public works, Senate Republicans had to sign up for an epic binge of green subsidies and more handouts for states and localities. Consider mass transit, which received $70 billion in pandemic relief. Only about $20 billion of that has been spent. Yet Congress now will dole out another $90 billion over five years.<br />This is the “largest Federal investment in public transit in history,” a White House fact sheet boasts. Taxpayers in Little Rock are again subsidizing New York City’s subway and its fat union contracts. The deal includes an additional $66 billion for rail, $30 billion of which is earmarked for Amtrak's northeast corridor—a subsidy for political commuters.</td>

      <td>As the Taliban continue to gain ground in Afghanistan, the brutal reality of their advance is becoming hard to ignore. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday responded to “reports of atrocities committed by the Taliban in areas that it’s taken over that are deeply, deeply troubling.”<br />What did he expect would happen as the U.S. pulled out precipitously, leaving the Kabul government in the lurch? Mr. Blinken added that the recent reports “certainly do not speak well to the Taliban’s intentions for the country as a whole.” No kidding.<br />If the Taliban want international recognition or sanctions lifted, he said, “taking over the country by force and abusing the rights of its people is not the path.” Pleading isn’t the best strategy with an adversary.<br />The Taliban have a medieval worldview, and their goal is to subject the whole country to it. Take amputation as a punishment for theft. It’s rare now, per a Journal article from May, but “Zabiullah Mujahid, the movement’s spokesman, said amputations should be reinstated once a sufficiently stable system is in place, including healthcare to attend to cut-off limbs.”<br />Got that? They’ll resume hacking off body parts as soon as they have the wherewithal to bandage the stumps. This is not the outcome President Biden has told Americans to be ready to accept. If he wants to avoid it, he should give Kabul the air-power and other support it needs.</td>

      <td>Higher prices and slow investment mar a strong second quarter for the economy.</td>
      <td>America’s private economy is a wonderful machine that, left to its own devices, will find a way to grow. And so it has over the past year despite the burdens of the pandemic and government lockdowns, as Thursday’s report for second quarter GDP showed again.<br />The economy grew at a 6.5% annual rate —short of the 8.4% predicted by many economists. But that was still enough to lift U.S. GDP above its pre-pandemic peak to $22.72 trillion. The V-shaped recovery has come true since the two-month recession ended in April 2020.<br />Consumer spending drove most of the growth, especially on services, as even the most recalcitrant politicians finally lifted lockdowns. Consumption rose by 11.8% in the quarter after 11.4% in the first. Spending on travel, dining and nondurable goods is the low-hanging fruit of the recovery. Few opportunities to spend last year, plus unprecedented government payments, produced a record savings rate that fell by half to 10.9% in the quarter as wallets opened.<br />The disappointment is that growth wasn’t better, and you can blame a fall in inventories and private business investment. Domestic investment fell 3.5% in the quarter after falling 2.3% in the first. Home building slowed, as did businesses spending on structures.<br />The investment slowdown is surprising given the trend in consumer spending. Demand is rising across the economy, yet producers aren’t scaling up at the same pace, which could mean further price increases in the coming months. Businesses are having a hard time increasing production amid supply shortages, so they are drawing down inventories to meet demand for goods.</td>

      <td>Guess who pays for expanded social benefits?</td>
      <td>While Democrats create new middle-class entitlements, other countries are struggling to pay for the entitlements they already have. The latest example is the United Kingdom, where a debate over payroll-tax increases is a warning to American voters.<br />Prime Minister Boris Johnson is considering a one percentage-point increase in the payroll tax—euphemistically called the National Insurance Contribution—to fund more spending on the National Health Service and so-called social care such as nursing homes and home health care. The payroll tax stands at 12% for employees’ portion on income between £9,564 and £50,268 ($13,400-$70,200) and 2% on income above that level, and 13.8% for the employer share. The tax hike is expected to raise about £10 billion per year.<br />The NHS always has its hat out for more cash. But the pandemic exacerbated a crisis in social care, which provides for adults who can’t live independently due to old age or chronic conditions. Demand for these services grows inexorably as the population ages and its health deteriorates. Covid-19 outbreaks in nursing homes exposed poor conditions and inadequate staffing.<br />Successive Conservative governments have responded, perversely, by trying to make social care even more of a middle-class entitlement than it already is. Tories killed off a short-lived proposal from Theresa May to require middle-class households to use their home equity to offset what local governments spend for them on in-home care.<br />Now Mr. Johnson supports a cap on individual contributions for care costs. This is another sop to the middle class, since the low-income, low-wealth elderly and infirm already receive fully subsidized care. The political goal is to allow middle-class families to pass their homes and other assets to heirs while taxpayers pick up the care tab.</td>

      <td>E-commerce titan delivers rare sales and earnings miss during CEO transition</td>
      <td>OK, so maybe Jeff Bezos isn’t quite going out on top.<br />The final quarter for  Amazon.com  under the direct management of its famous founder turned out to be a bit of a letdown. Revenue and operating income for the second quarter both fell shy of Wall Street’s estimates, as did the high end of the company’s revenue forecast for the current quarter. It was the first time the e-commerce titan missed the high end of its own sales projections in two years, according to data from FactSet.  Amazon ’s  shares fell more than 7% following the results.<br />The company is still a juggernaut. Second-quarter revenue rose 27% to $113.1 billion, bringing trailing 12-month sales to more than $443 billion. That puts Amazon well on pace to overtake  Walmart  as the largest U.S. company by annual sales some time next year, while still growing at double-digit rates. Growth at the company’s crucial AWS cloud business also picked up, with revenue jumping 37% year over year compared with a 32% rise in the last quarter. That lines up with trends shown by cloud rivals  Microsoft  and Google earlier this week, suggesting that the market leader, AWS, is at least holding its ground.<br />But the boom in online sales Amazon enjoyed at the start of the pandemic created a challenging comparison for the most recent quarter. Thursday’s results confirmed the suspicions of some analysts that the company’s Prime Day sales event in late June underwhelmed. Amazon’s online stores segment saw revenue grow by only 16% to $53.2 billion in the second quarter, falling well short of analysts’ targets. Revenue growth from third-party and subscription services decelerated. Advertising revenue, reflected in the company’s “Other” segment, showed a strong jump of 87% year over year to $7.9 billion. But advertising still contributes only about 7% to Amazon’s total revenue.<br />The results create a bit more of a challenging setup for new CEO Andy Jassy as Amazon will face difficult comparisons for the rest of the year following its pandemic-fueled sales jump in 2020. But the bar seems low enough. The midpoint of the company’s revenue projection for the third quarter represents growth of 13% year over year. That would be Amazon’s slowest growth rate in 20 years, even with the pandemic picking back up and possibly driving more sales online.</td>

      <td>Adversaries could be developing technology to disrupt flight systems. The U.S. seems to be doing so.</td>
      <td>Have space aliens been visiting Earth? That’s the wrong question to be asking about UFOs—or, as they’re now officially called, unidentified aerial phenomena or UAP.<br />Last month the Office of the Director of National Intelligence sent Congress a preliminary assessment about UAP. It was produced by the Office of Naval Intelligence, which established a task force “to detect, analyze and catalog UAPs . . . that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security.”<br />After examining 144 credible event reports originating from U.S. government sources, the task force concluded that UAP could “threaten flight safety and, possibly, national security.” Many of the sightings took place in restricted airspace during military exercises, and until recently there was no reporting mechanism for such occurrences. This raises the possibility that the U.S. has become overconfident it is safe from attack.<br />The UAPTF was established after a series of unexplained aerial incidents with U.S. military pilots, a few of which were captured on video and published by the  New York Times .  In May,  CBS ’s  “60 Minutes” re-examined those videos and explored the possibility that the UAP were of extraterrestrial origin. It’s likelier, though, that they’re of terrestrial origin and are a definite threat to national security.<br />One fact the task force’s assessment doesn’t mention is that in 2018 the U.S. Navy registered a patent application for “a method where a laser beam is configured to generate a laser-induced plasma filament (LIPF), and the LIPF acts as a decoy to detract a homing missile or other threat from a specific target.”</td>

Since March 2020, our TV screens and social-media feeds have been dominated by pundits and politicians telling us how to behave during the pandemic. The noise is so loud it has muffled the voices of ordinary Americans whose lives have been forever shaped by the virus.<br />Covid-19 has had a profound impact on my life. I lost my husband, Luke, on Dec. 29, five days before he was set to be sworn in to Congress. I want to share our story in hope that it will encourage unvaccinated Americans to get vaccinated before it’s too late.<br />When Luke was in the hospital, he told me numerous times that he wanted to help people understand the seriousness of the virus. He knew that misinformation was running rampant, and he wanted to hold a press conference in his hospital room to share his experience with others. Sadly, he succumbed to the virus before he could tell that story.<br />It was horrific to watch the person I love most have to gasp for every breath to stay alive. Seeing the color and life slowly drain from the body of my otherwise perfectly healthy husband was the most painful thing I have ever endured. It is an experience I wouldn’t wish on anybody.<br />Luke died two weeks before Moderna’s vaccine became available to the public. He was 41. I would have given everything to get him that lifesaving shot. Before he contracted Covid, we often prayed together for the vaccine, hoping that it would bring relief to our family and so many others. I know that he was ready to get vaccinated and would have encouraged his friends, family members and constituents to follow suit.</td>

Yet suborbital space is becoming increasingly accessible to nonastronauts. The recent flights by Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos on rockets their companies built demonstrated this dramatically.<br />The promise of private space enterprise should be harnessed by American leaders to gain an advantage in the space race with China. China has been active by landing a rover on Mars and achieving the first landing on the far side of the moon.<br />If the U.S. hopes to win this space race, public support will be crucial. Yet a recent Morning Consult poll shows Americans rank space 25th in a list of 26 priorities for the Biden administration. Americans aren’t inspired by space in the way they were in the 1950s and ’60s, when space travel thoroughly captured the American consciousness.<br />To rekindle the spirit of American adventure, a U.S. president should travel to space by the end of the decade. This will show that space is a priority for American leadership, and it will signal that the best has yet to come.</td>

      <td>The brief by Mississippi’s attorney general makes a surprising argument aimed at Chief Justice Roberts.</td>
      <td>No finer or more important brief has been submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court in many decades than the one Mississippi Solicitor General Scott G. Stewart filed last Thursday in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the abortion case the justices will hear in the fall. Dobbs is the most important challenge to Roe v. Wade (1973) since Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), in which the court upheld Roe’s “essential holding” 5-4. Thanks to Mr. Stewart’s handiwork, Roe’s status is more fragile than ever.<br />A Stanford Law School graduate who clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas, Mr. Stewart is most immediately targeting the court’s 48-year reliance on fetal viability (approximately 24 weeks of pregnancy) as the decisive point prior to which state efforts to prohibit abortions are voided. Mr. Stewart argues that “a viability rule has no constitutional basis” and that “even if the ‘liberty’ secured by” the 14th Amendment’s Due Process Clause does “protect some right to abortion, nothing in constitutional history or tradition supports tying such a right to viability.”<br />Mr. Stewart also targets Casey’s “undue burden” standard, contending that “there is no objective way to decide whether a burden is ‘undue.’ ” He cites the court’s own recent abortion rulings as proof that the standard “cannot produce a workable, administrable, predictable jurisprudence.” In last year’s June Medical decision, the five justices who supported the judgment “could not agree on what Casey means.” At a minimum, Mr. Stewart argues that Mississippi’s effort to ban elective abortions after 15 weeks “does not pose an undue burden because it does not,” quoting court precedent, “ ‘prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy’ ” so long as she acts quickly enough.<br />But viability and the undue-burden standard are only Mr. Stewart’s intermediate targets. The true crux of his brief, aimed squarely at Chief Justice John Roberts, is that it is in the court’s institutional self-interest to jettison Casey and Roe. Some observers, including this writer, have long believed that the justices’ pre-eminent attachment to the court’s own institutional legitimacy and reputation makes reversal of Roe, or Casey, virtually unimaginable. But Mr. Stewart fundamentally upends that calculus, and in so doing he presents Chief Justice Roberts and his colleagues with a legacy-defining choice.<br />“Casey retained Roe’s central holding largely on the view that overruling it would hurt this Court’s legitimacy,” Mr. Stewart observes. Yet since abortion remains “a wholly unsettled policy issue” in dozens of states, under Roe and Casey the federal judiciary “mows down state law after state law, year after year” with no end in sight. He quotes Justice Lewis Powell, who joined the majority in Roe, as warning in another context that “repeated and essentially head-on confrontations between the life-tenured and the representative branches of government will not, in the long run, be beneficial to either.”</td>

      <td>Dozens have gone up in flames, and the prime minister’s response is tepid.</td>
      <td>It has been a difficult summer for Canada’s Christians. Over five days in late June, four Catholic churches and an Anglican church were burned to the ground, the first churches to be set ablaze or vandalized to begin a summer of such desecration. Suspicious fires then broke out across the country. In all, at least 56 churches have been set aflame or vandalized, according to the True North Centre, which is mapping attacks on churches.<br />This is unquestionably a crisis, but you wouldn’t think it from observing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s response. Although the first suspected arson happened June 21, he didn’t speak out on the issue until July 1. Worse, after dozens of the incidents across seven different provinces and territories, there has been only one arrest. “Am I wrong,” askedAaron Wudrick of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, “or have more people been arrested in Canada this year for going inside a church to worship than for burning one down?”<br />Police are investigating whether the suspected arsons are connected to the news that hundreds of children were buried in unmarked graves at government-mandated, church-run Indian residential schools in Canada. The residential schools operated from 1883 to 1996 but were mostly wound down by the 1980s. They were populated by approximately 150,000 indigenous children separated from their parents and—following the progressive orthodoxy of the day—assimilated into Western culture. Such arrangements offend today’s sensibilities, but they were supported by politicians of all stripes, religious orders in various denominations, and education reformers.<br />It is understandable that some indigenous people feel anger and betrayal over these tragic institutions. The number of estimated remains at gravesites is astounding—more than 1,200 suspected unmarked graves were recently discovered at five former school sites in Western Canada—but it has long been known that there were a large number of fatalities. Many of these stories were reported by Canada’s 2015 Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and the schools’ abuses have been widely covered by the media.<br />Political leaders have mouthed platitudes about the need for “conversations” about the bitter legacy of Indian residential schools and for school curricula that do not whitewash what happened. Calls for education were not enough for those who apparently began to vandalize churches. Church leaders generally have avoided condemning the attacks, and, perhaps fearing backlash, offer only mealy-mouthed statements about working together for reconciliation.</td>

      <td>Rushed work can be shoddy, yet we dally and delay until the last minute, when a deadline suddenly concentrates the mind.</td>
      <td>Those who reside in the rustic belt often marvel when squirrels, possums and other quadrupeds wait until cars are right on them before commencing a mad dash across the road. Miscalculations result in an unpleasantly memorable squash, perhaps followed by the driver’s gratitude for being positioned higher up the Great Chain of Being.<br />Yet humans are also known to wait until the last minute to tackle whatever task is at hand. While miscalculations rarely reduce us to roadkill, they can have negative consequences. The good news, according to Christopher Cox in “The Deadline Effect,” is that we can make deadlines work for us instead of the other way around.<br />Mr. Cox, a longtime editor and writer, explains that the deadline was “originally the line on a printing press beyond which no type could be set”; during the Civil War, the “dead-line” was a boundary surrounding the stockade, “outside of which any prisoner would be shot.” Like nooses, deadlines can concentrate the mind. The problem is that, “as soon as you set a deadline, work tends to get delayed until right before time expires.” Rushed work can be shoddy; rushed deals can be ruinous.<br />One solution is the simple lie. An editor can issue a July deadline when October is the real drop-dead date. This strategy might even improve the final product, at least according to Viennese writer Karl Kraus (quoted by Mr. Cox): “A journalist is stimulated by a deadline. He writes worse when he has time.”<br />A better solution, Mr. Cox advises, is to set a “soft deadline with teeth.” These often amount to a rigorous rehearsal or dry run in advance of a hard deadline. The Jean-Georges restaurant group was in the process of opening two new restaurants in New York when Mr. Cox visited. “We make sure that we test, we test, we test, and test again,” chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten explained, a regimen that includes “mock services” that replicate opening night. The process, Mr. Cox writes, has “the virtues of the deadline effect (focus, urgency, cooperation) with none of the vices (rashness, desperation, incompleteness).”</td>

      <td>The ultra-agile climbing event without ropes got its name from rocks displaced during the Ice Age</td>
      <td>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.<br />One of the new Olympic sports making its debut in Tokyo is sport climbing, which enters competition on Aug. 3. It consists of three disciplines, all of which the athletes must master in the combined format. In lead climbing, competitors climb a wall as high as they can manage within six minutes while secured to safety ropes. And in speed climbing, two climbers simultaneously vie to scale a nearly 50-foot-high wall faster than their opponent, again using safety ropes.<br />The third discipline to test the climbers is known as “bouldering.” In this event, climbers must complete as many fixed routes as possible within four minutes, on a wall that is about 15 feet high with an array of different challenges. And it all must be done without the aid of ropes or harnesses, with climbers navigating the wall by quickly determining where to place their hands and feet.<br />“Bouldering” might seem like an unusual term for an athletic endeavor carried out on an artificial rock wall, with no actual boulders in sight. But it grows out of a tradition in climbing in which naturally occurring rock formations present climbers with different sequences of moves that must be performed, known in the sport as “problems.”<br />“Boulder” itself is a word that likely derives from a Scandinavian source, related to the Swedish term “bullersten.” A “bullersten” is a large stone found in a stream, and it can be translated as either “rounded stone” or “roaring stone”—the “roaring” referring to water noisily rushing past it.</td>

      <td>Matt Damon stars as a father trying to clear his daughter’s name in a murder case in Tom McCarthy’s new crime drama inspired by the Amanda Knox saga.</td>
      <td><br />Partly a story of a wayward father’s unswerving love for his wayward daughter and intermittently a romantic thriller, “Stillwater” is, most memorably, a hard-edged portrait of a roughneck from the Oklahoma oil patch—closed off, rigid, taciturn—who gradually opens up to himself and the world around him. The film, playing in theaters and directed by Tom McCarthy (“Spotlight”) from a script he wrote with Thomas Bidegain, Marcus Hinchey and Noé Debré, has its own rigidities, but Matt Damon, in the central role, confers a somber grace on a man who always thought he had none.<br />Bill Baker is a roughneck in many respects. A high-school dropout, he has stumbled through life from one odd job to another, doing drugs and boozing steadily along the way. He has also been a disastrous parent, a failing that leaves him and his estranged 20-something daughter, Allison (Abigail Breslin), in a terrible fix. She’s in prison in Marseille for having killed her French roommate and partner, a crime she claims she didn’t commit. A recently surfaced nugget of information might prove her innocence, but her mother is dead, leaving Bill as her best, worst and only hope of finding the guilty party and reopening her case. Worse still, his knowledge of French culture is nil, while his gifts as a linguist are limited to emitting short, gruff sentences in English. (The fictional case was loosely based on that of Amanda Knox, an American exchange student who was acquitted in 2015 of the charge of murdering her flatmate.)<br />The spectacle of Bill leaving his home and a construction job in Stillwater for the south of France is affecting, and all the more so when he arrives at a modest hotel in Marseille, carrying all his possessions in a rucksack and looking unmistakably American, from his shades perched above the visor of his baseball cap to his sturdy work boots. It turns out that this fish has been out of water here before, since Allison has already served one year of her five-year sentence. We’re given to understand that any previous visits were tense at best, but she’s his daughter and he won’t give up on her, even if she’s scornful of his ability to capitalize on what she considers new evidence and everyone else sees as shadowy hearsay.<br />In one sense “Stillwater” is a political drama. The film means to make us examine our assumptions about white working men from red states who look like Bill and share his stern visage. He is, in fact, a God-fearing citizen who owns a shotgun and a Glock and who may or may not lean hard right. (That’s dealt with adroitly when someone asks if he voted for Trump and he says no, then adds that he didn’t vote at all.) His affect is flat, whether from grievance, shyness or who knows what—so flat that the filmmakers come perilously close to reinforcing the cliché they mean to dispel.</td>

      <td>Black Widow has a new enemy: the  Walt Disney Co.<br />Scarlett Johansson, star of the latest Marvel movie “Black Widow,” filed a lawsuit Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court against  Disney ,  alleging her contract was breached when the media giant released the film on its Disney+ streaming service at the same time as its theatrical debut.<br />Ms. Johansson said in the suit that her agreement with Disney’s Marvel Entertainment guaranteed an exclusive theatrical release, and her salary was based in large part on the box-office performance of the film.<br />“Disney intentionally induced Marvel’s breach of the agreement, without justification, in order to prevent Ms. Johansson from realizing the full benefit of her bargain with Marvel,” the suit said.<br />A Disney spokesman said Ms. Johansson’s suit had no merit and is “especially sad and distressing in its callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.” The company said it “fully complied with Ms. Johansson’s contract and furthermore, the release of Black Widow on Disney+ with Premier Access has significantly enhanced her ability to earn additional compensation on top of the $20 million she has received to date.”</td>

      <td>Filmmaker David Lowery adapts the 14th-century Arthurian legend into a fantasy film starring Dev Patel as an aspirant knight on a perilous journey.</td>
      <td>An eye for an eye is kid stuff compared to the equivalency set forth near the beginning of “The Green Knight,” David Lowery’s mysterious, fantastical and astonishingly beautiful retelling of the 14th-century epic poem “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.” The knight in question is a towering creature with a tree-like head and face that might remind sci-fi fans of Groot from “Guardians of the Galaxy.” He appears at the gates of Camelot at Christmastime, rides his horse right up to King Arthur’s Round Table and asks if anyone present will engage him in combat, the proviso being that whatever injury he may sustain will be returned in kind at his far-off Green Chapel on the following Christmas Day. The challenge is accepted by Gawain (Dev Patel), who lops off the knight’s head with a single stroke of his sword, then embarks on a yearlong journey of honor that seems destined to end with his own beheading.<br />Why does Gawain volunteer? It’s tempting to say that he’s headstrong because he is—a young man, not yet a knight, who is a spoiled, lusty and blithely charming nephew of the king. Gawain wants to prove that he’s made of sterner stuff and aspires to goodness if not greatness, a concept he finds intimidating. Put more simply, he feels the need to discover himself.<br />Simplicity was the magical ingredient in Mr. Lowery’s 2017 feature “A Ghost Story,” a poetic, unexpectedly affecting meditation on loss and yearning in which the ghost is nothing more than a Halloweenish presence, an indeterminate form beneath a white sheet with empty eyeholes. “The Green Knight” is many things—hypnotic, cryptic, dramatic, occasionally funny, certainly poetic and often magical in its way—but simple isn’t one of them. I was puzzled by several of the apparitions Gawain encounters along his route. I wasn’t certain about the function of a white-haired woman who turns up in a blindfold from time to time, or the purpose of a rather pushy talking fox, or why Alicia Vikander plays dual roles, though she’s wonderfully warm and strong in both of them—stronger and smarter than Gawain, who has lots of growing to do. I even had trouble reading some of the stylized and possibly whimsical Gothic script that’s used to announce the story’s successive sections.<br />What’s clear, however, is that Gawain does grow, in spirit as well as physical prowess, and that Mr. Patel makes him alluring and endearing, never mind broodingly handsome. A subtly modern figure at the center of a medieval Christian allegory, Gawain is a hero who has no use for heroics and arrives at courage by way of circuitous self-doubt. And by way of darkly sumptuous settings and sweepingly expansive landscapes. “The Green Knight” doesn’t aspire to the bedazzlements of John Boorman’s 1981 Arthurian classic “Excalibur,” but the production, designed by Jade Healy, and the cinematography, by Andrew Droz Palermo, bespeak the solitude of the period.<br />That’s not to say the spectacle isn’t fascinating, even delightful now and then. In the very first scene the camera studies a barnyard where nothing special is going on, apart from a goose giving a goat a hard time. But there’s a slow-burning development in the background, a few small fingers of fire that emerge from an upstairs window of a nearby house, then turn into a conflagration that consumes the thatched roof. What’s that all about? A reminder, perhaps, of the dangers of the age, the random, ravaging events that test everyone’s faith.</td>

      <td>The retail-heavy strategy of its IPO may be questioned after its first-day drop, but the broker’s fundamentals are what matter now</td>
      <td>There were warning signs that  Robinhood ’s  men and women weren’t going to be so merry on Thursday.<br />Leading up to its trading debut, Robinhood priced its shares at the bottom of its pre-IPO range and didn’t maximize the potential allocation to its own customers. Instead of as much as 35%, they received around 20% to 25% of the shares, according to The Wall Street Journal. Whatever the reasoning behind those moves, they evidently didn’t leave the impression of a hot issue. The shares fell 8.4% from their offering price by the end of the session.<br />The issue may have gone beyond perceptions. It is true that IPOs are never easy to price or predict, and some dynamic about the allocation may have played a big role in what happened. There was the additional wild card of employees being able to sell some of their stock in the first trading session. But at the end of the day, IPO maneuvers will always struggle to overcome any fundamental doubts about a company at the given price range.<br />Robinhood is going public at what could prove to be the top of a cycle of small-investor activity, both in stocks and in cryptocurrency. That causes investors to not have faith in their projections. A similar thing likely happened when Coinbase Global went public, with that stock now well below where it made its debut. Add to that some uncertainty—or at least bad publicity—around its primary revenue source of payment-for-order-flow on customer trades.<br />Robinhood also was hardly giving away the shares. With its IPO priced at $38, around $32 billion in market value, the company asked investors to value a funded Robinhood account in the ballpark of what an E*Trade customer was worth to  Morgan Stanley  when it bought that retail broker. Never mind that Robinhood generates far less revenue per customer on far smaller average account sizes than that rival did, relying instead for now on very rapid account growth.</td>

      <td>Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson and Emily Blunt star in this Disney picture, set in 1916, about a trek down the Amazon in search of a tree with magical healing powers.</td>
      <td>‘Jungle Cruise” will take a few hits for being a Disney production based on a Disney theme-park ride and airing on Disney+. But anyone already subscribing to Disney+ won’t be phased, as only the rare Disney+ presentation doesn’t plug another Disney product. And besides, this one’s pretty entertaining, although increasingly noisy and ultimately ridiculous.<br />The noisy-ridiculous parts come later, as do some intense, scary and violent bits that may be too much for very tiny children, though the presence of Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock, seems to have a palliative effect on tots. He has a charisma similar to that of other kid-friendly giants like Shaquille O’Neal or Big Bird: size matters. This proves especially true aboard the “African Queen”-meets-“Fitzcarraldo” riverboat of wisecracking Capt. Frank Wolff (Mr. Johnson), who is dragooned into a seemingly impossible search down the Amazon by the intrepid Dr. Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt), who wears pants, even in 1916.<br />The trousers are a bit of a tell in this alleged period piece. (Non- subscribers will be able to see it for a limited time in theaters.) Its action begins at the Royal Anthropological and Diverse Adventures Society (a stand-in for London’s venerable Royal Society) where MacGregor Houghton (Jack Whitehall)—who will later come out as gay—is pitching the membership for funding. He and his scientist sister (whom he never mentions, and who couldn’t even get in the room) want to journey in search of the Tears of the Moon, a legendary tree whose elliptical blossoms promise to cure any illness and reverse any curse. The latter, it should be noted, will become quite important to the story.<br />While MacGregor drones on before a hostile audience, Lily scours the place for a sacred arrowhead—the same item being hunted there by a man dressed like a Prussian colonel and who acts like a furious infant (Jesse Plemons). She wants the object for healing and peace; he wants it for pure power. He also turns out to be the youngest son of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Two years into the Great War, he’s the one human aspect of the film that seems period-suitable.<br />There’s another villain at large: Lope de Aguirre (the movie’s second Werner Herzog reference, for anyone counting). Played by Edgar Ramírez, the bloodthirsty Spanish conquistador apparently made the mistake, 400 years earlier, of angering a tribal chieftain while in search of the Tears of the Moon and bringing a curse down on himself and his men. His resurrected corpse will give Frank no end of headaches—and snakes, snares and Aguirre’s henchmen whom time has turned into human beehives, adrip with honey. The effects, unsurprisingly, are extravagant. So are Frank’s painful dad jokes, delivered when taking a boatload of his tourists downriver. “Of all the jungle cruises you can take,” he says, “this is undoubtedly the cheapest.”</td>

About 8.2 million adults were behind on their rent or mortgage as of July 5 and have low confidence they can pay on time next month, a Census Bureau survey showed.<br />Ms. Psaki said the CDC moratorium was ending at a time of heightened vulnerability for tenants as the Covid-19 Delta variant continued to spread in many parts of the country, but she said congressional action was the only path forward.</td>

      <td>A Netflix docuseries examines the rise and fall of the auto-industry innovator through never-before-seen footage and interviews with the people who knew him best.</td>
      <td>The subject of “Myth & Mogul: John DeLorean” is portrayed as both a swashbuckling hero and a scurvy pirate; a visionary innovator and an unscrupulous huckster. It’s a credit to the filmmakers that both John DeLoreans come across so powerfully in this unorthodox and fully involving three-part series. Even his most sympathetic champions have to concede that the man was as smooth as stainless steel and equally impenetrable.<br />DeLorean, who died in 2005 at age 80, was a car-industry wunderkind, a brilliant engineer, the youngest-ever head of a division at General Motors and father of the muscle car—he’s credited with having introduced the Pontiac GTO and for identifying the importance of youth culture to car sales. He left GM in 1973 to start his own company, DeLorean Motor Co., which produced the stainless-steel-bodied sports car used, famously, as the time machine in “Back to the Future.”<br />The original title of this U.K. documentary series directed by Mike Connolly was, in fact, “DeLorean: Back From the Future,” and the vast financial contributions of the British government to DeLorean’s Northern Irish auto plant play a major part in the story: When DeLorean’s dream car started to spin out financially, there were hundreds of jobs poised to be lost in Belfast, precisely when the Troubles were at their worst. With the company on life-support, DeLorean was arrested for cocaine trafficking in trafficking in 1982, the result of what his lawyers described as a sting operation and what many interviewees conclude was a desperate attempt to raise money to keep his company afloat. His trial was California’s most media-celebrated until O.J. Simpson. His career was effectively over, despite the view that the FBI had set him up. “Would you buy a used car from me?” he asked reporters following his acquittal in Los Angeles. DeLorean’s middle name was actually Zachary. It might have been Chutzpah.<br />DeLorean had plenty of that and always did, according to “Myth & Mogul” and the people Mr. Connolly interviews, including filmmaker Chris Hegedus, who appears on camera along with some unseen footage from the 1981 documentary, “DeLorean,” made by her and her husband, D.A. Pennebaker. (he died in 2019.) Her recollections are essential to the personal side of the portrait being created by director Connolly, as are those of DeLorean’s ex-wife, model Cristina Ferrare, and their son, Zach, who seems profoundly conflicted about both his father’s legacy and his father.<br />Some of the sharper insights about DeLorean the man—as opposed to the car maker, about whom there are plenty—come from author Gail Sheehy, who interviewed DeLorean for her landmark 1976 book, “Passages,” about midlife crises. Ms. Sheehy clears up several puzzling things that precede her appearance in the series, not just about the subject’s psychology but his face: Seen in clips as a buttoned-down ’50s Detroit executive, DeLorean is barely recognizable, and not just because of the conservative suits and board-room haircut. As part of his midlife meltdown, out of which came his car company, he also had extensive plastic surgery, which included a lengthening of his jaw. Later came the crown of modish white hair, the DeLorean trademark. As Ms. Sheehy explains, the face and the car came from the same impulse to remake himself and the American auto industry. And to maintain what he’d created, he’d do just about anything.</td>

      <td>A New Zealand feature, now streaming on Netflix, follows three Maori cousins over the course of decades and shines light on the struggles of indigenous peoples.</td>
      <td>Treasures lie buried in the sedimentary layers of the streaming services. One of them, newly available on Netflix, is “Cousins,” an intricate and ambitious feature from New Zealand, in English and subtitled Maori, that was directed by Ainsley Gardiner and Briar Grace Smith from the latter’s adaptation of a novel by Patricia Grace. It’s a memory mosaic about the bonds, unbreakable though frayed for decades, that connect three Maori women from the 1940s to the present. The story’s larger concerns, forcefully stated, are those common to indigenous peoples—the primacy of family, the sacred nature of the land. What gives the film its distinction is the grace and intimacy with which it depicts the cousins’ girlhoods, and the quality of the performances—superb throughout, remarkably well-matched at every stage of each character’s life, and, in the case of a homeless wanderer who was once a lovely, ardent child, nothing less than extraordinary.<br />The wanderer’s name is Mata. The daughter of a Maori mother and an abusive white father, she has ended up alone and bereft, her mind clouded by mental illness. Tanea Heke plays her in old age with a haunting quietude, apart from her darting eyes, that seems to suggest Mata remembers, or can’t forget, everything that has happened since her father consigned her to an orphanage—eerily named the Mercy Home for Desolate Children—where she was told her new name was May and she had no other living relatives.<br />Like many nations these days, New Zealand is struggling to confront the policies and historical attitudes that have torn the social fabric of its indigenous minority. In depicting the intentional or casual cruelties visited on Mata, “Cousins” serves as powerful drama and stern accusation. The narrative’s engine is the continuing search for the family’s lost lamb by her successful and formidable cousins—scholarly Makareta, who fled an arranged marriage (she’s played in her latter years by Ms. Smith), and funny, spunky Missy, who has stayed on her ancestral land. (Rachel House fills the role in Missy’s cowgirl-matriarch incarnation.) One of the most affecting movie moments in my recent memory is when Makareta crosses paths with Mata by chance on the streets of Wellington and slowly recognizes the bright spirit her cousin was in the tragic ruin she’s become. “Cousins” can be harrowing as well as rewarding, but it’s a small gem in an ideal mounting—a huge network of subscribers who need only search it out.</td>

Despite the administration’s monthslong push to promote the shots and encourage people to get them, the overall pace of vaccinations has slowed.<br />The White House said the federal government employs more than four million people, including more than two million civilians, most of whom are outside the Washington, D.C., area. Fewer than 5% of people in federal civilian jobs are in the five states with the lowest vaccination rates, federal data show. Mr. Biden also wants his new requirements to apply to all federal contractors and will encourage private employers to take similar steps.</td>

      <td>Vote drew broad support among Democrats and Republicans after bipartisan negotiations</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Senate and House voted overwhelmingly to pass a $2.1 billion supplemental spending bill to fund Capitol security upgrades and pay for emergency aid to resettle Afghan refugees who worked alongside U.S. troops.<br />The bill, which passed the Senate 98-0 and the House 416-11, was the product of bipartisan negotiations between Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, the panel’s top Republican.<br />Lawmakers said the additional resources were urgently necessary to pay costs incurred from the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, and to ensure the U.S. doesn’t abandon its partners in Afghanistan as American troops withdraw.<br />In all, the bill will designate more than $520 million to reimburse the National Guard for its deployment to the Capitol after Jan. 6, $100 million for Capitol Police, $300 million for Capitol security measures such as hardening windows and doors and installing new cameras, $42 million to cover Congress’s Covid-19 costs and $1.1 billion to help resettle Afghans.<br />Mr. Leahy estimated that the legislation will result in 8,000 new Afghan Special Immigrant Visas with changes to the program to improve efficiency.</td>

Eligibility includes individuals, or those representing a deceased individual, who were present at the World Trade Center and surrounding areas; the crash site at the Pentagon; and the United Flight 93 crash site near Shanksville, Pa., between Sept. 11, 2001, and May 30, 2002.<br />It is estimated that around 400,000 people were exposed to caustic dust and toxic pollutants in the 9/11 dust and debris cloud, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Individuals must have been diagnosed with an illness related to the attacks.<br />There are two main deadlines involving filing a claim for the fund: a registration deadline and a claim filing deadline. “Registration is the first step in the claim filing process and it simply preserves your right to file a claim in the future,” according to the VCF website.<br />Registration deadlines vary based on individual circumstances, according to the VCF.</td>

The stock later climbed to approach the IPO price before falling again in the final hour of trading to close at $34.82.<br />A poor first-day performance is what Robinhood and its underwriters were trying to avoid by pricing shares at the bottom of its targeted range at a value of about $32 billion. The company and bankers wanted to be conservative to ensure a successful first day of trading, according to people familiar with the matter, in part because Robinhood sold a big chunk of its shares to small-time investors.<br />Breaking with a Wall Street convention to give individual investors only a minuscule slice of hot IPOs, Robinhood said it would allocate up to 35% of its offering to its own users. In the end, Robinhood customers got between 20% and 25% of the IPO, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />“One of our company values is ‘participation is power,’” Chief Executive Vlad Tenev said in an interview. “It didn’t seem right for us that IPOs had typically been reserved for the top 1%.”</td>

That included data that showed the vaccine’s ability to prevent severe illness in the age group had dropped to 81% in July from 97% in April, according to Dr. Gili Regev-Yochay, director of the infectious disease epidemiology unit at Sheba Medical Center in central Israel.<br />Pfizer on Wednesday said it plans to seek clearance next month from U.S. regulators to distribute a booster shot. Separately, it released an analysis of subjects from its large late-stage study that showed protection against symptomatic disease from its vaccine dropped every two months, to 84% after six months from a peak of 96% within two months of vaccination among all age groups. The analysis hasn’t been peer-reviewed.<br />A recent study from the U.K. published in the New England Journal of Medicine found the Pfizer vaccine was 88% effective at protecting against symptomatic disease from April 5 to May 16, but didn’t stratify by age groups.</td>

      <td>IT WAS RATATOUILLE, the southern-French compote of eggplant, tomatoes, zucchini, onions and peppers, that taught me the meaning of “umami.” I didn’t know the word as a 10-year-old first encountering the dish, but when I came across it years later and had to look it up, I thought: That’s ratatouille, a deeply ruddy alloy of flavors fused together to become something irresistible.<br />I will always remember the first time I tried ratatouille, on a muggy July night, on the side of a crab-grass-covered hill overlooking Burial Hill beach on the littoral of Long Island Sound, in Greens Farms, Conn. The dark sky erupted in red comets and golden blossoms; I winced each time, waiting to feel the fireworks’ explosion in my rib cage. I got an occasional whiff of gunpowder, but, more than anything, the lazy, briny breeze brought the scent of charred meat from a dozen barbecues.<br />More exciting, however, was discovering the contents of the Birkbee family’s woven-spruce picnic basket. The object itself was alluring, solid and so tidy. Inside was real silverware rolled in napkins of the red-and-white check fabric I would later associate with Paris bistros.<br />My mother and Mrs. Birkbee had grown up together in Boston, but somewhere along the way their ideas about what constituted a good picnic had diverged. We met every year to watch the fireworks, the Birkbees driving up from Stamford with their son, Dana. On one of these occasions I first sipped gazpacho, poured chilled from a thermos into a stout glass. At other picnics I sampled fleshy green Sicilian olives, scarfed down as much fennel-seed-flavored salami as I could before my mother glared at me, and warily nibbled a little piece of pâté studded with bright-green pistachios.<br />My family’s cherry-red Coleman cooler typically held onion dip for chips, chicken marinated in bottled Italian dressing for barbecuing, potato salad that smelled slightly sulfurous, and maybe some supermarket coleslaw. “Why do the Birkbees eat such interesting things?” I asked. “Mrs. Birkbee doesn’t have four children to feed,” my mother replied crossly. Mr. Birkbee was a gentle man, a textile designer; his tennis-loving wife was short and lean. They shared a love of travel and good food.</td>

All Disney parks employees will wear masks indoors, as well. Face masks will be required regardless of a person’s vaccination status.<br />“We are adapting our health and safety guidelines based on guidance from health and government officials,” a Disney spokesperson said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Tuesday that vaccinated people resume wearing masks in some indoor spaces.<br />The reinforcement of masks is just the latest chapter in Disney’s 16-month saga of reopening its theme parks in the wake of Covid-19. The pandemic threatened Disney’s business in unprecedented ways, eliminating more than $1 billion from its bottom line and leading to the layoffs of tens of thousands of workers. As the economy reopened earlier this year, Disney’s response—and consumers’ enthusiasm to get back to the parks—became a telltale of the country’s larger re-emergence.<br />In June, Disney told visitors to Walt Disney World they could lose the masks “in most areas” if they were vaccinated. At the time, Disney Chief Executive Bob Chapek said the change was “very big news for us, particularly if anyone has been in Florida in the middle of summer with a mask on.”</td>

      <td>New research sheds light on the behavior of liquids and gases under extreme conditions.</td>
      <td>What do superhot fireballs produced at big particle accelerators have in common with the steam in your pressure cooker and the ice in your refrigerator? The answer is quite a lot, according to scientists trying to understand the nature of matter in neutron stars, the early universe and other extreme conditions.<br />Everyday experience with water in our kitchens exposes us to how the same material has different phases—liquid water, gaseous steam and solid ice. Similarly, we breathe in gaseous oxygen to power our metabolism, while we use liquid and solid oxygen as rocket fuel.<br />Yet the fact that matter has different phases is profoundly strange. Science has studied it deeply since the 19th century, but it wasn’t until the late 20th century that theory caught up to reality fully. In 1982, physicist Kenneth Wilson won the Nobel Prize for his theoretical work on phases of matter.<br />By subjecting water to varying temperature and pressure, we can map out a “phase diagram” that depicts the form it takes under different conditions. When you bring water to a boil on the stove by applying heat, the temperature pauses in its rise at the boiling point, and the heat instead goes into changing liquid into gas; this is called latent heat. The stable boiling temperature of water is quite useful in cooking, as it helps us to get predictable results. We can also tweak the boiling point using a pressure cooker.<br />At higher pressures, the boiling temperature increases while the latent heat shrinks. Eventually, at exactly 217.25 times atmospheric pressure, the latent heat vanishes altogether. At that point the water passes from liquid to gas continuously; those phases are no longer distinct. Just below the critical pressure, the water boils at a limiting temperature of 373.946 degrees Celsius, or about 705 degrees Fahrenheit.</td>

      <td>This agreement makes necessary investments without destructive tax increases.</td>
      <td>Tax reform was a signature achievement of President Trump’s tenure. Before the pandemic, it helped fuel robust economic growth, leading to record low unemployment, higher wages, and the lowest poverty rate since the metric was established in 1959. Eliminating the 2017 reforms and imposing massive new tax hikes to fund huge spending increases for social programs will lead to even higher inflation, hurt working families, and disrupt our economic recovery.<br />This spring, Democrats used a special budget process to pass a purely partisan $1.9 trillion “pandemic relief” bill. And now, with the country already feeling the inflationary effects of this stimulus, they plan to use this same partisan budget process to pass another reckless tax and spending bill of at least $3.5 trillion that would further stall economic growth.<br />What isn’t partisan, however, is an entirely separate legislative initiative to invest long-term in the nation’s infrastructure. We can all agree that America’s roads, bridges, rails and ports need repair, and that without more investment in these long-term, hard assets, and the digital infrastructure needed to expand high-speed internet, we will continue to fall behind other countries. As a percentage of its economy, China spends nearly four times what the U.S. spends on infrastructure.<br />Presidents Obama and Trump advocated robust programs to invest in infrastructure. Neither succeeded because of partisan disagreements on how to pay for it.<br />When the Biden administration turned its attention to infrastructure earlier this year, it proposed a $2.65 trillion “infrastructure” bill with destructive tax increases and billions in spending unrelated to core infrastructure.

      <td>The American Guide series, published under the auspices of the Depression-era Federal Writers’ Project, has taken on the aura of a classic.</td>
      <td>If most other writers are like me (and I suspect they are), they leave behind them a trail of abandoned projects. On a fairly regular basis, one is hit with an idea for an essay, a story, a book. One investigates until coming to the conclusion (most of the time) that this won’t pan out or (rarely) that it’s a go.<br />Among my own won’t-pan-outs was the Federal Writers’ Project. This was a Depression-era enterprise, a wing of the Works Progress Administration, in which unemployed writers (during the Depression, there was basically no other kind) were hired by the government to fan out across the country, find out what was going on in the 48 states, New York City and the District of Columbia, and produce a thick guidebook to each locale—plus a good deal of additional material, including extensive interviews with formerly enslaved people that have since proved invaluable to scholars. A fascinating topic, to be sure, especially considering that the American Guide series has subsequently taken on the aura of a classic—regularly reprinted, and inspiring the likes of John Steinbeck and William Least Heat-Moon in their own travel books—and that the young men and women who labored on the project included such future eminences as Nelson Algren, Saul Bellow, John Cheever, Ralph Ellison, Zora Neale Hurston, Kenneth Rexroth, May Swenson, Studs Terkel and Richard Wright.<br />I investigated long enough to decide that the vein had been sufficiently mined by others and wouldn’t reward further excavation by me. Actually, I think I decided this after looking at just one book, Jerre Mangione’s “The Dream and the Deal” (1972). Mangione was another of those young writers hired by the project, in his case for an executive position; he would go on to write highly praised novels and memoirs. Even though it was decades old, his history of the FWP, besides being informed by his own experience, stood up as being solidly researched, and intelligently and gracefully written: in short, definitive. Moreover, it was followed by several academic works on the project and a few popular ones, notably “Soul of a People” (2009), by David A. Taylor, which inspired a documentary of the same name on the Smithsonian Channel.<br />So I feel I made the right move in going on to other ventures. But here’s the thing: Scott Borchert also made the right move in pursuing this one. His “Republic of Detours: How the New Deal Paid Broke Writers to Rediscover America” shows that when a good writer meets a subject for which he or she has a passion, the result is almost always going to be fine, no matter that others have treated it before. As he observes, “just as you might take many routes across a state, choosing where to stop and what to pass by, trading detours and dead ends, so there are many possible ways to tell this story.”<br />Mr. Borchert’s own way is marked by several signal attributes. He’s excellent at character studies, offering fresh takes and material on familiar figures like Algren, Hurston and Wright, and introducing us to lesser-known ones like Vardis Fisher, a cranky novelist who pretty much single-handedly wrote the Idaho guide, and, most important, Henry Alsberg, the shambling, closeted veteran journalist and litterateur who served as the FWP’s director and, somehow, kept it all together.</td>

      <td>PARENTS ARE facing a back-to-school and back-to-in-person-activities challenge: How to give teens and preteens a way to reach them, without opening a door to the screentime temptations that come with a smartphone.<br />A growing contingent of child psychologists and other experts recommend parents “Wait Until 8th” (as in eighth grade) to give their child an unrestricted internet-connected device. “At the stage of development where [kids] are struggling the most with focus, impulse control and identity, we prematurely give them an adult tool that provides distractions,” said Melanie Hempe, the founder of ScreenStrong, which advocates for reducing screen time for children.<br />Some parents use software like Bark or Qustodio to place limits on kids’ smartphones. Others purchase “basic feature” phones (aka “dumb phones” or flip phones) for their kids. These days, however, even flip phones can usually access the internet, so it’s better to pick a device that offers more control. Here, four favorites of parents, experts and kids.<br />The Light Phone II won’t allow your child to get on the Internet or social media, but it will allow him to call and text (including group chats) on the  AT&T  network, as well as access simple tools like an alarm, calculator and music/podcast player. The sleek black-and-white design looks grown-up enough to appease your 13-going-on-30 middle schooler. But the device is more expensive than our other picks, doesn’t currently offer GPS tracking and won’t ship until the fall. $299 plus plans from $30/month, thelightphone.com<br />Designed to mimic the appearance of an iPhone or Android (but without access to internet, games or social media) the Gabb is great for kids concerned with being the odd one out. It’s also the device Ms. Hempe recommends to families because of its accessible price and plethora of parental controls—from screen-time limits to GPS tracking. The phones run on Gabb’s own 4G LTE network, no contract required. $100 plus plans from $20/month, gabbwireless.com</td>

      <td>Investigation commissioned by Credit Suisse’s board holds lessons for bankers, regulators and investors</td>
      <td>Archegos Capital Management was one of the biggest trading disasters of all time, leading to $10 billion of losses across Wall Street. Hardest hit among the banks was  Credit Suisse ,  which on Thursday published a lengthy investigation into what went wrong, unveiling many new details of failures inside the bank.<br />The report is similar to the lengthy reviews that followed JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s $6 billion trading loss, known as the “London Whale” episode, and  Wells Fargo  & Co.’s sales-practice scandal. It is likely to be studied closely by bankers, regulators and investors hoping once again that this sort of thing doesn’t happen again.<br />Here are some key takeaways from the report.<br />Increasing revenue from Archegos drove decision making, and risk reduction wasn’t the priority, according to the report. Senior people in the prime services unit handling the Archegos business had access to information showing Archegos’s risks were mounting. But they either ignored them or lacked competence to appreciate their significance, the report found. Revenue from Archegos since 2017 came to around $60 million. Credit Suisse said it is seeking to improve its culture so that “every employee will again become a risk manager.”<br />Co-heads of the prime services division were split between New York and London, with neither believing he was responsible for supervising the Archegos relationship.</td>

Infections have risen quickly in both places, pushing political leaders and public health experts to seek new ways to get people motivated to get vaccinated.<br />In Europe, some governments are seeking to convince people by putting restrictions on those who don’t get vaccinated.

      <td>Emily Mortimer’s three-part miniseries ‘The Pursuit of Love’ comes to Amazon Prime Video, the Rock rides Disney’s ‘Jungle Cruise’ to the screen and Kevin Smith brings He-Man to Netflix</td>
      <td>Streaming gets another dose of nostalgia this week as an ’80s-era cartoon gets a reboot targeted at parents and their kids, and an amusement-park ride becomes a movie. There’s also a love story. Here’s where to find it all:<br />( Amazon  Prime Video)<br />“The Pursuit of Love,” a three-part British miniseries based on Nancy Mitford’s 1945 novel, is the directorial debut for actress Emily Mortimer, who also wrote the screenplay. Ms. Mortimer says that reading the book as a teenager, she was swept up in the love stories that populate the lives of its English heroines: the free-spirited Linda Radlett (Lily James) and her more traditional cousin and best friend Fanny Logan (Emily Beecham). Reading the book as a middle-aged woman and mother, however, she says she found Mitford’s treatment of taboo subjects like bad parenting radical and relatable.<br />“I felt very spoken to reading it both as a teenager and again as a middle-aged woman,” she says. “I wanted to find ways of it feeling like it wasn’t just about girls that lived in another era, but it was about girls that live in any era.”<br />Though the story takes place in the 1930s and ’40s, Ms. Mortimer infused the series with a rock ’n’ roll soundtrack—New Order, the Who, Sleater-Kinney—and other flourishes to give it the timeless tone and punk-rock soul she feels in the book’s pages. Though she sometimes wondered if she was pushing things too far, Ms. Mortimer says her moments of doubt were silenced when her instincts were confirmed. When she reached out to Marianne Faithfull to ask if she could use her song “Give My Love to London,” for example, she got a note back from Ms. Faithfull saying “The Pursuit of Love” was her favorite book.</td>

      <td>The bank’s Archegos position is cleared, but more needs to be done to persuade investors that lender is on stable footing</td>
      <td>Credit Suisse  has now taken the full financial hit for the bank’s exposure to collapsed family office Archegos. It may be just starting to feel the operational and cultural impact.<br />In the latest quarter, the bank lost another $600 million closing out its final positions related to Archegos, taking its total losses on the trades to $5 billion. The Swiss bank has been massively reducing its risk profile, leading to disappointing second-quarter results. Risk-weighted assets were cut by $20 billion and leverage exposure by $41 billion, mostly in its investment bank.<br />Credit Suisse also published a scathing 172-page independent report into its dealings with Archegos that called out “persistent failures” to manage flagged risks and “pervasive issues of business competence.” The bank had already made some of the changes the report recommended, including changing key leaders, moving all hedge funds to dynamic margins and strengthening existing risk processes.<br />Among the personnel changes, Credit Suisse has hired a chief risk officer from  Goldman Sachs  to do the slow, hard work of reforming the risk culture. The bank also fired nine employees and clawed back about $70 million in compensation from 23 people—implying it paid at least $3 million each to the couple of dozen people who cost it $5 billion.<br />The report will make juicy reading for regulators around the globe who also are looking into Archegos’s collapse. Their findings are to come. Credit Suisse could face fines or other sanctions and there are likely to be some marketwide changes, too.</td>

      <td>Profit upgrades are coming thick and fast from car manufacturers, even as they talk of little else but reinventing the wheel.<br />Ford ,   Volkswagen  and  Nissan  have all published strong quarterly earnings and upped their full-year forecasts over the past two days. The common theme, which is likely to run through reports from GM and Stellantis next week, has been unusually high margins due to inflation in vehicle prices and a profitable mix of sales. The continuing semiconductor shortage has restricted the usual competition between dealers and forced manufacturers to prioritize more profitable models.<br />The obvious question for investors is whether these conditions—benign for manufacturers, less so for consumers—can last. The simple answer is almost certainly no, but there are elements car makers might be able to hold on to as they rethink their relationship with consumers.<br />Both Ford and Volkswagen made reassuring noises about retaining pricing discipline even after the scarcity of microchips, and hence cars, eases. But this is easier said than done. The industry has historically suffered from spare factory capacity that manufacturers have every incentive to fill. The result is typically excessive inventories, whether on dealer lots (for U.S. car makers) or on company balance sheets (for German ones) that make it hard to resist discounting.<br />Spare capacity is likely to get worse as manufacturers spend billions of dollars on ramping up output of electric vehicles. Some are starting to talk about winding down their gas-engine assets, but nobody knows how fast consumers will embrace EVs. Flexibility will be needed, which implies excess production capacity in one technology or the other. Maintaining pricing discipline in such an environment seems like a fantasy.</td>

      <td>The Sacred Band of Thebes, a Greek military unit composed of male couples, inspired modern crusaders for gay rights.</td>
      <td>The names of Gorgidas and Pammenes are little known even to readers familiar with ancient Greece. But in 378 B.C., these leaders of the city of Thebes created an institution that would inspire the modern struggle for gay rights more than 2,000 years later. The Sacred Band was a military unit made up of 150 pairs of male lovers, founded on the principle that couples fighting side by side would be inspired with special courage. As one Theban strategist put it, “Eros is the only general that’s never been beaten.”<br />In the 19th century, the story of the Band’s victories, sometimes against foes that outnumbered them two to one, inspired gay writers to imagine a world where male couples could become leaders and heroes—a “city of manly love,” Walt Whitman wrote in “Leaves of Grass,” that would be “invincible to the attacks of the whole of the rest of the earth.”<br />In creating the Sacred Band as a weapon against Sparta, the Thebans drew on local tradition. According to myth, the city was the birthplace of the god Heracles—Hercules to the Romans—who fought battles alongside a kinsman named Iolaus. The tomb of Iolaus at Thebes had become a kind of shrine at which male couples would pledge themselves to each other. Such pledges of love, perhaps signifying life-long and exclusive commitments—in effect, same-sex marriages—were unique to Thebes. In the “Symposium,” Plato calls such unions Uranian or “heavenly”—a term embraced by the first gay men to come out of the closet in 19th-century Europe.<br />The Band would remain undefeated for 40 years until Alexander the Great wiped it out in the Battle of Chaeronea, in central Greece, in 338 B.C. The destruction was mourned by Alexander’s father, King Philip of Macedon, though he had laid out the battle plans and no doubt ordered that no quarter be given. He reportedly wept at the sight of the heap of corpses and cursed any man who cast ill repute on their same-sex unions. Then he allowed the Thebans to bury them in a mass grave on the battlefield where they were laid out in phalanx formation, as though standing ready for combat, with lovers side by side for eternity.<br />Some years later the grave was memorialized by a remarkable marble lion, depicted in a crouching position, with its head turned to gaze at the field where the Band had perished. The Lion of Chaeronea stood intact for centuries, but eventually it broke up and disappeared into the soil. A single protruding stone led to its rediscovery in 1818, when a British traveler’s horse stumbled over it. Some six decades later, in 1880, the mass grave beneath it was discovered, containing the remains of 254 of the Band’s 300 members; some of the pairs of warriors were interred with linked arms.</td>

Both wines are made from Sauvignon Blanc and grown in the upper Loire Valley of France, but while Sancerre is a star, Pouilly-Fumé has largely faded from view, at least stateside. Most wine shops I visited didn’t have a single Fumé on their shelves.<br />Fifty years ago, Pouilly-Fumé was so famous and sought-after that American wine trailblazer Robert Mondavi co-opted part of its name for his own (California) Sauvignon Blanc. The Robert Mondavi Fumé Blanc was wildly successful and inspired numerous domestic wineries to follow suit. But by the 1980s French Fumé began to languish as Sancerre started to soar.<br />The soils of Pouilly-Fumé and Sancerre are fairly similar: Both are based on limestone and clay, and the wines grown in the two places are often said to taste fairly similar, too. As Jancis Robinson and Hugh Johnson noted in the 8th edition of “The World Atlas of Wine,” “It would be a brave taster who maintained he or she could always tell a Pouilly-Fumé from a Sancerre. The best of each are on the same level....”<br />Since the two wines are admittedly so much alike, I wondered: Why did one take the world by storm while the other pretty much fell off the map? And are the Pouilly-Fumés findable in U.S. wine stores today actually worth the search?<br />I posed the first question to winemaker Karine Lauverjat, who makes very good Sancerre and Pouilly-Fumé as well as a few other wines with her husband, Christian Lauverjat, in their Sancerre-based winery. “There was a huge media promotion on Sancerre, and now it’s a ‘do not miss’ place to visit with its hillside plateau, historic town center and beautiful views,” she wrote in an email. “You could even say that Sancerre has become the most popular town of France.”</td>

      <td>China’s CATL, a Tesla supplier, says cheaper element could lower vehicle cost</td>
      <td>TOKYO— Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. , the world’s biggest maker of electric-vehicle batteries and a  Tesla Inc.  supplier, said it was looking to make batteries using sodium ions, a technology that could reduce costs and lift performance.<br />CATL is the first battery maker in the top global tier to adopt sodium-based battery technology, which offers promise because sodium is relatively plentiful and cheap. Other major players in the automotive business such as  Panasonic Corp.  and  LG Chem Ltd.  have focused on improving battery recipes that rely on less easily mined elements such as lithium, cobalt and nickel.<br />Commercializing sodium-based batteries still faces challenges. CATL said the energy density of its new battery—the amount of energy it stores per unit of volume—is lower than that of an EV battery widely used in China known as lithium ferrophosphate.<br />Companies are racing to bring down the cost of making an electric vehicle so that it matches traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. UBS Group AG has calculated that electric-vehicle battery packs and motors cost $4,000 more to manufacture than a comparable gasoline-burning midsize sedan engine, a difference it believes will disappear by mid-decade.<br />CATL’s market capitalization has climbed sharply this year and stands at about $200 billion, according to FactSet, making it one of China’s most valuable companies. Investors have bought the battery maker on optimism over the EV wave. It supplies EV makers such as Tesla, Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz unit and Chinese car makers.</td>

      <td>Spirits companies like Diageo are better equipped to manage a spike in input costs than brewer AB InBev and other consumer staples giants</td>
      <td>Liquor companies are taking inflation in their stride. A push into premium brands, coupled with the fact that more drinkers are switching to spirits from beer in key markets, should help maintain their edge.<br />Johnnie Walker distiller  Diageo ,  Budweiser brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev and Swiss food giant  Nestlé  beat analysts’ sales expectations across the board in results reported Thursday. But the ability of these big consumer-goods companies to protect profit margins from cost inflation has been mixed.<br />Liquor specialists seem to be performing the best. Diageo expects to grow its margins in the financial year through next June, despite higher costs for commodities, shipping and packaging. Analysts also increased profit expectations for Italian competitor  Davide Campari-Milano ,  the maker of brands such as Aperol and Grand Marnier, after it released strong results earlier this week.<br />Meanwhile,  AB InBev ’s  shares fell 6% in morning trading Thursday, in part because the brewer wasn’t able to pass on all of its higher costs to drinkers in North America, its most important market. Operating profit margins in the region fell 2.8 percentage points to 37.6% in the second quarter compared with the same period of 2020. Beer has been losing market share to spirits in the U.S. for years, but the trend picked up during the Covid-19 pandemic. This leaves brewers on a weaker footing when they need to increase prices.<br />Liquor companies’ big push into more expensive brands in recent years also gives them an advantage, as wealthier drinkers are less sensitive to price increases. Premium drinks now account for 38% of Diageo’s total liquor retail sales, according to IWSR data, up from 34% in 2015. AB InBev also is growing its high-end beer business, but these brands generate a lower proportion of the company’s overall revenue—around 30% at the latest count.</td>

The toys that arrive in time will likely carry higher prices.<br />Hasbro Inc.,   Mattel Inc.  and other manufacturers say they are navigating supply-chain disruptions and rising costs for materials and labor, leading them to raise prices to recoup some of the added costs.<br />Toy industry veterans say this year’s disruption is worse than last year when the Covid-19 outbreak temporarily shut many ports, factories and stores. “In 2020, we thought it couldn’t get any worse, and 2021 said, ‘Hold my beer,’” said Joshua Loerzel, vice president of sales and marketing for Hog Wild LLC, a small toy company based in Oregon.<br />Ocean freight bottlenecks have led to long delays for shipping from China, where a majority of toys sold in the U.S. are made, and rates that are far higher than usual. The daily spot rate including premium surcharges for a 40-foot container from China to the U.S. West Coast as of Wednesday was $18,346, compared with about $2,680 last July and $1,550 in July 2019, according to the Freightos Baltic Index.<br />Hasbro, which outsources nearly all its production, says the company is using various ports and shipping lanes and sourcing more of its toys from various countries to avoid delays during the second half of the year. “I’m going to be a little less focused on exactly where the inventory is coming in, but rather that we have the inventories to meet the demand,” Hasbro CEO Brian Goldner told analysts this week.</td>

      <td>Plaintiffs’ lawyers say it would take $1 billion to fairly compensate victims of Champlain Towers South and families, but the pool of insurance money is limited</td>
      <td>Plaintiffs’ lawyers have filed some two dozen lawsuits following the collapse of the Champlain Towers South condo tower last month, seeking payouts for the 98 deaths and destruction of 136 apartments it caused. The lawyers say it would take $1 billion to compensate everyone fairly.<br />But the pool of money currently available for the Miami-area disaster is far smaller—some $50 million from insurance policies in place for the condo association, according to attorneys and court filings. The shortfall is so significant that the potential settlement might not even be enough to cover some residents for the value of their lost units, said Brad Sohn, one of the plaintiffs attorneys appointed by the court to lead the litigation.<br />Already, the limited pool of funds is pitting Champlain Tower residents who suffered only property damage against those who lost loved ones or suffered injuries that could have long-term consequences.<br />The insurance “will obviously be inadequate to compensate everyone fully to the extent of their horror,” Judge Michael Hanzman of the 11th Judicial Circuit of Florida said at an early hearing. “There’s going to be a very serious allocation issue between those people who tragically lost loved ones and were lucky enough to only lose property.”<br />The Champlain Towers South litigation is constrained by a conservative property-insurance policy and a push by the judge to resolve the lawsuits on an accelerated timeline. The main defendant isn’t a multinational corporation or a wealthy developer but the condo board, a nonprofit with limited financial resources.</td>

      <td>Tunisia, the country whose protest movement promised to transform the Middle East a decade ago, is in turmoil after its president suspended parliament and seized executive power this week, stirring concerns that the only democracy to emerge from the Arab Spring uprisings is slipping back to autocracy.<br />The crisis is threatening to strike a blow against democratic aspirations across the region, and while many Tunisians support the removal of an unpopular government, others fear the country could lose its status as North Africa’s sole exemplar of democracy after street rallies overthrew a dictator in 2011. Egypt’s brief period of democracy ended in a military coup in 2013. Libya, Syria, and Yemen plunged into war.<br />“It means that we are not different, maybe,” said Messaoud Romdhani, a Tunisian activist and political analyst who sits on the board of Euromed Rights, a regional network of human rights groups. “It means the only success story has come back to the group.”<br />President Kais Saied fired top government ministers and sent troops to stop lawmakers from entering the parliament building Monday, after months of antigovernment protests over a faltering economy and a Covid-19 outbreak that pushed hospitals to the brink. On Monday, he imposed a ban on gatherings of three or more people that largely halted protests.<br />Top political leaders, including the speaker of the parliament, Rached Ghannouchi, have accused Mr. Saied of launching a coup. Mr. Saied has rejected that, saying the constitution gives him emergency powers. Mr. Ghannouchi has said he wasn’t consulted on the moves, which would render them unconstitutional.

Far fewer people fell sick than in the West, meaning less natural immunity, and less than 20% of the population in most Asian countries has been fully vaccinated, according to Oxford Economics.<br />That is less than half the vaccination rates in the U.S. and U.K., where uncontrolled early outbreaks prompted the authorities to bet aggressively on vaccines. It is also far short of the 60% to 70% threshold once viewed as the target to reach herd immunity—and even further from the higher percentage some public-health experts estimate would now be needed because of Delta’s transmissibility.</td>

A take-private deal that would involve a tender offer for its publicly traded shares is one of the preliminary options being considered, they added.<br />Didi raised about $4.4 billion in its initial public offering after selling American depositary shares at $14 apiece, in the biggest stock sale by a Chinese company since the 2014 blockbuster listing of  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.<br />Its shares briefly topped $18 in their first days of trading, before the Cyberspace Administration of China stunned investors and the company on July 2 by launching a data-security probe into Didi and blocking its China business from adding new users. Two days later, the cybersecurity regulator told app-store operators to take down the company’s popular Chinese mobile app.<br />The crackdown worsened on July 9, when 25 more Didi apps—including ones used by drivers—were ordered to be removed from app stores, potentially crippling the company’s operations. China also said in early July that it would tighten rules for companies selling shares abroad, signaling its displeasure with recent listings by Didi and others.</td>

For months, it has been one of the world’s best known, too, after its bow wedged into the Suez Canal’s eastern bank and its stern swung around and planted itself into the other side—blocking traffic in both directions.<br />It arrived at a Rotterdam container terminal early Thursday.<br />The ship originally set sail from Yantian, China, on March 8. It got stuck in the Suez Canal on March 23, where it spent a week, closing the crucial waterway that connects the Mediterranean and Red Seas. The passage accounts for as much as 13% of seaborne trade. A global shipping traffic jam ensued, with vessels anchoring on either side of the waterway. Other ships rerouted around the canal entirely.<br />A multinational team of some 600 engineers and sailors and a flotilla of the world’s biggest tug boats dug, then pulled, the Ever Given free. The ship then sat for months at anchor in a lake off the main Suez channel while its owner and insurers negotiated with Egyptian authorities over liability and compensation.</td>

      <td>Carlyle Group Inc .  reported sharply higher second-quarter earnings as growth in the value of its private-equity portfolio outpaced the broader market.<br />The Washington, D.C., buyout firm reported a second-quarter net income of $925 million, or $2.55 a share. That compares with net income of $145.9 million, or 41 cents, in the same period last year.<br />The firm’s private-equity portfolio appreciated by 12% during the second quarter, besting the roughly 8% gain for the S&P 500. Carlyle’s net accrued performance revenues—a reflection of how its investments are faring and a closely watched gauge of future earnings—hit a record $4 billion during the quarter.<br />Carlyle’s second-quarter distributable earnings, or the portion of profits that could be returned to shareholders, came in at $395.4 million, or 88 cents a share. That compares with $198.4 million, or 53 cents a share a year earlier.<br />Carlyle and its peers—known for splashy leveraged buyouts but which also engage in all manner of investing activity—have benefited from rising markets as economies around the world emerge from coronavirus-related lockdowns.</td>

From early May to July 17, filings for benefits have dropped by more than 17%, though they remain elevated from their pre-pandemic level. The four-week moving average, which smooths out volatility in the weekly figures, was slightly above its pandemic low last week.<br />The labor market and overall economy are expected to continue recovering from a sharp downturn earlier in the pandemic. Economists cite uncertainty from the Delta variant of Covid-19, continuing supply-chain constraints and a shortage of available workers as factors to watch regarding the outlook.<br />“I do expect to see job growth pick up, but I’m not sure how and when these issues are going to be resolved and how households are going to respond,” said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics.<br />Employers added 850,000 jobs in June, the most in 10 months, and workers’ wages increased.

      <td>The U.S. economy likely exceeded its pre-pandemic peak in the second quarter as reopenings and government aid powered a growth surge that is expected to gradually slow in coming months, with Covid-19 variants and materials and labor disruptions clouding the outlook.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimate that gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services made in the U.S., grew at an 8.4% annual rate in the April-to-June period, compared with 6.4% in the prior quarter. That would mark the second-fastest pace since 1983, exceeded only by last summer’s rapid rebound from spring pandemic-related lockdowns. The Commerce Department will release its estimate of second-quarter GDP on Thursday morning.<br />Such growth would also propel GDP beyond pre-pandemic levels, a milestone that underscores the speed of the recovery that began last summer. Widespread business reopenings, vaccinations and a big infusion of government pandemic aid this spring helped propel rapid gains in consumer spending, the economy’s main driver.<br />“The economy has come roaring back faster than people expected,” said Jay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo Corporate and Investment Bank.<br />Economists expect growth to remain strong, fueled by job gains, pent-up savings and continued fiscal support. Still, many say growth likely peaked in the second quarter and will cool as the initial boost from reopenings and fiscal stimulus fades.</td>

      <td>Korean technology giant  Samsung Electronics  is cashing in on its memory chips. The boom may not last forever but its leading technology position should help it weather slower times well too.<br />The world’s largest smartphone and memory-chip maker said Thursday that its operating profit for the three months ended in June rose 54% from a year earlier to the highest level since 2018. That’s against a low base last year, but its operating profit grew from the previous quarter too, by 34%. A one-off gain from Samsung’s display segment—likely a guaranteed payment from  Apple —helped. But the company’s semiconductor division was the main profit driver. Operating profit there more than doubled from a quarter earlier.<br />The chip shortage continues to help. Samsung not only sold more memory chips, but at higher prices. Component shortages, however, have hit the firm’s handset sales downstream.<br />Investors are already looking past the stellar quarter to the future: Samsung’s shares have lost 13% since January, partly reversing last year’s 45% gains. The main concern is whether the momentum of memory demand will continue. The component shortage could also further hurt end demand as manufacturers find it hard to ramp up production. Apple warned this week that supply constraints could hurt iPhone and iPad sales.<br />Work-from-home demand for personal computers may also start to fade as more people get vaccinated against Covid-19. And many manufacturers may have built big memory-chip inventories, which could presage a hangover down the road.</td>

The second-quarter loss Thursday brings the total reported loss from the shot this year to about $53 million.<br />Shares fell 0.8% on the second-quarter profit decline.</td>

Brian Nelson was nominated to be the Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, and Elizabeth Rosenburg was tapped for the assistant secretary for terrorism financing post. Both positions are national security roles critical to implementing U.S. foreign policy through leverage of the dollar’s unparalleled power as the world’s reserve currency. The two have appeared before the committee, but a vote on their nominations hasn’t been scheduled.<br />The senators, in a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, said they would continue to block the nominations so long as the administration chose not to impose sanctions against the project, or until it “adequately addresses the absence of penalties.”<br />“We urge you to reverse course on Nord Stream 2 and join us in Congress’s longstanding defense of European allies and partners from malign Russian aggression,” the lawmakers said.</td>

      <td>OTTAWA—The local police force that serves an Ontario First Nation community is launching a criminal investigation into the deaths of students at a former boarding school for indigenous children, the community’s elected chief said.<br />Six Nations of the Grand River Chief Mark Hill said the Six Nations Police Service informed him that it plans to investigate incidents of abuse and deaths of students, after a request last week from a group of survivors who attended the school when they were children. Chief Hill said the survivors wanted to get police involved to ensure that evidence is preserved and records about the school, which operated from 1832 to 1970, can be obtained quickly.<br />“We really wanted to protect things on the front end. We didn’t want to risk the potential compromise of any evidence,” he said.<br />The planned investigation comes after the discovery in recent months of hundreds of unmarked graves near former boarding schools for indigenous children in Western Canada. The Tk’emlúps te Secwépemc community near Kamloops, British Columbia, said in late May that it had identified the location of 215 unmarked graves near the Kamloops Indian Residential School. Since then, at least three more communities have come forward with information about unmarked graves near former residential schools, bringing the total number found in recent months to well over 1,000.<br />Six Nations Police Service didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on the investigation at the Mohawk Institute, a former residential school in Ontario. However, two other police forces said Six Nations police had requested their assistance. The Ontario Provincial Police said it was reviewing a request for help investigating incidents of abuse and deaths at the school and with locating unmarked graves, and municipal police in the city of Brantford, which borders Six Nations of the Grand River territory, said they were holding discussions on how to proceed.</td>

      <td>Investing platform’s IPO is expected to start trading Thursday in highly anticipated deal</td>
      <td>Robinhood Markets Inc. priced its initial public offering at $38 a share, at the low end of expectations, after the popular trading platform met tepid demand for its highly anticipated debut.<br />The price chosen by the company and its underwriters is at the bottom of the range of $38 to $42 a share they had been targeting. It pegs Robinhood’s valuation at about $32 billion, far higher than the nearly $12 billion it fetched in a funding round a year ago but below the lofty prior expectations of some investors and bankers.<br />Robinhood has said it and some executives would sell 55 million shares, so the offering should yield more than $2 billion.<br />The price reflects both hesitation on the part of some investors, who bristled at what they saw as the high valuation Robinhood sought, as well as a conscious decision by the company and its underwriters to be conservative in order to help set up a successful first-day of trading, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Next up for Robinhood is its trading debut, which the company will make Thursday on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the symbol HOOD. It is a markedly different debut than the traditional IPO. While most companies only allocate a small amount of stock to individual investors at the time of their IPOs, Robinhood sold a big chunk of its IPO shares to individual investors over its new platform that gives users access to IPOs before they start trading.</td>

      <td>The Senate voted Wednesday to advance a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure package, which includes about $550 billion above projected federal spending on roads, bridges, expanded broadband access and more.<br />A bipartisan group of 10 senators worked for weeks to come to an agreement on the details, which they announced earlier Wednesday. The Biden White House has signed off on the package. GOP lawmakers involved in the talks said they were confident it would win the support of at least 10 Republicans, a key threshold to reach the 60 votes necessary for advancing the deal.<br />Here’s what’s in the bipartisan agreement, and what comes next.<br />According to the White House, the bill will include $110 billion in funding for roads, bridges and major projects, as well as $39 billion to modernize and make public transit more accessible to the disabled and elderly. The deal also includes a $66 billion investment in rail maintenance, modernization and expansion. The legislation will provide $11 billion in funding for highway and pedestrian safety programs. A total of $7.5 billion will go to implementing a network of electric vehicle chargers, and another $7.5 billion will be used for zero-emission or low-emission buses and ferries. Ports and airports will be boosted with $42 billion in new spending.<br />The group agreed to spend $50 billion to bolster the country’s infrastructure generally against climate change and cyberattacks. Another $55 billion will go toward clean drinking water and $65 billion will go toward broadband infrastructure and development. The deal invests $21 billion in removing pollution from soil and groundwater, job creation in energy communities and a focus on economic and environmental justice. The legislation will include $73 billion to update and expand the power grid.</td>

      <td>Auto maker expects vehicle production, hit hard by the global chip shortage, to recover in the second half of the year</td>
      <td>Ford Motor Co.  posted a surprise second-quarter profit and raised its earnings outlook for the year, saying it sees an easing to the computer-chip shortage that has hampered vehicle output for months.<br />Ford said it expects to boost deliveries to dealerships globally by 30% during the second half of the year, which should bolster the bottom line despite the sting of rising commodity costs. The chip shortage prompted Ford to slash in half its second-quarter production plans, to about 700,000 vehicles.<br />Still, Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley called the chip-shortage situation fluid.  Tesla Inc.,   Volkswagen AG  and  Apple Inc.  recently warned that the shortage could continue to disrupt production in the months ahead.<br />Ford has been especially hard-hit by the computer-chip shortage that has curtailed global auto manufacturing since January. Company executives have pointed to the fallout from a fire at a key chip maker in Japan in March, which exacerbated the problem for many of its suppliers.<br />On Wednesday, Ford’s finance chief John Lawler said he sees the chip shortage improving during the third quarter, which should allow Ford to clear a backlog of orders for new vehicles, including the electric Mustang Mach-E sport-utility vehicle and a new Bronco SUV that is just entering production.</td>

      <td>If you bet on the central bank’s price forecasts, you lost.</td>
      <td>The Federal Reserve employs hundreds of economists whose job is assessing the American economy. So it is remarkable that the Fed is so wrong so often in its economic forecasts. The latest big miss has been its failure to anticipate this year’s surge in consumer prices.<br />Fed Chairman Jerome Powell conceded at his press conference Wednesday that prices had caught the central bank by surprise, but he showed no particular concern. The Federal Open Market Committee’s statement Wednesday after its two-day meeting also showed little interest in reeling in what has been the most reckless monetary policy since Arthur Burns roamed the Eccles Building. History hasn’t been kind to Burns.<br />Let’s compare actual inflation with the Fed’s forecasts. The nearby chart shows the estimates of inflation by Fed officials for 2021 and price increases this year. Fed governors and regional bank presidents offer their economic estimates of growth, unemployment, inflation and interest rates each quarter. The chart shows the median estimate of the Fed forecasters from June 2020 to last month for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator, the Fed’s favorite price index.<br />Note that through December 2020 Fed officials assumed PCE inflation this year of 1.8%. By March they had bumped that up to 2.4% as price pressures were already being felt. In June the median had climbed to 3.4%.<br />Yet even that catch-up drill underestimated the price surge. The PCE index had already climbed 3.6% in April from a year ago and 3.9% in May; the June figure will be out Friday.</td>

      <td>As the Jan. 6 committee meets, politics drowns out the actual story.</td>
      <td>The House inquiry on the events of Jan. 6 held its opening hearing Tuesday, and it showed why no Republican should try to brush aside the ugliness of the Capitol riot. The perpetrators who assaulted police that day weren’t overenthusiastic tourists, and the mob was not all a “loving crowd,” as Donald Trump characterized the audience for his pre-melee speech.<br />“What we were subjected to that day was like something from a medieval battle. We fought hand to hand, inch by inch, to prevent an invasion of the Capitol,” police officer Aquilino Gonell testified. “I could feel myself losing oxygen and recall thinking to myself, ‘This is how I’m going to die, defending this entrance.’” He has already had a surgery on his injured foot, he said. He needs another one on his shoulder.<br />Officer Michael Fanone, who was pulled into the crowd, said he was “grabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country.” One attacker “lunged for me and attempted to remove my firearm.” On the body camera footage, he yells a plea: “I’ve got kids!” He was eventually diagnosed with a heart attack, a concussion and a traumatic brain injury.<br />Republicans are focused on why the Capitol was so badly protected on Jan. 6, which is a good question, and if Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s committee wants to be taken seriously, it should examine that in detail. But here’s what the No. 3 House Republican, Elise Stefanik, told the press before Tuesday’s hearing: “The American people deserve to know the truth: that Nancy Pelosi bears responsibility, as Speaker of the House, for the tragedy that occurred on Jan. 6.”<br />What kind of voter is this supposed to convince? Security oversights in the run-up to the riot are fair game, but it’s hardly credible to point to them alone, without acknowledging that President Trump urged his supporters to stop the supposed steal. On Jan. 6 some of them took his words seriously, literally, or both, and Mr. Trump dallied instead of rushing to Congress’s defense. The GOP would be better off ceding weak ground by admitting that the election wasn’t stolen and Mr. Trump was wrong.</td>

      <td>A new McKinsey study documents the severe student learning loss.</td>
      <td>Shutting down schools was among the most destructive policies of the pandemic, and a new report by McKinsey & Co. quantifies the harm.<br />The consulting firm examined spring 2021 test results for 1.6 million students in grades 1 through 6 across the U.S., then compared their performance with that of similar students pre-pandemic. They discovered that the pandemic-era children were, on average, about four months behind in reading and five months behind in math.<br />However bleak, these numbers “likely represent an optimistic scenario,” McKinsey says. The results measure “outcomes for students who took interim assessments in the spring in a school building—and thus exclude students who remained remote throughout the entire school year, and who may have experienced the most disruption to their schooling.”<br />The McKinsey study doesn’t say it, but teachers unions were the main architects of this calamity by first refusing to return to the classroom, then insisting on watered-down schedules. The data company Burbio found that, by the end of the spring semester, most students could attend school at least part-time. But due to union demands, the return sometimes amounted to a few days or hours of in-person learning a week.<br />McKinsey found that children in majority black schools ended the school year a full six months behind in math and reading on average. Students in schools where the average household income was below $25,000 were seven months behind in math and six months in reading.</td>

      <td>The mayor promises to focus on quality-of-life issues. Seriously.</td>
      <td>Bill de Blasio has rediscovered “broken windows,” the idea that tolerating little disorders such as broken windows in abandoned buildings will eventually lead to larger disorder. This was the gist of the New York mayor’s answer Tuesday to a question about the illegal drinking, pot smoking and other behavior that has contributed to the mayhem in Washington Square Park.<br />“There’s more to do in making sure that we set the right parameters, but right now our focus has been bringing this city back, addressing the most serious concerns, and then more and more, we’re starting to be able to focus on the quality-of-life concerns as well,” the mayor told reporters.<br />Mr. de Blasio’s promise to “focus” on quality-of-life is welcome. But it comes with barely five months left in his eight-year tenure, and after years of a very different message. Long before George Floyd and the defund-the-police movement, Mr. de Blasio won office with an anti-cop campaign—and last summer he cut police funding by $1 billion. When the City Council passed a bill that encouraged police to end arrests for quality-of-life offenses such as public drinking or public urination, he signed it. On his watch, city district attorneys decided not to prosecute certain misdemeanor offenses.<br />The results have been predictable. In September more than 160 CEOs of some of the city’s most prominent businesses warned that concerns about security and livability threaten New York’s post-Covid 19 recovery. “There is widespread anxiety over public safety, cleanliness and other quality of life issues that are contributing to deteriorating conditions in commercial districts and neighborhoods across the five boroughs,” they wrote.<br />Broken windows policing transformed New York from a crime-ridden metropolis to what it was when Mr. de Blasio was elected: the safest big city in America. It’s too late for Mr. de Blasio to do anything about the decline in public safety and order, but it’s not too late for the next mayor to learn from his mistakes.</td>
