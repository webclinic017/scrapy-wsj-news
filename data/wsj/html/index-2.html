If we do that, we’re confident we can maintain our strong position and continue to grow nicely as we have been for the past two-plus decades.” Netflix said.</td>

      <td>Streaming giant confirms interest in videogames as subscriber growth remains mired in post-pandemic slump</td>
      <td>It is as good a time as any for  Netflix  to test a new story line. Even a lucky turn in videogames won’t free the streaming giant from the need to keep playing Hollywood’s game, though.<br />Netflix used its second-quarter report Tuesday afternoon to confirm previously reported plans to enter the videogame business. No timing was given, though the company said the offerings would be included in its current subscription plans at no additional cost. The company isn’t backing away from its work on movies and TV shows, but said in its letter to shareholders “since we are nearly a decade into our push into original programming, we think the time is right to learn more about how our members value games.”<br />That news comes as Netflix remains mired in somewhat of a post-pandemic slump. It added 1.5 million net new paying subscribers in the second quarter, which was a bit better than it had forecast but still its lowest level of growth in nearly a decade. It also projected 3.5 million net adds for the third quarter—about 29% less than what Wall Street was hoping for. That would bring the total number of new subscribers to about nine million for the first nine months of 2021. Netflix added more than 28 million paying subscribers in the same period last year.<br />A foray into games might make sense for a company with an intimate knowledge of the viewing habits of a user base that now numbers over 209 million. It is also a tough business to crack—even the mobile gaming market that Netflix says it expects to target initially. There are many participants, but most of the money is still made by long-established properties. Games like “Candy Crush” and “Clash of Clans” remain in the top-five grossing charts even after nearly a decade on the market.<br />Netflix will need to keep battling it out for video streaming eyeballs. The company expects its pace of new releases to pick up in the second half of this year; analysts from Wedbush count 42 original shows and movies expected for the third quarter alone. But the company still has its own track record to compete with: Last fall included popular shows such as “The Queen’s Gambit,” “The Crown” and “Bridgerton.” Netflix shares are down nearly 2% this year, lagging behind many internet and entertainment peers. Streaming investors hyper-focused on subscriber growth aren’t playing games.</td>

      <td>Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson get a thrill, but they’re also pushing flight forward.</td>
      <td>The richest man on Earth briefly lost that title Tuesday morning, but only because for a few floaty minutes he was no longer on Earth. Jeff Bezos has spent two decades using his  Amazon  wealth to underwrite a rocket venture, Blue Origin. On Tuesday the company launched its first manned flight to space, with Mr. Bezos strapped on board the capsule.<br />After riding the New Shepard rocket to Mach 3, experiencing weightlessness, and parachuting back to the Texas desert, Mr. Bezos thanked the engineers and crew, along with “every Amazon employee and every Amazon customer, because you guys paid for all this.”<br />It’s easy to dismiss this as a joy ride, which in part it was, or as the indulgence of a rich man with attention-deficit disorder. But as billionaires’ hobbies go, this is more productive than, well, owning the Washington Post. “The architecture and the technology we have chosen,” Mr. Bezos said, “is complete overkill for a suborbital tourism mission.” That’s because the mission isn’t limited to expensive thrills.<br />Tourism is merely the first rung of the space ladder. Blue Origin has two more manned flights on the schedule for this year, and Mr. Bezos said the company is approaching $100 million in private sales. Virgin Galactic has presold hundreds of tickets for its space plane, which flew its founder, Richard Branson, to weightlessness last week. Elon Musk’s SpaceX has ferried NASA astronauts to orbit, but it has private flights on the calendar, too.<br />It isn’t clear how big this tourism market will be, but the competition is clearly on, as Blue Origin brags that its capsule has bigger windows than the other guy’s. As these companies strive to outdo each other, costs will fall. Engineering advances, such as reusable rockets that land vertically, have already slashed the price of getting cargo to space.</td>

      <td>An independent analysis shows how Democrats are hiding their true spending plans.</td>
      <td>Democrats have provided few details of what they plan to include in Sen. Bernie Sanders’s $3.5 trillion budget proposal, and now we know why. The real cost is $5 trillion or more, according to an independent analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which keeps an eye on fiscal matters.<br />The budget-resolution fact sheet Democrats circulated last week includes only a bare-bones description of the bill’s major programs for tax credits, new entitlements, healthcare, climate and housing. Some categories include this revealing caveat: “The duration of each program’s enactment will be determined based on scoring and Committee input.”<br />That’s Washington-speak for admitting the budget will be built on phony assumptions and gimmicks. Democrats know their proposed tax hikes and dubious “pay-fors” won’t come close to fully funding “every major program that President Biden has asked us for”—as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer claimed.<br />Their plan is to include every program but start small and pretend they’re temporary. This will let them skirt the budget-reconciliation rule that spending can’t add to the deficit outside a 10-year budget window without triggering a 60-vote threshold to pass.<br />The nonprofit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget examined the budget outline and on Monday released a more honest analysis of the bill’s cost. Its estimate is based on Joe Biden’s fiscal 2022 budget proposal and legislation that Democrats have already proposed that will fill in the budget blanks later this year. Assuming the major provisions will be made permanent and continue through the 10-year budget window, the group says, the “policies under consideration could cost between $5 trillion and $5.5 trillion over a decade.”</td>

The Trump Administration fixed it with a proper rule-making. But here we go again as President Biden has nominated the same woman for the same job to impose the same standard of injustice.<br />The woman is Catherine Lhamon, who is Mr. Biden’s nominee to be assistant secretary for civil rights in the Education Department. That’s the same job she held in the Obama years, when she was the top enforcer of Title IX guidance for colleges. Because “a Title IX investigation will never result in incarceration of an individual,” Ms. Lhamon’s office told colleges in a 2014 Q&A, “the same procedural protections and legal standards” that govern criminal proceedings “are not required.” Tell that to a young person whose life can be permanently scarred by a false accusation.<br />Her directive “strongly” discouraged “a school from allowing the parties to personally question or cross-examine each other during a hearing on alleged sexual violence” because it “may be traumatic or intimidating” for the victim. The standard of guilt for the accused was merely a preponderance of evidence. Several accused students sued in federal court, and more than one judge faulted schools for lack of due process under the Obama guidance.<br />Betsy DeVos, the Trump education secretary, sought to restore some basic fairness to Title IX cases. Her rule in 2020, issued after ample time for public comment, included such due-process protections as the right of both parties to cross-examine witnesses and present and challenge evidence.<br />Ms. Lhamon claimed on  Twitter  at the time that the DeVos rule was a return “to the bad old days, that predate my birth, when it was permissible to rape and sexually harass students with impunity.” That was false even in the “bad old days,” and it’s false about the DeVos rule. But Ms. Lhamon was unapologetic in her Senate confirmation hearing. It’s a safe bet that, if confirmed, Ms. Lhamon would roll back the due process protections.</td>

      <td>The Bay Colonists thought salvation could be earned through good works. Anne Hutchinson loudly disagreed. Trouble ensued.</td>
      <td>How did a dispute within a small breakaway group of Protestants over a seemingly obscure point of theology become an iconic episode in American history? The issue was whether one could earn eternal salvation through godly behavior, or whether the gift of saving grace is bestowed without regard to a person’s conduct. To the side led by Anne Hutchinson, the difference was between a popish “covenant of works” and a true “covenant of grace.” To the other, headed by John Winthrop, “free grace” portended “antinomianism,” a world of free love and social disorder in which the laws of church and state did not apply to true believers.<br />The protagonists, as Marilyn J. Westerkamp shows in “The Passion of Anne Hutchinson,” (Oxford, 312 pages, $29.95) were worthy adversaries. Winthrop, the leader of the Great Puritan Migration to Massachusetts Bay, was the colony’s frequent governor and the man whose vision of a “city upon a hill” became the stuff of presidential speeches. Hutchinson (1591–1643), the daughter of a dissenting minister, was a charismatic matron with a reputation for piety. Caught in the middle was the Rev. John Cotton, a Cambridge-educated divine with a foot in each camp. Resonating through the centuries, the controversy plays out in the parties’ own voices in diaries and trial transcripts.<br />Hutchinson herself speaks to the modern interest in women’s history. Called by the scholar Michael Winship “the most famous—or infamous—English woman in colonial American history,” she has been cast as a martyr for religious freedom, a victim of the patriarchy, or a sacrifice to social order at a time when Massachusetts was threatened by belligerent Native Americans and a hostile Crown. She was a prophet, a Jezebel or both.<br />Hutchinson arrived in Boston, age 43, in September 1634, on board the same ship that a year earlier had brought her adored pastor, John Cotton, to the New World. Accompanying her was her husband, William, a successful cloth merchant, 10 of their 11 surviving children, and a handful of relatives and servants. The Hutchinsons joined their eldest son, who had already crossed the Atlantic with Cotton. Among the wealthiest émigrés, they received a house lot across the street from Winthrop, grazing rights on Taylor’s Island in the middle of Boston Harbor, and 600 acres of farmland near what later became Quincy. William soon became a town selectman and a member of the General Court. Anne became a sought-after midwife and herbalist, known for edifying religious counsel in the birthing room.<br />By 1636, Anne was holding weekly prayer meetings for women in her home. At first, the gatherings followed the English custom of female “conventicles,” but as Anne’s fame spread her constituency broadened to include men. Eventually Hutchinson presided over two “public lectures” each week, attended by 60 to 80 followers. Her message—an increasingly strident condemnation of all the local clergy except Cotton—only exacerbated her challenge to the standing order.</td>

      <td>The Fed should pay attention to Milton Friedman’s wisdom.</td>
      <td>June’s inflation index jumped 5.4% from a year ago, the highest reading since August 2008. The experts were surprised. Clearly, Federal Reserve watchers never bothered to consult Milton Friedman. Lost is a core Friedman dictum: “Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.”<br />In his Feb. 23 testimony to Congress, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the growth in the money supply, specifically M2, “doesn’t really have important implications.” The experts, the press and the bond vigilantes were as quick to unlearn monetarism, if they ever had learned it, as Mr. Powell. Reporting about U.S. inflation rarely contains the words “money supply.” We are repeatedly told that the most recent upticks in inflation are anomalous and “transitory.”<br />Wrong. The inflation upticks aren’t temporary and were predictable, driven by an extraordinary explosion in the money supply. Since March 2020, the M2 has been growing at an average annualized rate of 23.9%—the fastest since World War II. There is so much money out there that banks don’t know what to do with it. Via reverse repurchase agreements, banks and money-market funds are lending money to the Fed to the tune of $860 billion. That’s unprecedented.<br />According to monetarism, asset-price inflation should have occurred with a lag of one to nine months. Then, with a lag of six to 18 months, economic activity should have started to pick up. Lastly, after a lag of 12 to 24 months, generalized inflation should have set in. That’s the standard monetarist sequence, and it’s been followed to a T.<br />To get a handle on what the recent money supply explosion implies for inflation, consider a monetarist model for determining national income. That famous model was displayed on Milton Friedman’s California license plates. It’s compact: MV=Py, where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money (the speed at which it circulates), P is the price level, and y is real gross domestic product.</td>

      <td>The difficulty of the news business is that you’re constantly trying to tell people their information is outmoded, which they resist since assimilating new information entails a cost. And yet here goes:<br />If you haven’t had Covid yet, you will. If you’ve had it once, you’ll have it again. If you’re vaccinated or were infected previously—which will one day be most people except the very young—your symptoms will likely be mild or nonexistent, but it’s not guaranteed. Words the CDC says about the flu it will say about Covid: “Vaccination is especially important for people 65 years and older because they are at high risk of developing serious complications from flu. Flu vaccines are updated each season as needed to keep up with changing viruses.”<br />Nobody is surprised when they get the flu for the second, the third, the eighth time in their lives. This is what epidemiologists meant when, for the last 15 months, they said the new coronavirus was likely to evolve and become endemic.<br />Which brings us again to the question of vaccine hesitancy. Media types have been worshiping a Kaiser Family Foundation survey that finds 86% of Democrats and only 52% of Republicans are vaccinated.<br />But all the problems of polling apply: fewer and increasingly unrepresentative are those of us who even bother to answer our phones; we’re cagey on partisan questions. The numbers also seem disproportionate to every correlate: Rural vs. urban. Young vs. old. Black vs. white. Kaiser says it aims for an error of plus or minus 3 percentage points; on party identification it achieved an error of 6 to 7 points.</td>

      <td>The U.S. ‘doesn’t hide from our shortcomings.’ But we shouldn’t further authoritarian propaganda.</td>
      <td>The “Spring Festival Gala” is a nationwide television event in China, broadcast annually the eve of the lunar new year. The Economist magazine describes the show as “the most-watched television programme on Earth” and “one of the most vetted by the authorities.” The Communist Party reviews and approves everything in it.<br />In 2018, according to the Economist, the gala included a skit featuring a Chinese actress “in blackface and African dress, with exaggerated fake buttocks and a bowl of fruit on her head. For no clear reason, she had in tow a blackfaced Chinese man dressed as a monkey.”<br />Derogatory depictions of blacks that became taboo in the West generations ago remain commonplace in today’s China. A few years back, a horrified reader sent me a video of a Chinese commercial for laundry detergent. It featured a Chinese woman placing a detergent pod in the mouth of a black man and then shoving him into a washing machine. At the end of the cycle, a “clean” Asian man appears. The commercial had been appearing for months in China without incident until outraged viewers in the English-speaking world saw it and the video went viral. Within the country, however, “mostly the ad was met with apathy, perhaps because there is limited public debate about racism in China,” wrote Emma Graham-Harrison in the Guardian newspaper.<br />If these episodes shock the sensibilities of most people in the U.S., they haven’t deterred the Biden administration from tapping the likes of China to lecture Americans on our racial progress. Last week Secretary of State Antony Blinken invited officials from the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “systemic racism” in the U.S. This would be the same Human Rights Council whose membership includes not only China but also Russia and Cuba. Remarking on the decision, Mr. Blinken said that the U.S. doesn’t “hide from our shortcomings” and that this move will help “confront the scourge of racism, racial discrimination, and xenophobia.” If only.<br />These countries are not interested in any honest or objective scrutiny of America’s record on race—our Civil War to end slavery, our civil-rights movement to end Jim Crow, or how we twice elected a black man as president of a country that remains overwhelmingly white. It doesn’t matter to them that black Americans are far more prosperous than other black people. Or that, whatever our faults, very few blacks (or other racial and ethnic minorities) are trying to leave the U.S., while untold millions still want to migrate here.</td>

      <td>There will be dangerous consequences if Biden doesn’t respond strongly to the kidnapping plot.</td>
      <td>The foiled kidnapping plot against activist and journalist Masih Alinejad, an Iranian-born U.S. citizen living in New York City, has sparked a wave of outrage. The Justice Department’s indictment and detailed court documents indicate the Islamic Republic’s significant investment in the plot. The most troublesome part of this case, however, has been the Biden administration’s weak public response, which invites more malign behavior from Tehran.<br />Hundreds of dissidents have been threatened, kidnapped or assassinated since 1979, when the current regime rose to power in Iran. Since 2018, however, the Islamic Republic has carried out its campaign of terror with a new fervor. In 2019, Tehran lured, kidnapped and killed Ruhollah Zam, an Iranian dissident journalist residing in France. In July 2020, the Islamic Republic abducted Jamshid Sharmahd in Dubai and brought him to Iran, where he has been detained ever since. Mr. Sharmad is a lawful permanent resident of the U.S. The regime also abducted Habib Chaab, an Iranian-Swedish political activist, in October 2020.<br />Like other Iranian activists, the Brooklyn-based Ms. Alinejad has long faced threats for her opposition to the clerical regime. But attacking a U.S. citizen on American soil is something the Islamic Republic hasn’t attempted in more than four decades. Why now?<br />Iran, pressed to show its strength by the tide of discontent rising among its restive population, is likely taking these actions to send two messages. The first is to the Iranian people: No matter where you flee to, if you speak up, we will find you. This is at a time when antiregime protests are erupting in the country. The second and more important is meant for the U.S.: We will come after your people on your soil, spreading terror and brutality in the belief that, as the regime’s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, put it, “America can’t do a damn thing against us.”<br />So far, President Biden has proved Khomeini prescient. His cowed stance is dangerous not only for those residing within the U.S. but for liberty’s advocates all around the world. The plot to kidnap an American citizen from New York has thus far gone unrecognized and uncondemned by Mr. Biden. The one tweet that did come from Secretary of State Antony Blinken didn’t even name Iran as the perpetrator or mention that an American citizen had been threatened on U.S. soil.</td>

The Center seeks to make true the mission of the institution by serving students in the development of character, conscience, and social responsibility through racial identity development, cultural enrichment, social justice, and inclusion. . . .<br />The quote in question was chosen in concert with our Student Liaisons Advisory Board in early 2018. The Board, comprised of one representative (and one alternate) from each of the nine student organizations housed in the center and other invited cultural student organizations on campus, provides the PRCC senior staff with feedback on center programs and initiatives, insight on current campus/student issues, and serves as an assessment group to garner input for future program ideas and initiatives. While the quote was chosen for its recognition of and direction toward social progress, the draconian rule, harsh punishments, and resulting climate of fear within Cuba by the source of the quote, cannot be diminished. As our staff work toward critical reflection with our students, analyze social movements, and encourage freedom of thought, we too must be critical of ourselves and those we raise up. We must avoid actions that create an unwelcoming atmosphere in our space or our programs. For that reason, the quote has been removed and we will continue to work with our student liaisons and the tri-Caucus’ to identify a quote which expresses our intended messages of equity and justice.<br />We welcome conversations with those students impacted by this quote and will implement new processes to gather and engage community input regarding our facility, programs, and community engagement. The work of our Center is never done and forever evolves, and so must we.</td>

      <td>A show at the Morgan Library & Museum explores the efforts by the Pakistani-American artist to bring the aesthetic of centuries-old Indo-Persian manuscripts into dialogue with contemporary art and Western art history.</td>
      <td>New York<br />In 1989, Shahzia Sikander enrolled in the illuminated manuscript painting course at the National College of Arts in Lahore, Pakistan, her native city. The discipline was considered hopelessly outmoded, even stifling to creativity, but the 20-year-old aspiring young artist thought it offered possibilities. She mastered the tradition’s complex paper preparation, meticulous techniqueand conventions of representation, and employed and subverted them all in her thesis project, “The Scroll” (1989-90), five-plus feet of fractured, gorgeously patterned, obsessively detailed interiors informed equally by 16th- and 17th-century Safavid miniatures and by Cubism. The home is presented as the expected sphere for a Pakistani woman. In handsomely furnished rooms, servants crouch, sweep, wash floors, and prepare and present foodwhile the family relaxes. A young girl dressed in white appears multiple times, sometimes transparent and ghostly, always turned away. On the far right, she paints a portrait of an identical white-clad figure who poses in profile, her dark hair nearly obscuring her featureless face.<br />“The Scroll” is among the first images we encounter in “Shahzia Sikander: Extraordinary Realities,” a retrospective survey organized by the Rhode Island School of Design Museum and on view through Sept. 26 at New York’s Morgan Library & Museum. It announces the approach and many of the dominant themes that Ms. Sikander would continue to explore: perceptions of women, self-portraits, contemporary life and its inequities, the mythological and the fantastic—exquisitely rendered and filtered through snatches of Eastern and Western traditional art. As we move ahead to work made when Ms. Sikander pursued an MFA at RISD, followed by a residency at the Glassell School of Art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, between 1995 and 1997, we witness her experiments with a looser touch and bolder scale, and her development of a lexicon of ambiguous, anthropomorphic signs and symbols.<br />Paint becomes increasingly physical as Ms. Sikander’s work matures, enriching the rigorously clean surfaces of traditional miniature painting and sometimes canceling out fragile drawing. Carefully rendered images based on Safavid and Mughal prototypes are veiled by translucent watercolor, while tremulous, cascading lines of white paint suggest veils, imprisonment and more, triggering thoughts about restrictive societies and East/West conflicts. In “Who’s Veiled Anyway?” (1997), a polo player riding through a stylized landscape is almost obscured by a cage/veil of white lines. Ms. Sikander fragments figures, defies logical orientation and rational scale, provocatively forcing conflicting visual languages associated with different times and cultures to coexist in mysterious, loaded images, sometimes dissecting historical narratives for her own purposes. She turns the curling hair of the Gopis, the milkmaids devoted to Krishna, into a repeated floating glyph, for example.<br />Works such as the pale, luminous “Intimacy” (2001) are like supercharged art-history lessons. A nude Venus, precariously balanced on an antelope, seems to have ridden in from Bronzino’s 16th-century allegory “Venus, Cupid, Folly, and Time,” in London’s National Gallery. She reaches up to embrace a voluptuous Indian female deity, minimally outlined, while a sari-clad figure looks on, aided by a headless classicizing nude. Sinister birds, schematic architecture, hints of pattern, repeated dots and a wealth of delicate painting incidents keep us off balance, conjuring up different time periods, cultures, allusions and conceptions of what a painting can be. We’ve met the embracing women previously, in Sikander’s “Promiscuous Intimacies” (2020), a large patinated bronze sculpture outside the entrance to the show. Confronted by the painting, we realize how crucial Ms. Sikander’s hand and intimate scale are to the resonance of the image.</td>

      <td>Da’Vine Joy Randolph, John C. Reilly, Kristen Bell and Tom Waits are just some of the stars who lend their voices to AMC’s new noir-themed, stop-motion animation series.</td>
      <td>The stop-motion animated series “Ultra City Smiths” isn’t without a certain weird charm, though it is one that defies conventional reasoning. The series is an homage to film noir, a film movement, or moment, that wasn’t just about hard lighting and hair triggers, but flawed people—tormented heroes, compromised women, characters who really hadn’t held the screen before. In “Ultra City Smiths,” those “people” are played by figures resembling children’s dolls, which the computer has rendered as walking, talking politicians, police, reporters and denizens of a sordid underworld who populate the unhappy streets of a hopeless city. There’s something wrong with the whole thing. But perhaps the incongruity is the point.<br />The living dolls of “Ultra City Smiths”—the title will be explained toward the end of episode 2—include David Mills (voice of Jimmi Simpson), the rookie detective and new partner of leathery veteran Gail Johnson (Da’Vine Joy Randolph). Together, they are investigating the mysterious disappearance of mayoral candidate and rich guy Carpenter K. Smith (Kurtwood Smith). Described, quite often, as Ultra City’s “last bright hope,” Smith has his enemies, including Congressman Chris Pecker (Dax Shepard), who has taken inappropriate selfies—again—leaving his wife, the pant-suited Donella Pecker (Kristen Bell), to clean up his mess. The Anthony Weiner parallels are hard to miss.<br />Lady Andrea the Giant (Bebe Neuwirth) is the former women’s world wrestling champion and has to find a way to save her daughter, Little Grace (Alia Shawkat), from the gangsters with whom she’s fallen afoul. They include Rodrigo Smalls (Luis Guzmán), local crime lord and owner of the disco where Carpenter Smith’s son, Donovan (John C. Reilly), dances as the self-proclaimed King of the Night. Sister Mary Margaret (Melissa Villaseñor) is the foul-mouthed nun who runs the local flophouse. The good sister offers Street Hustler Boy (Damon Herriman) a bunk when things get tight.<br />If you’re thinking this series should have Tom Waits as its narrator, you’re right. And he is.<br />The six-part series will make its debut with two episodes (“Ultra City, She Don’t Care” and “King of the Night”); new installments will drop on subsequent Thursdays. It has a high-profile roster, including Debra Winger, providing the voices behind an animated cast that doesn’t bring much to the allegorical table. Dolls have starred in lots of shows and films, mostly of the horror variety. When Todd Haynes made “Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story” (1988) with Barbie dolls (or “Barbie-type dolls” as I remember the lawyers insisting), the limited flexibility of the figures being used reflected the emotional rigidity of the characters being portrayed. Conversely, the technique behind “Ultra City Smiths” is to manipulate the figures, which aren’t actually plastic anyway, to accommodate whatever posture the narrative requires. There’s simply too much motion among the allegedly inanimate objects. It’s ironic, perhaps, but if one ignores the principal gimmick of “Ultra City Smiths,” it might make for a more convincing and even noirish experience.</td>

He was also charged with obstruction of justice and four counts of making false statements during a June 2019 interview with federal law-enforcement agents. Prosecutors said they would seek his detention at a court proceeding in Los Angeles Tuesday afternoon.<br />Mr. Barrack was a powerful supporter of Mr. Trump’s, serving as an informal adviser on the Middle East to the 2016 campaign and eventually seeking unsuccessfully to become the special envoy to the Middle East, the indictment said. He went on to chair Mr. Trump’s 2017 inaugural committee, which was the subject of two federal investigations into its spending and into possible illegal foreign donations.<br />A spokesperson for Mr. Barrack said: “Mr. Barrack has made himself voluntarily available to investigators from the outset. He is not guilty and will be pleading not guilty.”</td>

Mr. Morris co-chaired a panel that made recommendations to Congress in 2016 that helped lead to the bill.<br />National Wildlife Federation President Collin O’Mara called the proposal “by far the most important piece of wildlife legislation in the past half century,” saying it provides a much-needed source of stable funding.</td>

      <td>Bimble, launched in June, lets locals easily share their favorite spots from coffee shops to tiny hotels—creating and swapping idiosyncratic travel guides with like-minded wanderers</td>
      <td>BIMBLE, A SMARTPHONE APP that launched in June, might sound like a dating site, but it’s more akin to Spotify. Holed up in Oxford, England, during the pandemic, Francesca Howland and Julia Mallaby Rossler—a couple of formerly globe-trotting corporate refugees—dreamt up the app for travelers to save, share and recommend favorite watering holes, tiny hotels, independent bookstores and the kinds of finds that can make a trip transporting.<br />The platform’s goal: to share insider knowledge with a community of people who want to experience places the way locals do—the app version of that friend you always ask for recommendations before touching down in Boston or Berlin. Without Bimble, you might not find the petting zoo hidden in the Amsterdam Forest or Lucky Chip, a cheerful burger joint in London’s Netil Market.<br />You can also use the app to create a “place list” for your next destination or as a guide to your own town to share with friends—or far-flung strangers. Users fill out little profiles listing the regions they know best as well as their interests (“ballroom dancing,” “eating amazing food”) so you can suss out like-minded wanderers whose taste in cocktails and caftans is right up your alley.<br />Still in its infancy, Bimble doesn’t reach every corner of the globe just yet. Coverage is spotty and random. (One user, based in England, cryptically titled her place list: “Nice pubs to try not necessarily near us.”) But the digital portal has attracted heavyweight investors like Dimitris Panagopoulos (an original backer of Net-a-Porter), and is, according to Ms. Howland, on track to have 300,000 users within the year.<br />Until then, think of Bimble as a leisurely, unpredictable stroll. Scroll through lists organized by themes (such as Food & Drink, Student Life and Well Being) and guides (Vegan Barcelona, Catskills Weekend Getaway). Then use the “thank you” button to let the poster know that their pick was spot on.</td>

      <td>Billion-dollar companies don’t have to be built in Silicon Valley.</td>
      <td>I enjoyed Steve Case’s op-ed “Innovation Moves to Middle America” (July 14). Entrepreneurship has always been an American tradition—not just a coastal one.<br />It’s true that big entrepreneurial wins have been concentrated in places that attracted the best software and computing talent (namely, Silicon Valley). Concentration of talent has real network effects. But there is talent everywhere and the rest of the country is catching up. Many of the top bio-IT companies are being built in places like Ann Arbor, Mich., and Raleigh and Durham, N.C.<br />Our venture-capital firm, 8VC, invests in Digital Diagnostics, which developed the first-ever FDA-approved computer-vision diagnostic algorithm—in which a computer fully replaces a physician. It was founded by a doctor and computer scientist out of America’s top ophthalmology program, the University of Iowa. Project44 and HDVI, two top logistics-technology companies, are based in Chicago, while another, Freightwaves, is in Chattanooga, Tenn.<br />We’ve relocated much of 8VC from Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas, where countless top companies are built today. It is also close to a lot of other destinations where we are doing business these days, including Oklahoma City, Dallas, Houston, Nashville and Wichita, Kan. It’s becoming well-known in the tech industry that governors of states where the bureaucratic and censorious far-left wing isn’t powerful are usually able to embrace innovation more quickly. New government technology to make regulation more dynamic will be built and applied at scale in the middle of the country first.<br />Many venture firms have spent lavishly looking for opportunities abroad, but there may be as many billion-dollar companies being built in so-called secondary or tertiary U.S. cities as there are in other countries.</td>

Some children are forced to travel hours each week to remain within state lines and receive treatments in specialized hospitals, even though similar treatments are available minutes away in a neighboring state.<br />Indiana’s legislature recently passed legislation permitting children to receive specialized care in Chicago, Cincinnati and Louisville, Ky.

This means U.S. manufacturers would gain an instant competitive advantage against less-efficient producers in China, India and Russia by adopting a border carbon adjustment backed by a domestic carbon fee. This is the only tool we have to hold other countries accountable for their emissions.<br />Why wouldn’t we adopt a climate policy that encourages investment and production at our facilities, which emit less? So long as we impose the same carbon price on domestic goods as we do on imports, a border adjustment is likely to pass muster at the WTO.<br />Similar policies are under consideration in Japan, Canada and the U.K., in addition to the EU. China can keep dragging its feet on climate, but doing so will cost it market share in a growing bloc of the largest economies.<br />Greg Bertelsen</td>

      <td>From honeymooners to basketball stars, guys are suiting up in quirkily printed cabana sets to inject some summer frivolity into their warm-weather wardrobes</td>
      <td>IN JUNE, Travis Wedgeworth, an audio engineer in Dallas, flew to Hawaii with his new bride for their honeymoon. Because it was a celebratory getaway, Mr. Wedgeworth, 32, wanted an outfit that was particularly “bright and eye-catching,” as he put it. He certainly found one: a high-wattage hula-girl-patterned cabana suit by the Toronto-based swimwear brand, Bather.<br />A cabana suit—also known as a “matching set” or “two-piece set”—is a combo comprising a shirt (normally a short-sleeved, camp-collared number) and shorts in the same, often startling pattern. Mr. Wedgeworth’s version caught plenty of eyes, causing strangers on the beach to stop him and say, “I love your outfit—where’d you get it?”<br />If his set’s many admirers wanted to procure their own cabana suits, they’d find plenty of options across the budgetary spectrum this summer. Fast-fashion labels like Shein and Boohooman offer polyester striped sets for as low as $25—a thrifty way to toe-dip into the trend. At the luxe end of the spectrum, Versace sells silk shorts and a sleeveless shirt in a coordinating starfish motif for $1,720 total, and Dior offers a matching shirt and shorts in a cartoony playing-card print, a collaboration with artist Kenny Scharf, for a combined price tag of $3,400.<br />For converts, cabana suits are the wearable embodiment of summertime frivolity. “The last year was so heavy, so to have fun patterns and colors that match just brings a lightness,” said Alan Richard Catarina, 34, a professional dancer and choreographer in Los Angeles who recently wore a jolly, pink floral-patterned set from Shein with subtle white sneakers while vacationing in Las Vegas.<br />Though they might look like novel Instagram fodder, cabana suits date back to the mid-20th century. Companies like bathing-suit pioneer Jantzen sold these easy-on, instant-outfit pairings as resort wear. If you flip through back copies of “Apparel Arts,” an influential men’s style magazine from that period, you’ll see advertisements featuring tanned men unwinding poolside in sets.</td>

      <td>A two-disc set from Resonance Records features previously unreleased live recordings that united trumpeter Roy Hargrove and pianist Mulgrew Miller.</td>
      <td>Twenty-four seconds into Cole Porter’s “What Is This Thing Called Love?” which opens the new two-disc release “In Harmony” (Resonance), trumpeter Roy Hargrove states the melody before setting off on unexpected but utterly logical improvised flights. We’re reminded of a sound—sweet, rounded, clear and bristling, supremely confident yet searching—that was Hargrove’s calling card when he arrived as a talked-about 20-year-old in New York, and which has been missing from that scene since his death in 2018, at 49, from cardiac arrest brought on by kidney disease.<br />As Hargrove digs into that opening song, pianist Mulgrew Miller swings a midtempo groove, having played an introduction that sounds like a question posed in harmonic terms (he answers, satisfyingly, minutes later, through a fleet-fingered solo). Miller’s casual grace, bold touch and resilient rhythm remind us of another lost piece of New York’s jazz puzzle; he died in 2013, at 57, following a stroke.<br />That neither musician is still with us, that both died in their prime, lends drama to these 13 tracks, which were recorded at concerts in 2006, at Manhattan’s Merkin Hall, and 2007, at Lafayette College’s Williams Center for the Arts in Easton, Pa. Yet any sense of absence is soon overshadowed by this duo’s enthralling presence. Sadness gives way to the rush of sensations—ease, joy, comfort, challenge, humor—that took hold whenever these two musicians played together.<br />When Hargrove died, the jazz world lost a beloved master who rose quickly to stardom at a moment of revived popular interest in jazz. He delivered on that early promise but defied the prevalent stylistic conservatism of that period, recording with equal skill and zeal alongside the Soulquarians, a loose confederation of musicians from the worlds of hip-hop and neo-soul (including Questlove, Erykah Badu and D’Angelo), as with jazz standard-bearers such as Herbie Hancock.<br />Miller, who was 14 years older than Hargrove, was also less well-known, his inclinations not as wide-ranging. However, the pianist—who played on 273 recording sessions, according to Tom Lord’s authoritative jazz discography—was an elemental presence as a bandleader and in-demand sideman who synthesized several strands of jazz pianism into a distinctive, soulful whole.</td>

      <td>The neo-Marxist movement rejects equal opportunity, merit and objectivity.</td>
      <td>In last week’s column about critical race theory, I said that I had barely scratched the surface of this complex movement. To dig deeper, I turned to a collection of essays by the movement’s founders and early adherents—“Critical Race Theory: The Key Writings That Formed the Movement”—published in 1996. Here is what I found in the volume and in an article by Kimberlé Crenshaw, one of the book’s editors and one of the movement’s most insightful thinkers.<br />• Critical race theory denies the possibility of objectivity. As the volume’s editors state in their illuminating introduction, “Scholarship about race in America can never be written from a distance of detachment or with an attitude of objectivity. . . . Scholarship—the formal production, identification, and organization of what will be called ‘knowledge’—is inevitably political.” And politics is about power—specifically, about the struggle between those who seek to maintain oppressive hierarchies and those who seek to overturn them. Scholarship can be a powerful weapon in that struggle.<br />• The theory moves race to the center of our focus. As the editors put it, it aims to “recover and revitalize the radical tradition of race-consciousness,” a tradition “that was discarded when integration, assimilation and the ideal of colorblindness became the official norms of racial enlightenment.”<br />• The founders of Critical Race Theory identified with Black Power movements much more than with those who were working for integration. This form of race-consciousness can’t be reduced to class-consciousness. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who understood the fight for equality as a class struggle, learned this lesson the hard way during his quest for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.<br />• Critical race theory is an explicitly left-wing movement inspired by the thinking of an Italian neo-Marxist, Antonio Gramsci. Against classic Marxism, for which material conditions are primary, Gramsci (1891-1937) focused on “hegemony”—the system of beliefs that “reinforces existing social arrangements and convinces the dominated classes that the existing order is inevitable,” as Ms. Crenshaw puts it.</td>

      <td>The building pace in the U.S. is the highest since the housing crash but it won’t be enough to fix a tight market for quite a while</td>
      <td>Home builders are building more. Which isn’t to say they are building enough.<br />On Tuesday the Commerce Department reported that construction was started on 1.643 million homes last month at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from May’s 1.546 million. Of those June housing starts, 1.16 million were for single-family homes—the most since March.<br />And that is after adjustments for seasonal swings that boost the figures for the colder months, when there is less actual construction, and depress the figures for the warmer months. Unadjusted (and not annualized), builders started 111,100 single-family homes last month, which marked the highest level since May 2007.<br />Even so, last month’s level of activity was still below the 108,400 single-family housing starts the U.S. experienced during an average June in the 1990s, when the country’s population was about a fifth lower than it is now. With demand for both new and previously owned homes running high, builders still aren’t keeping up. On Monday the National Association of Home Builders said that its measure of foot traffic from prospective buyers slipped this month but that it was higher than at any point in the 35 years prior to the pandemic, including during the housing bubble.<br />Struggling to meet demand is generally a good problem. For builders, though, the situation hasn’t been ideal. Shortages have pushed materials costs markedly higher, constraining their ability to build affordable homes. The NAHB calculates that changes in prices for softwood lumber added nearly $30,000 to the price of an average new single-family home between April 17, 2020, and July 8, 2021.</td>

      <td>Big auto lenders such as  Ally Financial  are enjoying some historic conditions. Things may not be quite this good in the future, but it is too soon to trade in the shares.<br />At a time when other lenders are struggling to sustain yield and loan growth, Ally on Tuesday reported records for quarterly revenue and for the number of completed consumer auto-loan applications. It also had the best credit performance by one key measure in its 102-year history, when it began as a lending arm of  General Motors Co. , with a net gain on charge-offs of 0.02 percentage point. This means that, with recovery values so high due to soaring car prices, it made money on charged-off loans.<br />Yields on auto leases in particular are tremendous right now since the vehicles are worth so much at the end of their terms. Auto leases generated a yield of 11.67% in the second quarter, up more than 3 percentage points from the first quarter and nearly triple their level from a year ago.<br />The dilemma now for investors is how to figure out how to normalize from here. Used-car price gains will surely start to slow at some point. For now, auto-lending stocks are getting somewhat cheap on a forward price/earnings basis as their earnings rise even as other stocks baking in better times ahead—spending-related plays like  Visa ,   Mastercard  or  American Express —are trading at relatively high multiples. A rapid return to normal might make the relatively expensive stocks look like bargains in retrospect and the cheap ones look pricier.<br />Still, auto lenders such as Ally might be better all-weather bets for now. For example, they would continue to benefit from tight supply, but also wouldn’t necessarily fall off too much if car lots do start to accumulate a bit more inventory when supply-chain crunches ease or used-car demand slows. That would boost loan growth to dealers and might even invite more buying by consumers. Spending-related stocks, meanwhile, won’t have as many defensive qualities if the economic recovery is tepid or is slowed by another wave of Covid-19 infections.</td>

That move was part of a broader effort to boost the country’s falling fertility rate.<br />In easing birth restrictions, the Communist Party said at the time that it would provide government support for education and child-rearing, recognizing the economic and societal strains that have discouraged married couples from having more children.<br />China introduced a strict “one-child policy” starting in 1980, a time when Beijing viewed the country’s fast-growing population as an obstacle to economic success. As the negative impact of birth controls grew increasingly clear over the decades, however, Beijing formally ended the one-child policy in 2016 by allowing all married couples to have as many as two babies.</td>

      <td>The ‘global minimum tax’ battle may set an example for those who consider low U.S. state levies ‘unfair.’</td>
      <td>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development declared earlier this month that it plans to adopt a global minimum corporate tax rate of at least 15%. It warmed my heart to see my ancestral homeland step up as one of the handful of nations to balk at this announcement.<br />Ireland wasn’t the largest country to protest the OECD’s move—Nigeria’s 200 million people dwarf its five million. Nor was it the only member of the European Union to do so—Hungary and Estonia did as well. But given Ireland’s outsize voice in international diplomacy, and its cultural ties to the U.S., it’s clear that conversations surrounding the global minimum tax rate will have a markedly celtic lilt to them. The Biden administration should pay close attention.<br />The premise behind the minimum global corporate tax is simple: Most governments around the world are looking to raise money. But they don’t like taxing the middle class, as this tends to result in lost elections, and there aren’t enough rich people to soak to raise the necessary funds. That means that governments have started to look to corporations as piggy banks they can raid. The Microsofts and Apples of the world don’t garner much public sympathy when it comes to paying their “fair share.”<br />In the not-so-distant past, the U.S. knew better. We knew that low corporate tax rates boosted investment, productivity, jobs and wages—all of which encouraged a prosperous economy. When the U.S. cut the corporate rate to 35% under Ronald Reagan—giving us the lowest rate in the world—we reaped huge benefits at the expense of other countries with higher rates. But those countries also learned from our example. They even started beating us at our own game, which led to an exodus of U.S. business to more-favorable tax climes, including Ireland. By the time we lowered rates under President Trump, that 35% U.S. corporate tax rate had become the third highest in the world.<br />The Biden administration wants to increase the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%. But it is worried that other countries will see the competitive advantage to be had in lowering their own rates. Other large economies are in the same boat.</td>

Any other time is a meeting-free zone.<br />By having certain hours, or days, when everyone is “on,” the idea goes, employees have more freedom and flexibility to do solo work the rest of the time.<br />The approach—practiced by some employers over the decades as an effort to keep working parents from being boxed out of early morning or late afternoon meetings—was adopted by some bosses during the pandemic as a way to keep remote collaboration from bleeding into all hours of the day. Now, as businesses reopen offices or implement longer-term work-from-home strategies, some companies say they are making core hours standard practice.<br />San Francisco-based  Dropbox ,  which is allowing workers to continue working remotely if they prefer, has set core collaboration hours for employees in the Americas between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. Pacific Time. Those hours partly overlap with core hours set for Dropbox workers in Europe and Asia.  Slack Technologies Inc.,  also in San Francisco, is pushing teams to limit meeting times to about four hours a day, letting groups decide which time windows work best for them.</td>

Ltd, a Chinese maker of smartphone touch screens and supplier to Apple and other companies, phased out Uyghur factory workers transferred from Xinjiang through a state-backed labor program last year, according to former staff and shop owners near one of its factories. The company has also ceased hiring Uyghur workers, according to current staff.<br />Chinese mask producer Hubei Haixin Protective Products Group Co. Ltd., whose personal protective equipment is sold on U.S. e-commerce sites, no longer employs laborers from Xinjiang, said a company employee who didn’t identify herself before hanging up. The company decided not to renew the contracts of its Xinjiang laborers last September after reports last year alleging the use of forced labor drew negative attention, the employee said.<br />And a Chinese subsidiary of  Taekwang Industrial Co.  Ltd., which makes sneakers for Nike in China, sent workers from the region home in the second quarter of last year, according to a Nike statement that was on the company’s website in June 2020. The company’s statement has been updated since then, but the old version of the statement has been stored by the Internet Archive, a nonprofit that keeps a digital library of webpages.<br />It couldn’t be determined if Xinjiang workers at Lens facilities were producing components that ended up in Apple products. An Apple spokesman said the company conducted more than 1,100 audits and interviewed 57,000 workers in the past year and a half  to check if suppliers were following its standards. The company’s supplier code of conduct prohibits any kind of discrimination.</td>

I appreciate that people in Japan are helping out by being thorough about this.”</td>

For U.S. audiences, it spent millions of dollars on a Super Bowl commercial featuring the Olympic rings. But in Japan, any link to the Games was too sensitive for the auto maker to advertise.<br />The Olympics open on Friday a year late and during a Covid-19 state of emergency in Tokyo. Anticipation and expectations for an economic windfall have largely evaporated. Stadiums and arenas that cost over $7 billion to build or renovate for the Games will be mostly empty after spectators were banned.<br />Japan wanted the Tokyo Olympics to show the country is still a global force despite its declining population and a maturing economy eclipsed by China. The Games would also show how Japan rebounded from a devastating tsunami in 2011. Instead, the Olympics has compounded a malaise over the pandemic that has put its leader under pressure to keep his job.<br />Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he was confident that extensive measures to keep the public away from the event would prevent the spread of infection and that the country will still benefit from a huge global television audience.</td>

A new poll by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper found that 55% of respondents don’t want the Games to begin Friday, an uptick from the spring, when doctors admonished organizers to cancel the event, and national disapproval hovered above 70%. In addition, 68% remained skeptical that Olympic protocols would be effective in preventing an uptick in cases in a country where vaccinations, while steadily rising, were slow to roll out.</td>

It follows an earlier TSA directive in May that required pipelines to notify federal authorities when they are targets or victims of cyberattacks.<br />“The lives and livelihoods of the American people depend on our collective ability to protect our nation’s critical infrastructure from evolving threats,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. “Through this security directive, DHS can better ensure the pipeline sector takes the steps necessary to safeguard their operations from rising cyber threats, and better protect our national and economic security.”<br />Biden administration officials didn’t make the text of the directive immediately available. In a statement, DHS said it would require owners and operators of TSA-designated critical pipelines to “implement specific mitigation measures to protect against ransomware attacks and other known threats” and to provide for recovery plans.<br />Critical infrastructure cybersecurity grew as an area of concern for Biden administration officials following the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in May.</td>

      <td>Oil and gas investors need to stop fretting about subsidies for green energy and start worrying about hanging on to the prodigious ones their own industry receives.<br />The world’s 20 largest economies spent $3.3 trillion in direct support for fossil fuels from 2015 to 2019, according to a new report by BloombergNEF. That is enough to build a solar electricity system 3½ times the size of the current U.S. grid. Most of it went to oil and gas. In addition to those ongoing amounts, the 10 largest countries’ Covid-19 stimulus plans also commit about $1.2 trillion to carbon intensive industries, more than three times the support for green ones.<br />Detailed data can be hard to come by, but a recent paper from Stockholm Environment Institute estimated that two key U.S. fossil-fuel tax breaks—expensing intangible drilling costs and percentage depletion provisions—added a median $4 a barrel of oil equivalent to the expected value of new oil and gas projects in the high-price years of 2008 and 2010 to 2014.<br />Purists may count only retail price support as a “real” subsidy, ignoring tax incentives, budget transfers, public finance support and investment by state-owned enterprises that those G-20 figures include. However, it is a distinction unlikely to hold up to sustained pressure, particularly with the focus of building back better and greener.<br />Some countries such as Russia and Saudi Arabia seem unlikely to commit to cutting their net greenhouse gas emissions to zero. But China, Brazil, the U.S. and the European Union have all pledged to do just that by around midcentury. Others are considering their options.</td>

Shell said at the time that it would likely appeal, a process that could take around one to two years to be heard, after which it can further appeal in the Dutch supreme court.<br />The case was brought by environmental groups who said the emissions-reduction target was in line with the United Nations guidance for member states aimed at preventing global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.<br />The Dutch court’s verdict punctuated the growing scrutiny that oil companies are facing over emissions from governments, investors and environmentalists.

As Sentral, the company is also rolling out technology allowing tenants to book any length of stay, whether one night or several years.<br />The company’s 10 apartment complexes offer furnished and unfurnished units for flexible lengths of stay.

In December, with the book already available for presale online, Reese Witherspoon’s media company Hello Sunshine said it was optioning the title for an Apple TV+ limited series starring Julia Roberts, who is also an executive producer. On May 4, the day the novel came out, Ms. Witherspoon unveiled it as her monthly book club pick. Sales soared.<br />“It’s a perfectly crafted rollout,” says Kristen McLean, executive director of business development at NPD BookScan. “All of the pieces were lined up.”<br />Television is deciding what books we read like never before. As streaming platforms battle for fresh content, they crave the complex characters and propulsive story lines that come ready-made in many novels. Successes such as HBO’s award-winning “Big Little Lies,” a star-packed series adapted from a Liane Moriarty novel, can buoy a streaming business. The volume of book-to-TV options has skyrocketed, along with the prices of those deals, so much so that by the time a reader discovers a new book, its future TV series could already be cast.</td>

It would exclude China, similar to the approach the administration has taken on issues such as export controls on advanced technology.

Some investors were betting that a combination of constrained supplies and booming demand would push oil above $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014.<br />Behind the burst of volatility is a realization that vaccines won’t prevent episodic flare-ups in infection and the introduction of measures to control new variants, according to Marwan Younes, chief investment officer at Massar Capital Management, a commodities-focused hedge fund.<br />“It’s going to be a lot more turbulent than people expected,” he said.</td>

      <td>L Brands will soon spin off Victoria’s Secret. A clean slate might look good, but it is no guarantee that the brand’s valuation will suddenly fly.</td>
      <td>After more than three decades together, Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works— L Brands ’ two remaining brands—are about to split ways. Bath & Body Works feels that its association with the lingerie brand is bringing its valuation down while Victoria’s Secret feels its turnaround thunder is being stolen. Will they be better off on their own?<br />On Aug. 3, Victoria’s Secret will be listed as a separate company while L Brands will change its name to Bath & Body Works. It is symbolically a significant milestone for L Brands whose former brands— Abercrombie & Fitch ,  Express, New York & Co.—once ruled the mall. Once the spinoff is complete, L Brands will only be left with the seller of lotions and fragrances. After the two brands gave their investor pitches Monday, L Brands shares fell 3.8%, though it accompanied a broader retail selloff as markets weighed the risks of the Delta variant of Covid-19.<br />The separation is, to a large extent, about the perception of a fresh start. The two brands have had separate management teams long before the intention to split them. “Right now the combination of the two entities is discounting the true worth of Bath & Body Works, which is one of the best businesses in retail, and it’s hiding the true opportunity at Victoria’s Secret,” notes Simeon Siegel, analyst at BMO Capital Markets. Even after gaining 77% year to date, L Brands trades at roughly 12 times forward-12-month earnings. Peers such as  VF Corp.  and Gap fetch 25 times and 15 times, respectively.<br />Speaking on an investor presentation Monday afternoon, Victoria’s Secret’s Chief Executive Martin Waters said the brand has pivoted from “being about what he wants to being about what she wants.” That turnaround seems to be working: In its fiscal first quarter, Victoria’s Secret pulled in higher sales than it did in the same period in pre-pandemic 2019—a remarkable feat given its steady decline leading up to the pandemic. Margins have also improved vastly thanks to better inventory management.<br />It is no secret, though, that Bath & Body Works has been the star at L Brands for some time. Its top line has grown at 12.4% a year on average in the last five years while revenue at Victoria’s Secret shrank. Yet the two brands’ diverging performance over the years also highlights how diversification can be useful in a sector as susceptible to fickle trends as retail. Look no further than Gap, which called off its Old Navy spinoff in January 2020 after the star brand’s sales suddenly started stalling in 2019.</td>

The new hub could exceed half a million square feet and would complement Apple’s current arrangement, where the company leases soundstages to film in the Los Angeles area and other parts of the world.<br />Since launching in November 2019, Apple TV+ has streamed a handful of well-known shows and movies, including hits “Ted Lasso” and “The Morning Show,” but it remains a relatively small operation compared with entrenched rivals like  Netflix Inc.  or  Amazon.com Inc.  Now, with an expansion under way, the company is using big-budget movies and a spate of new film and TV deals to set the stage for it to compete more directly with other tech players.<br />A larger Apple footprint in the entertainment capital would reinforce the commitment of the world’s most valuable company in the streaming wars that are defining modern-day Hollywood. Apple TV+ has occupied a curious position in the industry, known for well-regarded shows but lacking the scale many producers assumed it would have, especially given its aggressive push into music and podcasts.<br />In recent months, investors have come to believe that even a Goliath like Apple will need to double down on entertainment if it wants to compete for subscribers, as consolidations like the WarnerMedia- Discovery Inc.  tie-up turn the market into a top-heavy brawl. Apple executives appear to agree, announcing in the past year a new Leonardo DiCaprio movie, record-setting acquisitions and a series of other initiatives that signal a new chapter for its Hollywood efforts.</td>

S&P 500 futures rose 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.4%, pointing to gains for both the broad-market index and technology stocks.<br />Investors have grown concerned over the Delta coronavirus variant, prompting a reassessment of the economy’s prospects.

The planned flight would be Blue Origin’s inaugural crewed mission and a milestone toward Mr. Bezos’ goal of developing a viable space business.<br />Mr. Bezos has been building toward the launch since 2000, when he founded Blue Origin. The company has hired staffers to develop rockets, engines and spacecraft and now employs more than 3,500 people at facilities in Florida, California and other locations.<br />In the run-up to today’s launch, Mr. Bezos has been promoting Blue Origin’s launch using his personal Instagram account. One video showed him fist-bumping his brother in a blue flight suit; in a photo he posed with his fellow New Shepard passengers in the Texas desert.<br />The flight is timed to coincide with the date in 1969 when the Apollo 11 mission landed on the moon. In speeches, Mr. Bezos has cited that event as a key moment during his life and stated his conviction that humanity must establish outposts in the solar system where people could live.</td>

A company spokesperson said it hasn’t decided on any course of action with respect to the talc lawsuits, except to defend the safety of talc and to litigate pending claims.<br />Here is how a chapter 11 filing could affect the legal fight between the healthcare giant and the thousands of people who blame one of its flagship products for their cancer.<br />Bankruptcy gives companies several tools to resolve all of the liability claims they face now or in the future over products that cause injuries or are defective in some way. After a bankruptcy filing, lawsuits in every state and federal court are automatically paused and brought before a single bankruptcy judge.<br />Consumers have alleged in thousands of lawsuits against J&J that talcum powder in Johnson’s Baby Powder and Johnson’s Shower to Shower can cause inflammation that leads to cancer. Other complaints allege the talc products were contaminated with asbestos. J&J has denied the allegations and has for years been defending itself against talc-related litigation.<br />A bankruptcy filing by a J&J subsidiary would halt pending lawsuits, at least for a while. The publicly traded parent company could receive the benefit of the automatic stay even if only an affiliate filed for bankruptcy.</td>

From 1999 to 2019, the nation lost nearly half a million people to overdoses of prescription and illegal opioids, according to federal data.<br />Under the contours of the deal, states and municipalities still have several months to sign on, and the amount ultimately paid will depend on how many participate, the people familiar with the talks said. The companies can also still walk away if they aren’t satisfied with the number of states and governments that join, the people said.<br />New York, meanwhile, has struck a more than $1 billion deal with AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal and McKesson midway through a trial against those companies and four other pharmaceutical firms, some of the people said. That deal, which is expected to be announced Tuesday, would remove the three distributors from the trial and represents New York’s portion of the broader settlement.<br />Johnson & Johnson already settled with New York for $263 million ahead of the trial.</td>

He will take office on July 28 after winning 50.1% of the votes in the June 6 election versus 49.9% for Ms. Fujimori, who has refused to accept the results.<br />The election of the 51-year-old head of a Marxist party could result in an overhaul of Peru’s market economy, which has relied on global trade to power one of Latin America’s fastest-growing economies the past two decades.<br />The rise of Mr. Castillo, a former schoolteacher from the rural Andes, underscores how the pandemic can fuel a backlash against the ruling class in hard-hit countries. His election occurred amid a backdrop of public anger over the state’s failure to deliver decent public services despite years of strong economic activity and a slew of corruption scandals that tarnished several powerful politicians.<br />The pandemic in Peru has killed more people on a per capita basis than anywhere else in the world and exposed a crumbling public health system.

Jim Banks (R., Ind.), chair of the Republican Study Committee, a group of the most conservative House Republicans, to serve as the select committee’s top-ranking GOP member.<br />His other appointees are moderate Rep.

      <td>Senators are hoping to strike deal on how to pay for the legislation, which includes $600 billion in new spending</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Lawmakers sparred Monday over Senate Democrats’ decision to impose a midweek deadline on a bipartisan group still scrambling to reach an agreement on a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said last week he planned to set up a vote Wednesday opening debate on the infrastructure bill. But the bipartisan group of 22 senators hasn’t yet struck a deal on how to fully pay for the cost of the legislation, which would spend roughly $600 billion above projected federal spending on improvements to roads, bridges and broadband access, among others.<br />Over the weekend, the group agreed to remove a source of revenue disliked by Republicans that would strengthen the Internal Revenue Service’s collection of unpaid taxes. That left lawmakers racing to find another way to offset the bill’s cost and complete its text.<br />“There was a little movement in the wrong direction when it came to pay-fors,” Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas), a member of Senate GOP leadership, told reporters Monday. “There’s a bipartisan desire for us to do a real infrastructure bill that’s responsibly paid for,” he said. “The problem is they haven’t been able to do it on Sen. Schumer’s timeline.”<br />Lawmakers said Monday they weren’t sure what would happen if there wasn’t enough support Wednesday to begin debate on the infrastructure bill. Republicans have said they wouldn’t vote to start debate Wednesday unless an agreement largely has been fleshed out.</td>

      <td>The Delta variant spooks markets, but the vaccines work even if the virus won’t go away.</td>
      <td>Will the pandemic ever end? That’s what investors asked Monday as they sold off stocks and rushed into bonds on fears that Covid-19’s Delta variant will slow the economic recovery or lead to more lockdowns. Let’s hope the political class has learned some lessons from the last 18 months—namely, that Covid will always be with us, and that we have to live with it without shutting down the economy.<br />New Covid uncertainty and political angst explains the 2.1% drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Value stocks tied to the reopening such as airlines, hospitality and energy companies took the biggest hits. Companies that have benefited from lockdowns were less affected.  Etsy ,  which has made a niche market selling hand-made masks, rose 3.2%.<br />The Delta variant is estimated to be more than twice as transmissible as the original Covid strain that emerged from Wuhan. Australia reports that several people were infected after “fleeting” contacts in a shopping mall. U.S. Covid cases have tripled in a month, as states lifted restrictions and travel rebounded. In the U.K., which has among the highest vaccination rates in the world, cases are approaching their winter peak.<br />Previously infected individuals appear to be more susceptible to re-infection by the Delta variant, which could explain some of the rising cases. The  Pfizer  vaccine is also estimated to be 10% to 30% less effective at preventing symptomatic illness, which means more infections among the vaccinated. Chinese vaccines appear to be less effective, and many developing countries that took the Chinese shots are administering booster shots by Western manufacturers.<br />But none of this is cause for Covid panic or more lockdowns. Vaccines are still highly effective at preventing severe illness, which is why hospitalizations in the U.K. have increased much less than cases. Some 99% of hospitalized Americans now are among the unvaccinated. Most vaccinated people with new infections—such as the five Texas Democratic state lawmakers who fled to Washington, D.C., last week—experience cold-like symptoms.</td>

      <td>The once-secret report, now public, is a warning for a derelict Congress.</td>
      <td>The Trump Administration never released its much-mooted 116-page argument for “national security” tariffs on  Volkswagen s and other foreign cars, and now we know why. Credit to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo for finally publishing it this month and letting the public see the shoddy handiwork.<br />President Trump ultimately didn’t impose the suggested tariffs of up to 35% on foreign autos, but the report is a warning of how much trade power Congress has ceded. A law known as Section 232 lets the President “adjust” imports if they threaten to impair “national security.” The autos report defines that expansively to include not only “national defense,” but also “the general security and welfare of certain industries” that are believed “critical.”<br />Hence the absurdity. The autos report cites data from 2017, and that year the world’s biggest car maker was  General Motors ,  which produced 8.9 million vehicles, including two million made in the U.S. The fourth-largest was  Ford ,  which made 6.1 million automobiles, 2.4 million in the U.S.<br />The report also claims that under Section 232 it doesn’t matter whether the purportedly perilous imports come from staunch American allies—which they do. The No. 2 and 3 auto manufacturers in 2017 were Toyota and Volkswagen. In Toyota’s case, its facilities inside the U.S. that year made a million automobiles. So did  Honda  and the company then called Fiat Chrysler. Yet the report treats Chrysler as foreign, as if it would represent a fifth column during America’s coming war with Italy.<br />The analysis of Mexico suffers the opposite problem. “Imports,” the report frets, “now exceed American-owned production in the United States.” This narrow framing excludes GM’s and Ford’s capacities across the border. Auto makers have sought efficiency by integrating North American supply chains, and the report admits that “80 percent of Mexican vehicle production is exported to the United States.”</td>

      <td>Democrats attack tech firms to deflect from Covid setbacks.</td>
      <td>When a bully gets what it wants, it comes back for more.  Facebook  has spent the last year acquiescing to increasingly aggressive liberal demands to suppress content. So it’s no surprise that Democrats have decided they can also get away with making CEO Mark Zuckerberg a scapegoat for plateauing rates of vaccination in the U.S.<br />Last week the White House launched a pointed offensive against Big Tech firms for allegedly not controlling enough vaccine-related speech by users. Press Secretary Jen Psaki criticized the companies from her daily podium, and the Surgeon General pressed them in a report. President Biden declared over the weekend that Facebook is “killing people,” though he walked back that “killing” point on Monday.<br />Sen. Amy Klobuchar snarled that social-media firms should “take this crap off of their platforms that are basically telling people, ‘oh, hey, there’s problems [with the vaccine]’ when we know science proves there isn’t.” The messages are clearly coordinated.<br />Vaccine hesitancy is slowing America’s recovery from the pandemic. Yet Facebook released a rare rebuttal to its progressive tormentors, noting that “vaccine acceptance on the part of Facebook users in the US has increased by 10-15 percentage points” to 85%. It also says the U.K. and Canada “have similar rates of Facebook usage to the US,” yet “those countries have achieved more than 70% vaccination of eligible populations,” Mr. Biden’s July 4 goal.<br />Democrats are paying for having promoted vaccine skepticism in the presidential campaign last year. Then-candidate Biden warned that a rapid approval timeline could be politicized, a point echoed by some who resist the vaccine today, and Vice President Kamala Harris publicly doubted a Trump-approved vaccine. It’s no surprise that this skepticism is now playing out among some Americans when the same politicians say vaccines are safe when they’re in power.</td>

      <td>He says more spending lowers prices by . . . well, you figure it out.</td>
      <td>The White House rolled out President Biden on Monday to take a victory lap on Covid and the economy six months into his tenure. This wasn’t the best timing given that asset prices took a header on fears about Covid’s Delta variant (see nearby). But stocks fluctuate, and more notable for the coming months was Mr. Biden’s discourse on inflation.<br />Someone in the White House must think inflation is a growing political problem because Mr. Biden spent most of his time on the subject explaining why it’s no problem at all. “Our experts believe and the data shows that most of the price increases we’ve seen are—were expected and expected to be temporary,” Mr. Biden said.<br />Price increases were expected by whom? By contributors to these pages, sure. But not by the White House budget office, which forecast inflation of 2.1% in 2021 and 2022 in its recent budget proposal. Not by the Federal Reserve, which has underestimated inflation at each of its meetings this year. At its June monetary policy meeting the median forecast among Fed officials for 2021 was 3%. In March their forecast was 2.2%. In June the actual consumer-price increase over a year ago was 5.4%.<br />Then there was Mr. Biden’s novel analysis that his $4 trillion spending plan will keep inflation in check. “If we increase the availability of quality, affordable child care, elder care, paid leave, more people will enter the workforce,” Mr. Biden said. “These steps will enhance our productivity—raising wages without raising prices. That won’t increase inflation. It will take the pressure off of inflation, give a boost to our workforce, which leads to lower prices in the years ahead.”<br />So Mr. Biden thinks that cradle-to-grave government subsidies with no obligation to work will somehow cause more people to work. That sure hasn’t worked with his enhanced federal unemployment benefits.</td>

But as commanders in chief, the two would draw very different conclusions from Vietnam. These differences were most recently underscored by Mr. Biden’s decision to conclude the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan and bring the troops home.<br />Mr. Bush, who has mostly steered clear of politics since leaving office, publicly called Mr. Biden’s move “a mistake.” Though he didn’t invoke Vietnam, he did wonder aloud about the consequences for Afghan women and the friends America would be leaving behind. “They’re just going to be left behind to be slaughtered by these very brutal people, and it breaks my heart.”<br />President Biden betrays no such qualms.<br />“The Taliban is not the North Vietnamese Army,” he says. “There’s going to be no circumstance where you’ll see people being lifted off the roof of an Embassy of the United States from Afghanistan.”<br />Mr. Biden’s words about embassy rooftops bring back memories of a similar reference from Mr. Bush back when I served as his chief speechwriter, a time (pre-surge) when many had written Iraq off as hopeless and wanted our troops out at almost any cost. But where Mr. Biden meant these words as reassurance, Mr. Bush expressed them as resolve. “Billy,” he told me, “we are not going to abandon the people of Iraq the way we abandoned the people of Vietnam, from the rooftop of an embassy.”</td>

      <td>A 5,000-word essay by the strongman explains his thinking. It pays to listen.</td>
      <td>Writing long, historically focused opinion pieces is an activity more characteristic of think tankers than heads of state, but Russian President Vladimir Putin is anything but conventional. Last week he published a 5,000-plus-word article that reviews the last millennium to conclude that Russians, Belarusians and Ukrainians share a common history, faith and destiny.<br />In Mr. Putin’s view, Western powers have tried for centuries to separate them, but those efforts are doomed to fail. He argues that “the anti-Russia project has been rejected by millions of Ukrainians” in Crimea, the Donbas and elsewhere. The Russian president believes that after centuries of common development and trade, the Ukrainian economy simply cannot flourish without close integration with Russia. Without his country, Ukraine will flounder, despite the occasional aid it receives from its Western paymasters, Mr. Putin writes. Even before the pandemic, Ukraine’s gross domestic product per capita was below $4,000. “This is less than in the Republic of Albania, the Republic of Moldova, or unrecognized Kosovo.” (Moscow doesn’t recognize Kosovo’s independence from Serbia.) “Nowadays,” Mr. Putin writes, “Ukraine is Europe’s poorest country.”<br />Some observers dismissed the essay as an empty propaganda ploy aimed at distracting Russian public opinion in the face of a surging pandemic. Others saw it as an announcement that Russia will escalate its support for the pro-Moscow forces in the smoldering conflict in eastern Ukraine. Since deception and surprise are fundamental tools of Mr. Putin’s statecraft, anything is possible, but Western powers would be well advised to take the essay seriously. The Russian president’s policies will always and inevitably reflect his calculations about the opportunities and risks he faces at any given moment, but his strategic objectives are unmistakable. Mr. Putin’s quest to rebuild Russian power requires the reassertion of Moscow’s hegemony over Belarus and Ukraine.<br />In Belarus, where the Kremlin enabled the embattled government to survive months of pro-democracy protests and Western sanctions, Mr. Putin has crushed any hopes President Lukashenko had of escaping Moscow’s embrace. Ukraine is a tougher nut to crack. But the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is moving inexorably toward completion, weakening Ukraine’s influence over European policy making. Infighting and disorganization also continue to prevent the European Union from becoming a significant geopolitical actor. Amid all this, Mr. Putin has served notice that he will patiently but relentlessly pursue his strategic goals at Kyiv’s expense.<br />The best way to think of Russia these days is as being constrained but not contained. That is, the West has failed abysmally to develop a coherent policy to stop the Kremlin’s attacks on its neighbors or its opposition to the EU and the American-based world order. Sanctions don’t deter Mr. Putin; the West is hopelessly disunited on Russia policy, and the resulting incoherent policies offer Moscow opportunities from the Middle East to Myanmar to advance its foreign-policy agenda and bolster its commercial interests. Under these circumstances Russia will continue to test the West, and Mr. Putin will look to victories abroad to bolster his standing at home.</td>

      <td>An ‘emergency psychiatrist’ ﬁnds that only his patients’ words, not the language of science and medicine, can truly describe their suffering.</td>
      <td>For patients in the throes of serious mental illness—and for their families—life can be hard, at times agonizing. Clinical care givers, repeatedly called on to provide insight and offer compassion, face their own wrenching difficulties. And yet the challenge of caring for the mentally ill can also be a call to action. So it was for Karl Deisseroth, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Stanford University whose memoir, “Projections” (Random House, 231 pages, $28), describes his experience as a clinician and researcher, offering up case studies from his practice and exploring the biological underpinnings of his patients’ conditions.<br />Dr. Deisseroth tells us that he entered medical school planning to become a neurosurgeon but found himself unexpectedly captivated by his student psychiatry rotation, drawn both to the human drama and to the scientific imperative to understand the mechanistic basis of psychological dysfunction. For many patients, he soon realized, “nobody could give answers to the simplest questions” about what their disease “really was, in a physical sense, or why this person was the one suffering, or how such a strange and terrible state had come to be part of the human experience.”<br />On his worst days, he says, he wanted to leave medicine entirely, unable to bear the extremes of suffering he was encountering. “It is not just the magnitude of the pain but also its incessance—the unrelenting descent into the abyss, day after day, year after year.” Yet on balance he found engaging with patients both intriguing and essential. In contrast to ailments like a fractured leg or a badly pumping heart, he notes, psychiatric problems can’t be directly monitored. It’s the brain’s “hidden communication process, its internal voice, that struggles,” he writes. There is nothing to measure except words, “the patient’s communications, and our own.”<br />At times, the words can be revealing. Winnie, an intellectual property lawyer, tells her doctors that she had started worrying about the “information vampires” around her and has taken to lining her room with metal to prevent a neighbor from accessing her thoughts. Her condition suggests the onset of schizophrenia. Then there’s Mr. N., a dour older patient who can barely muster any words at all and evinces a lack of interest in his own granddaughter. These symptoms may point to the “anhedonia of depression,”the inability to find reward or motivation in life’s natural joys. Patients with a slippery condition called borderline personality disorder, we learn, are often emotionally manipulative and “engage, entwine, and draw in others, as least for a time.” Meanwhile, patients with autism, Dr. Deisseroth explains, struggle with the “rate of information flow,” a difficulty that complicates the many social interactions that are rich in data and require rapid processing.<br />Dr. Deisseroth is best known in scientific circles as a pioneer of optogenetics, a technique that allows researchers studying so-called model organisms (like fish or mice) to examine how particular neurons contribute to complex behaviors. First, through genetic engineering, specific brain cells are made responsive to light. Then scientists activate the cells using fiber-optic lasers threaded into the recesses of a living brain. Applying this approach in mice, for instance, researchers have shown that distinct groups of neurons are responsible for different components of anxiety, like rapid breathing and risk avoidance. For the author, these studies suggest a way to think about the precise “separability of one element of an inner state.”</td>

      <td>They start with important truths—slavery was wicked—and get carried away into monomania.</td>
      <td>The political philosopher Isaiah Berlin turned an obscure fragment by the ancient Greek poet Archilochus (“The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing”) into an intellectual’s cocktail-party game. In a famous essay, published as a book in 1953, Berlin suggested that the world is divided between hedgehogs and foxes—between those who believe in One Big Thing (one all-sufficient super-explanation), and those who are content with a more modest, irrational and even incoherent idea of history’s unfolding. Karl Marx was a supreme hedgehog: Everything, for him, was about the conflict of economic classes. Franklin D. Roosevelt was a restlessly improvising fox.<br />The world’s hedgehog population tends to expand in times of stress and change. Lately it has exploded in the U.S. Hedgehogs are thick on the ground, all of them advancing One Big Thing or another—each peering through the lens of a particular obsession. At the moment, the biggest One Big Thing is race—the key, it seems, to all of America, to the innermost meanings of the country and its history.<br />It isn’t really true. Race is one of many big things in America. It is hardly the most important. Americans need to desanctify the subject of race—to mute its claims, which have grown absolutist and, as it were, theological in their thoroughness, their dogmatism.<br />Critical race theory has spread across the U.S. like—forgive the expression—a virus, coming to infect primary schools and high schools and universities, foundations, art museums, big corporations, the military, local, state and federal government bureaucracies. It’s everywhere in the West Wing. President Biden, who spent almost 40 years following the ways of an amiable political fox in the Senate—exchanging pleasantries and now and then doing legislative business with Confederate mossbacks like Strom Thurmond and James Eastland—has, in his old age, signed on with the monomaniacs of the left.<br />The hedgehog’s trajectory may begin on the side of undeniable and important truth—for example, the truth that slavery was a great wickedness in America (as it was elsewhere in the world), and that race prejudice has been a chronic American dilemma and a moral blight that has damaged and scarred the lives of millions of black American citizens over generations.</td>

      <td>Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations across the U.S. are growing steadily higher as the infectious Delta variant takes hold and the pace of vaccination subsides from highs reached in April.<br />The country has reported an average of 32,287 new coronavirus cases each day over the past week, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Johns Hopkins data, more than double what the seven-day average was 10 days ago. The uptick in cases has touched every state and Washington, D.C., with the seven-day average of newly reported cases exceeding the 14-day average in each place for the past four days, according to the data.<br />Coronavirus-related hospitalizations have also jumped, rising 35.8% between July 7 and July 13 compared with the previous seven days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />Doctors and epidemiologists point to the Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2, as a main cause. The variant, now dominant in the U.S., is estimated to be 40%-80% more infectious than the Alpha variant. First detected in India late last year, Delta played a significant role in a record-setting surge of infections there and has since led to increases in cases around the world. Existing Covid-19 vaccines are effective against the variant, though no vaccine is 100% effective.<br />While the latest U.S. Covid-19 metrics are still far lower than peaks reached early this year, they have raised concern among public-health officials, epidemiologists and investors. U.S. stocks, oil prices and bond yields all fell Monday as anxiety mounted over the spread of the Delta variant and its potential impact on the global economy—similar to trading patterns seen in the earliest days of pandemic.</td>

      <td>Officials said Canada could further ease restrictions to allow fully vaccinated tourists from other countries beginning in September</td>
      <td>OTTAWA—Canada said it would allow fully vaccinated Americans to enter the country for recreational or tourist activities beginning Aug. 9, more than a year after authorities first closed the 5,500-mile border to most travelers to limit the spread of Covid-19.<br />The government said Monday that border restrictions for fully vaccinated travelers from other countries could also be lifted beginning Sept. 7, assuming Canada’s Covid-19 caseload stays relatively low.<br />“We are very pleased to gradually and responsibly open up,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. He said the decision to allow fully vaccinated Americans to visit Canada before tourists from other countries “is in recognition of our unique bond, especially between border communities.”<br />American citizens and permanent residents will need to provide proof of their full vaccination status, with their last dose taking place at least two weeks before their arrival, and must not have any Covid-19 symptoms, officials said. They will also be required to present evidence of an approved negative Covid-19 test taken within 72 hours of their arrival in Canada. Officials said that starting Aug. 9, they won’t require follow-up tests from people who are fully vaccinated unless they are selected for random testing.<br />The U.S. Department of Homeland Security declined to say Monday whether it planned to renew or modify its own border restrictions with Canada. The two countries will need to decide by Wednesday whether to renew their shared border restrictions for another month, as they have done since March 2020, or modify them. Canada’s public-safety minister, Bill Blair, said Monday that he was told the U.S. expects to renew its current restrictions.</td>

      <td>In Opera Parallèle’s remount of Joby Talbot and Gene Scheer’s fact-based opera, the story of a perilous mountain expedition is presented using sophisticated animation.</td>
      <td>“Everest,” an opera by Joby Talbot and Gene Scheer, made a powerful impression at its Dallas Opera world premiere in 2015. A taut, absorbing depiction of a real, ill-fated expedition to the summit of Mount Everest in 1996, the piece zeroes in on three climbers—Rob Hall (the expedition’s leader), Doug Hansen and Beck Weathers—and Jan Arnold, Hall’s pregnant wife back home. It explores their connections but mostly their profound isolation in the face of the raging blizzard that will cost Rob and Doug their lives.<br />Opera Parallèle, the home company of conductor Nicole Paiement, who led the premiere, has remounted the piece as a digital graphic novel, which is now available on demand from the Dallas Opera’s new streaming channel (rental $19.99; no subscription required; available through Jan. 16, 2022). This ingenious production focuses the action even further on that isolation, as well as on the hubris that prompts humans to challenge the unforgiving natural world, and the porous border between life and death.<br />Directed by Brian Staufenbiel, with the work of illustrator Mark Simmons and director of photography David Murakami, the film is laid out to look like a book, with multiple panes per page, floating in a black, starry background of seemingly infinite space. Black, white and shades of blue dominate the visual palette, depicting the mountain and a blank-eyed chorus of the dead—representing the hundreds of climbers killed over decades of attempts at the summit—that surrounds the living characters. Only the living humans are drawn in warm colors. They are animated in a lifelike manner, their faces made mobile with technology that reproduced the expressions of the singers as they recorded their parts in a studio. That color and movement embodies the living characters’ hope of survival but also their frailty, since the chilly, block-like backgrounds; the stiff, looming chorus; and the steady, inexorable pacing of the rest of the animation all point to a bad outcome.<br />This visual environment and tempo complemented the music, which balances the hopeful solo voices against the storm that rages in the orchestra and the eerie, echoing constancy of the chorus that counts out the time—“2:59. 3:12. 3:21”—with every minute making a safe descent less likely. The vocal characterizations are distinctive: Nathan Granner’s poignant tenor expresses Rob’s adventurous spirit, his sense of responsibility for his clients—rather than leaving the ailing Doug behind, he drags him along and finally dies beside him—and his love for Jan. Baritone Hadleigh Adams ably conveys Doug’s fundamental weakness; mezzo Sasha Cooke makes Jan, patched through to Rob as he dies on the mountain, a heartbreakingly stalwart companion. Bass Kevin Burdette embodies Beck’s life force as he hallucinates a backyard barbecue and his daughter, Meg (Charlotte Fanvu); her appearance draws him back from death and prompts him to save himself.<br />The chorus part was performed by a quartet of singers, their voices skillfully expanded into a larger ensemble through multitrack recording. The big orchestra called for in the score was represented by a digital soundtrack created by engineer Magnus Green in collaboration with Ms. Paiement, who also conducted the singers. It was efficient, and supplied the necessary momentum and background, but the richness and variety of the acoustic instrumental sound was missing, flattened into a more generalized, electronic timbral effect. Drawing and animation successfully rendered the story of “Everest” through a new lens; however, compressing its orchestral music into one dimension, while appropriate for the medium and certainly cost-effective, felt like a loss.</td>

      <td>Behind the rout, investors say, is a growing list of concerns about the recovery</td>
      <td>Stocks, bond yields and oil prices declined Monday in the most acute sign yet that investors are second-guessing the strength of the global economic recovery that sent markets soaring this year.<br />Markets rallied in the first half of 2021, thanks to investors’ bets that economies would bounce back, as countries rolled out Covid-19 vaccinations and lifted restrictions on businesses. Reports on everything from retail sales and housing prices to employment have shown swaths of the U.S. economy healing, helping send the S&P 500 to 39 record closes this year and almost double from its March 2020 trough.<br />Monday’s pullback put a dent in that narrative. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 725.81 points, or 2.1%, to 33962.04, logging its steepest decline since October. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which falls as bond prices rise, sank to its lowest level since February. And U.S. crude oil prices slid 7.5%—marking their worst session since September.<br />Behind the rout, investors say, is a growing list of concerns about the recovery. The Delta coronavirus variant has spread rapidly, reigniting the debate in several countries about whether governments should resume lockdowns and curb activity. Meanwhile, inflation has accelerated faster than many anticipated, and strained U.S.-China relations have put pressure on trillions of dollars’ worth of U.S.-listed Chinese companies.<br />Many money managers believe the global economy will be able to keep growing. They just don’t know how quickly—and whether the gains will be enough to keep increasingly pricey-looking markets rising after a banner first half.</td>

      <td>The electronic duo’s highly anticipated album builds off the aesthetic of their first, culminating in a suite of songs that are as atmospheric as they are grounded in real time.</td>
      <td>Electronic music duo Darkside sounds very of-this-moment, but its roots can be traced back for at least a half-century. The band comprises 31-year-old Nicolás Jaar primarily on vocals and electronics and 35-year-old guitarist Dave Harrington, and each plays multiple instruments. Together, they make psychedelic dance music with long, gradual builds that are alternately unsettling and ecstatic.<br />The allure of this project is how artfully Darkside combines the passions of each member. Mr. Jaar made an immediate impact in 2011 with his solo album “Space Is Only Noise,” with songs featuring his eerie and odd voice built on the foundation of pulsing minimal techno. He has since released several solo albums and soundtracks and has staged art installations, while also collaborating with higher-profile artists as on the 2019 LP “Magdalene” by English art-pop singer FKA Twigs. Mr. Harrington’s roots are in jazz and improvisational rock, and his work under his own name touches on the Grateful Dead, early 1970s space-rock, and the jazz fusion of Miles Davis. The first Darkside full-length, 2013’s “Psychic,” found them meeting in the middle, with Mr. Jaar’s stretched out dance grooves serving as a rhythmic bed for Mr. Harrington’s spare funk riffing and cosmic exploratory leads.<br />The record was a critical hit, and the pair were an instant must-see at festivals. Their ability to stitch their songs together into long tracks with staggering climaxes brought to mind the concert prowess of Daft Punk, a connection reinforced when Darkside created an album-length remix of the French duo’s 2013 LP “Random Access Memories.” But just as Darkside seemed poised for a commercial breakthrough, Messrs. Jaar and Harrington set it aside and moved on to other work. It was almost as if they preferred to stay underground, and it was unclear if they would record as Darkside again. But after eight years and a lot of work by the two men in other realms, the project returns with “Spirals” (Matador), out Friday.<br />The LP opens with “Narrow Road” and a chiming prepared guitar, followed by the moan of Mr. Jaar’s voice. The fact that a stringed instrument is the first sound we hear serves as a preview for the rest of the record, which sticks reasonably close to the aesthetic of “Psychic” in most respects but finds Mr. Harrington stretching out instrumentally. On Darkside’s debut, his solos on electric guitar were his most notable contribution, but several tracks here are built around his acoustic playing, lending a tinge of moody, gothic folk to the bass-heavy beat.<br />Many of these pieces flow one into the next, as they do during the band’s live show, so “Spirals” often feels more like an extended suite than a collection of songs. “Narrow Road” bleeds into “The Limit,” which features Mr. Harrington’s strummed acoustic as a rhythmic element. His chordal pattern hints at jazz and funk, but does so with the absolute minimum number of notes and gestures. And his guitar has a reverberating glow that binds it to the surrounding electronics, lending a halo effect to the instrument that conjures the softer side of Roxy Music.</td>

Mr. Kirby said the visa applicants and their families weren’t likely to stay at the military base, about 25 miles south of Richmond, for more than about three days before they are settled elsewhere permanently in the U.S.</td>

Leichty said the university system acted reasonably to protect public health when it required all of its students, faculty and staff to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 by July 1, with limited medical and religious exceptions.<br />In saying so, the judge denied an injunction sought by eight college and graduate students who claimed the university’s vaccine policy unconstitutionally infringes on their bodily autonomy and medical privacy.<br />The case is among the first to tackle the constitutionality of Covid-19 vaccine requirements at public universities.<br />Hundreds of private and public colleges and universities have adopted vaccine policies like Indiana University’s—in schools mostly clustered on the East and West coasts. Antivaccine activists have focused on public institutions, which are bound by constitutional restraints as government entities, and have brought lawsuits under the 14th Amendment and its protection of fundamental liberties.</td>

      <td>GAO says Labor Department found $12.9 billion in misspent tax dollars, an amount that likely is low</td>
      <td>States overpaid billions in unemployment assistance after enhanced and extended benefits were approved last year, according to a federal watchdog.<br />A Government Accountability Office report issued Monday said the Labor Department found $12.9 billion in overpayments made in several unemployment programs from April 2020 through March 2021, including some benefit payments that were a result of fraud.<br />In March 2020, Washington lawmakers approved an expansion of the unemployment-benefits system in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and the related economic downturn. Two programs were created: one that offered unemployment assistance to gig workers, the self-employed and others not previously eligible for benefits, and another that extended payments after state benefits were exhausted, which typically occurs in six months or less.<br />Lawmakers also provided a federally funded enhancement on top of amounts approved by states. Initially the enhancement was $600 a week. Since late December 2020, it has been $300 a week.<br />The amount of overpayments represents about 2% of the roughly $660 billion in unemployment benefits paid out by the Treasury Department during the year ended March 31, 2021, though right- and left-leaning analysts at think tanks agree with the GAO that the overpayment rate is likely understated. The Treasury figures don’t include unemployment benefits paid by states, but do include all the enhanced and extended benefits, which were federally funded.</td>

In normal times, one of the most valuable benefits of sponsorship is the ability to use the Olympics logo in advertisements. But Toyota, whose headquarters are in central Japan, said it wasn’t planning any advertising connected to the Games in its home country.<br />The auto maker is adjusting its advertising plans only in Japan, with nothing currently changing in the U.S., according to a spokesperson for NBCUniversal, which is broadcasting the Games on its affiliated television channels and its Peacock streaming platform. No U.S. advertisers have asked NBCUniversal to cancel their Olympics plans, the spokesperson added.<br />A Toyota spokeswoman said the company has been running an ad titled “Start Your Impossible” in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. In the ad, which mentions Toyota’s Olympics sponsorship, athletes drive a futuristic Toyota car. The spokeswoman said the company decided a while ago not to run the ad in Japan in light of local concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.<br />A company executive in charge of public relations, Jun Nagata, told local media Monday that the decision was made because a commercial in Japan advertising Toyota’s ties to the Olympics wouldn’t be properly understood given widespread domestic concerns about the Games.</td>
