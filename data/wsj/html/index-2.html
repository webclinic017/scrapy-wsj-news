Somehow that case isn’t making the dastardly hit list of those eager to declare that the Court is now “illegitimate,” but the Justices applied the law regardless of the policy and decided for the executive branch.(See nearby for elaboration.)<br />This isn’t a partisan Court looking for preferred policy outcomes. It’s a Court that hews to the tenets of originalism, with different shades of emphasis by different Justices. The Court’s jurisprudence is focused more than anything else on who under the Constitution gets to decide policy, not what that policy should be.</td>

      <td>As if the stakes for November’s elections weren’t high enough, President Biden now says he wants to bust the Senate’s filibuster to guarantee access to abortion. “We have to codify Roe v. Wade in the law,” Mr. Biden said this week. “If the filibuster gets in the way, it’s like voting rights, we provide an exception for this.”<br />It won’t happen before November, since the cooler heads of Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin are defending the filibuster’s moderating purpose. Democrats will no doubt forget to thank them when Republicans next take power. But how long can they hold off progressive demands? The Senate is 50-50, so if Democrats pick up two seats in the midterms, that could be the end.</td>

But then how do they explain the Court's decision to uphold a Biden immigration policy despite valid concerns about chaos at the border?<br />In Biden v. Texas on Thursday, the Court voted 5-4 to uphold the President’s decision to cancel the Remain in Mexico policy. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the three liberals. President Trump started the Migrant Protection Protocols program in 2019 to remove migrants from the U.S. while their asylum claims are processed.

So why not abandon elections and replace them with surveys?<br />Surveys turn citizens into “respondents” answering from home by phone or computer. Respondents are scientifically selected to represent a slice of the population. Answering is easy, to please Democrats, and since your qualities and attributes are selected without regard to your name, there’s no risk of fraud, which should please Republicans.

      <td>George Washington University must change its nam, says an article in, yes, the Washington Post.</td>
      <td>George Washington is a problem for George Washington University, according to the Washington Post. For years, the university in the nation’s capital has struggled with the shadow cast by President Washington’s ownership of slaves. In 2020 university officials began investigating the school’s sports teams’ name, the Colonials, because of the “ways colonists ravaged communities of color.” Last month “Colonials” disappeared. This spring, the Washington Post published an op-ed by Caleb Francois, a senior at the school, insisting that the university deal with “systemic racism, institutional inequality and white supremacy” by dropping the Washington name completely and renaming the university for Frederick Douglass.<br />George Washington certainly did own slaves. In addition to the 10 he inherited from his father, he accumulated another 65 through outright purchase over the years. When he married Martha Dandridge Custis in 1759, she brought another 84 slaves to the household at Mount Vernon. By 1786 the slaves numbered 216. In 1799, the last year of his life, Washington owned 317 men, women and children. Even in the years Washington served as the first president, he kept at least eight slaves in his home in the first capitals, New York and Philadelphia.</td>

The headlines would be 12 feet tall if another politician’s son behaved as Hunter did in a universe that also did not contain Donald Trump and his psychologically distorting effect on every media decision about what to cover and how to cover it.

      <td>Josh Hawley of Missouri came to bury originalism, not to praise it—and he was wrong. “It represents the end of the conservative legal movement,” he said on the Senate floor two years ago, referring to a decision by Justice Neil Gorsuch that redefined “sex discrimination” to protect gay and transgender employees. On Dec. 5, four days after the justices heard oral arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, Catholic University of America legal scholar Joel Alicea issued a more sympathetic warning. “The conservative legal movement finds itself at its most precarious point since its inception in the early 1970s,” he wrote. If the court declined to overturn Roe v. Wade (1973), Mr. Alicea argued, it would “likely shatter the movement,” bringing “an end to one of the most successful intellectual and political projects of the past half-century.”<br />Instead, this was the term when the conservative court arrived. Roe and its successor, Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), are no longer good law. Neither is Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971), which set up a confusing three-part test to keep religion out of the public sphere. The court expanded gun rights for the first time in 12 years. And it limited the executive branch’s power to regulate without explicit authorization from Congress.</td>

While women today have unfettered access to an array of near-infallible female contraceptive choices for consensual sex, we mostly didn’t. In hindsight, I believe we impressionable ’70s college coeds got far more societal and peer pressure to exercise sexual freedom than was wise or good for us.<br />Yet no matter how enthusiastically we explored that freedom, my friends and I never confused abortion with birth control. We recognized an overriding priority to control our reproductive capability through responsible contraception, not termination. Abortion, although legal until fetal viability, remained the most desperate of last resorts because intentionally aborting our fetus felt like murdering our baby—tragic, traumatic, life-changing and a somber choice grieved regardless of rationale.</td>

Prior to the 2015 Obama rule, the EPA had used the provision only a handful of times to regulate pollutants from discrete sources.</td>

EPA may be the beginning of the end of this baleful era. It closes the window on sweeping climate action by federal agencies without a congressional mandate.<br />In a 6-3 decision by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court held that the Clean Air Act doesn’t authorize the Clean Power Plan, or CPP, through which the Obama administration sought to force America’s electricity sector to switch to renewable sources. The plan would limit each state’s total allowable greenhouse gas-emissions under the banner of “performance standards” for power plants. That was the strategy the EPA had pursued for nearly a decade as its best option for imposing climate regulations by unilateral executive action.</td>

The Fourth reminds us of Americans’ struggle, as the Constitution puts it, to “form a more perfect union.” The stain of human bondage sparked the Civil War. The suffragettes of the 19th and early 20th centuries fought for the right to vote. Japanese-Americans during World War II were forced into internment camps. And men such as Medgar Evers and Martin Luther King Jr. paid with their lives to attain equality long denied to African-Americans. When we consider our past, sober reflection should accompany joyful celebration.</td>

Only over the past decade did it begin to become apparent that Beijing’s iron grip was tightening. After the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests demanding universal suffrage, freedoms began to erode visibly. Protests in 2019 were met with shocking police brutality.

Mr. Yass uses a different figure, $24,000 a student, perhaps because Pennsylvania school districts fund students who attend charter schools, with pass-through revenue included in their budgets.

      <td>A new ozone decision would force less drilling in America’s most productive shale reserve.</td>
      <td>President Biden and his aides keep saying they’re doing everything they can to produce more oil and gas in the U.S. Apparently they think Americans aren’t paying attention, because his Administration keeps making rule after rule to throttle production.<br />The latest comes from the Environmental Protection Agency, which has announced it may soon deem parts of the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico in “non-attainment” with its ozone standards. Green groups last spring petitioned the EPA to do this to effectively force curbs on shale fracking. The Permian is currently the most productive, and cost-effective, oil shale reserve in the U.S. It accounts for 43% of U.S. oil production.</td>

      <td>Can nominees who endorse his baseless claims about 2020 voter fraud win in November?</td>
      <td>To the exclusion of almost all other issues, Donald Trump focuses his speeches and postings on the discredited claim that he won the 2020 election, then had it stolen by massive fraud involving hundreds of thousands of votes. This continues despite Team Trump’s failure to provide compelling evidence of its fraud claims. A willingness to join Mr. Trump in condemning the 2020 results—or at least raising doubts about the outcome—often seems to be a precondition for his endorsement. This appears to be particularly true in races for secretary of state—the officer who, in most states, oversees part or all of the election process. As a result, some Republican primaries will serve as preliminary tests of how this message could play in battleground states in 2024.<br />One notable example was the race to be the GOP nominee for secretary of state in Nevada, a state Joe Biden won by 33,596 votes (2.4% of the total vote). The candidate who won, Jim Marchant, made claims of 2020 election fraud the centerpiece of his primary. “My work exposing” it, he said, “has a lot of people very nervous. The Communist/Socialist/RINO Cabal is coming after me hard.” Mr. Marchant organized the America First Secretary of State Coalition, or AFSOSC, to back like-minded candidates. He is more radical on this point even than Mr. Trump, arguing that “your vote hasn’t counted for decades, you haven’t elected anybody.” The president tends to confine himself to lamenting his own loss.</td>

      <td>Other countries should be careful about allowing sales of farmland to hostile powers.</td>
      <td>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is causing global hunger and galloping food prices, and future supply-chain disruptions will bring more such misery. Many countries are realizing that they should grow more food, but they’ve sold much of their best land to China, which uses it to feed its own population. A few years ago, China bought nearly one-tenth of Ukraine’s arable farmland. Countries should start screening those seeking to buy their farmland, as they already do with prospective purchasers of sensitive technology.<br />“There can be no effective solution to the global food crisis without reintegrating Ukraine’s food production, as well as the food and fertilizer produced by Russia, into world markets,” United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said on June 24, warning that the world faces multiple famines this year and worse in 2023. But Ukrainian grains and other foods won’t be able to enter the world market any time soon because the sea route remains blocked by Russia. Ukraine is sending some grain to world markets via rail to Poland and Romania, but doing so is laborious and expensive. Before the war, around 90% of Ukraine’s grain was exported via its sea ports.</td>

While the ill effects of Covid have dissipated, the ports’ increasing need for automation to stay competitive has sharpened the labor strife that has long afflicted them.<br />On Friday the collective-bargaining agreement covering longshore labor along the West Coast expires, and with it the contract’s “no strike” clause. This will allow 22,400 dockworkers to walk off the job at any time until a new contract is ratified. Negotiations began in May and could take months. A strike would shut down 29 ports, including the adjacent Los Angeles and Long Beach complex, which handles 47% of containerized imports from China and other Asian manufacturing centers.</td>

      <td>Buying votes for the Democratic Party is the only possible justification for such an unfair giveaway of taxpayer money.</td>
      <td>Advocates for student-debt forgiveness are open about their political motivation. “It is actually delusional to believe Dems can get re-elected without acting on filibuster or student debt,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted in December. Rep. Ayanna Pressley said in May: “Democrats win when we deliver, and we have to deliver in ways that are impactful, tangible and transformative, like canceling student debt.” A headline on an April column in the Los Angeles Times read “Elizabeth Warren knows how Democrats can win the midterms. It starts with canceling student loan debt.” The New Republic signaled its agreement: “Biden’s Only Good Pre-Midterm Play: Cancel Student Debt.”<br />The debate has centered on how debt forgiveness will play politically because no other justification exists. The average student loan borrower leaves college with a debt of $28,400. What do students get for that debt? Over the course of their earning lives, those with only some college gained a lifetime earnings increase relative to someone who only completed high school that is 10 times the average debt incurred. On average a graduate with a bachelor’s degree earns 40 times as much; a graduate with a master’s earns 53 times; and a doctoral graduate earns 80 times as much as the debt. Law and medical degree holders earn almost 100 times as much. Even as the share of the population with a college degree has tripled to 30.7% from 10.5% in 1967, the value of that degree has grown. The wage premium for having a college degree has grown to 96.2% today from 55.9% in 1967.</td>

Negative perceptions of addiction too often discourage people from seeking help and result in preventable deaths. But asserting that drugs empower users desensitizes the public to the real harms of drug use. Lower risk perceptions will result in more casual experimentation. The desensitization and normalization of drug use will inevitably result in more overdoses.</td>

      <td>Well, that was quick work. In December the New York City Council passed a law to let about 800,000 noncitizens vote in local elections. Mayor Eric Adams, man of action, neither signed nor vetoed the bill, allowing it to take effect. But on Monday a state judge declared it “illegal, null and void because it violates the New York Constitution.”<br />This was always a distinct possibility, as we warned at the time. The state constitution guarantees “every citizen” the right to vote, “provided that such citizen” is 18 years old and has lived in New York for 30 days. Another constitutional section promises a process “for ascertaining, by proper proofs, the citizens who shall be entitled to the right of suffrage.”</td>

      <td>Americans got fat because of marketplace innovations—but they can help us slim down too.</td>
      <td>There’s an economic explanation for America’s obesity problem. High-calorie foods are cheaper than ever, and changes in the way we work have created a sedentary nation. Happily, the market is generating a solution: medical innovations that can reduce obesity. But insurers and the government are limiting coverage for these treatments because of shortsighted business calculations.<br />Obesity afflicts 42% of the U.S. population. Many attribute America’s weight problem to genetics, addiction or culture, but the analysis Richard Posner and I began in 1999 demonstrates that the problem is an economic one driven by technological change. Agricultural innovations have increased output and cut the price of food dramatically. Historically, it wasn’t feasible to produce all the food necessary for an obese population this large, but today we can do it easily and cheaply.</td>

For an example of the latter, look no further than the overwrought reaction to Justice Clarence Thomas’s concurrence in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, last week’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade.<br />Justice Thomas signed on to Justice Samuel Alito’s majority opinion in Dobbs, but in a solo concurrence he urges the court to reconsider prior rulings that rest on the same legal reasoning used to justify Roe. Asked about Justice Thomas’s concurrence on “CBS Mornings” Tuesday, Hillary Clinton never addressed the substance of his argument and instead resorted to pop psychoanalysis. “He’s been a person of grievance as long as I’ve known him—resentment, grievance, anger,” she told host Gayle King. Apparently, anyone who disagrees with Mrs. Clinton’s judicial philosophy needs therapy.</td>

But Mr. Jacob’s testimony and legal analysis were perfectly consistent. John Adams and Thomas Jefferson declined to invalidate questionable electoral votes.<br />Law professors Bruce Ackerman and David Fontanawrote about this in the Atlantic in 2004. They explain that on Feb. 11, 1801, Jefferson opened and counted the electoral votes, including those from the state of Georgia, which were technically defective. Jefferson did not issue a ruling on the Georgia ballot, nor did he pause the count to refer the matter back to the state. He simply counted the votes. This happened to benefit Jefferson, but Messrs. Ackerman and Fontana argue that he also acted in accordance with his understanding of the limits of his authority. “Thanks to Jefferson’s statesmanship,” they conclude, “the Republic avoided a serious crisis in 1801.”</td>

      <td>They scrap the Lemon test just as Americans discover a need for religious schools.</td>
      <td>In a pair of decisions in the past week, the Supreme Court took a major step forward in both education and religious liberty by ruling that states can’t discriminate against religion in education in the name of erecting a wall of separation between church and state. If you turn on cable news, you’d think the justices had mandated the force-feeding of communion wafers to schoolchildren. In reality, these decisions are the modest culmination of a line of cases undoing glaring judicial mistakes of the 1970s. They come at an opportune time, providing support to parents who are dissatisfied with the conventional education system, which failed their kids during the pandemic.<br />The First Amendment prohibits laws “respecting the establishment of religion.” The state of Maine (in Carson v. Makin, decided June 21) and a Washington school district (Kennedy v. Bremerton, on Monday) used this rationale to forbid, respectively, tuition assistance to parents who send their children to religious schools and quiet prayer on the football field by a high-school coach. The justices ruled that these were violations of the First Amendment’s other religion clause, which bars laws prohibiting the free exercise of religion.</td>
