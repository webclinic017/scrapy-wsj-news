The West can do more to disabuse him of the notion.<br />Hybrid attacks have already begun in Ukraine. Ukrainian security services have reported hundreds of fake bombing threats this year, prompting some schools to close. A cyber attack brought down several Ukrainian government websites this month, with a message on one hacked site warning “be afraid and expect worse.” Kyiv believes the attack was carried out by Russian ally Belarus, which complicates calculations about how to retaliate.</td>

But in another sense, the court has become increasingly homogeneous. Recent justices have come from remarkably similar backgrounds—and the president’s reported front-runner, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, would fit right in.<br />Judge Jackson grew up in a major metropolitan area, and her father was a lawyer. She would be the fifth sitting justice to fit that profile. She earned both her bachelor’s and law degrees at Harvard and would be the seventh justice with an Ivy League undergraduate degree and the eighth graduate of Harvard or Yale law school.</td>

Leaders hoped that limiting the weapons of war would reduce the risk of a second global conflagration. In one of the dark ironies of history, the naval arms-control treaties of the 1920s, which were supposed to bring peace, prohibited or limited the production of allied ships that were needed most to protect U.S. territories and eventually halt Japanese expansion in World War II.<br />Much like the allied countries that took a break from naval modernization during the interwar years, so too have the nuclear powers largely reduced their stockpiles during the current post-Cold War procurement “holiday.”</td>

      <td>When Alfred Taubman was chief executive of the restaurant chain A&W, he came up with a clever way of challenging the competition: He offered a third-pound burger for the cost of a McDonald’s quarter-pounder. The result? More than half of A&W’s customers seethed, convinced that they were being asked to pay the same amount for what sounded to them like a smaller burger.<br />One lesson from this episode: “Math is no one’s native tongue.” So observe Chip Heath and Karla Starr in “Making Numbers Count,” a close look at the challenge of understanding—and communicating—numerical claims. The authors note that, once we get beyond 1, 2, 3, our ability to grasp numbers quickly deteriorates; it’s better, if possible, to translate them into “concrete, vivid, meaningful messages that are clear enough to make numbers unnecessary.”</td>

As in 1932, the party out of power stands to benefit.<br />The U.S. isn’t alone. For the first time in history the leading industrialized nations decided to close their economies and order citizens to stay home for months at a time.

      <td>Your editorial “How to Mess Up a 5G Rollout” (Jan. 19) states, “some 20 months later, the FAA demanded to relitigate the [March 2020] FCC decision and took airlines and carriers hostage.” In fact, Transportation Department general counsel Steven Bradbury and Federal Aviation Administrator Steve Dickson voiced detailed safety concerns in a letter to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration in December 2020. NTIA, not FAA, chose not to put this letter in the FCC record.<br />Messrs. Bradbury and Dickson stated, “Recent testing and analyses reveal the potential for harmful interference to radar altimeters installed in thousands of commercial transport aircraft, general aviation aircraft, business jets, and helicopters.” Had FAA concerns been addressed by the FCC in 2020, wireless companies could have made 5G safer by lowering their transmitters’ power and adjusting their antennas’ angles, as was done in France and Canada.</td>

It’s a good lesson in the limitations of the IRS—it isn’t well-positioned to make welfare payments.<br />Although many families were caught by surprise, the potential for discrepancies in the payouts was never a secret. Lawmakers acknowledged it when they increased the credit’s value and authorized advance payments as part of last year’s American Rescue Plan. Knowing that not all the payments would line up fully with their criteria, Congress created a “safe harbor” so that two-parent families with less than $60,000 in income (and lower amounts for other types of households) wouldn’t be held liable for any miscalculations. For the many households not protected by this measure, the time for a reckoning has come. Both they and the IRS will have their hands full.</td>

      <td>Recently the Supreme Court halted the federal vaccine-or-test mandate by a 6-3 vote. This split can be explained along the usual ideological lines. The six conservatives blocked the requirement, while the three progressives approved it. But the votes can be more naturally split based on a single, evergreen question: Who decides? Indeed, that question was posed in both Justice Neil Gorsuch’s concurrence and the joint dissent by the court’s progressives. The dissenters would have allowed the executive branch to impose the mandate. The majority held that Congress, and not bureaucrats, must expressly authorize it. Justice Gorsuch’s concurrence suggested that such an intrusive power is reserved to the states and not to the federal government.<br />The question that hovered over the court’s decision is at the center of “Who Decides? States as Laboratories of Constitutional Experimentation.” Jeffrey Sutton, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, carefully delineates the conflicts, contests and overlapping claims between the federal government, state governments and the people. He is well-positioned to do so. For the past two decades, while serving as a federal appellate judge, Judge Sutton has become—in his spare time, as it were—an evangelist for the underappreciated importance of state constitutional law.</td>

Her plots, though often marked by a stunning revelation, are not where the dramatic action is; that occurs within the characters themselves. Her 2015 novel “The Past” is her masterpiece in this regard, not least in her depiction of the inner worlds of children, but her present novel, “Free Love,” approaches that work’s agility in capturing thought and feeling in flight. In this case, we have an English family in a moment of social upheaval remaking their lives, unyoking themselves from each other and from the conventions of the past.<br />The novel begins in 1967 with Phyllis Fischer dressing carefully for a little dinner she and her husband, Roger, are giving that evening. He is a high-placed civil servant in the Foreign Office; she is a housewife and stalwart of gracious living. They live in a charming Arts-and-Crafts house in a wealthy London suburb and are the parents of Colette, 15, and Hugh, 9. One guest will be coming: Nicholas “Nicky” Knight, a young man in his early 20s, the son of old friends of Roger’s parents. This is the first time the Fischers have seen him since he was a child—and we would not be surprised if it were the last. Arriving over an hour late, he is a sloppy, rude, insufferable prig. But Phyllis, at 40, is viscerally drawn to him, attracted by his disorderliness, by “his long hair, scruffy flared trousers, unbuttoned unironed shirt, drawling mockery, thin smiles, offensive opinions, deliciously offensive everything.”</td>

Steel production in the U.S. rose by 19% last year from 2020, as surging demand followed Covid-19-related shutdowns of mills and depleted the country’s steel supply.</td>

      <td>The Czech composer came to New York with the conviction that African-American melodies would be the ‘seedbed’ for their nation’s 20th-century music.</td>
      <td>In his 1918 arrangement of “Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child” for solo voice and piano, Harry T. Burleigh captures a timeless cry of desolation. It begins with a repetitive pattern in the piano that suggests a weariness of spirit, setting the tone for the coming lyrics. As the piano notes move steadily into the lower register, that weariness grows. Sharp dissonances stab through the musical texture, emphasizing the phrase “A long ways from home.” It’s a demonstration of consummate skill and sensitivity that seems to fulfill the prophecy of Burleigh’s teacher, Antonín Dvořák.<br />Interviewed in 1893, one year into his three-year stay in the U.S., Dvořák contended that “the future music of this country must be founded upon what are called the negro melodies. This must be the real foundation of any serious and original school of composition to be developed in the United States.” In “Dvořák’s Prophecy and the Vexed Fate of Black Classical Music,” Mr. Horowitz—a distinguished cultural historian of American classical music and the author of 10 books on the subject—examines Dvořák’s prophecy and what became of it.</td>

      <td>From the Dominican Republic to Jamaica, 6 under-the-radar Caribbean retreats with room rates as mild as the climate</td>
      <td>FOR ANYONE eager to thaw out this winter on a sun-drenched beach in the Caribbean, a word of caution: Brace yourself for sticker shock. Room rates at the luxury hotels have risen considerably since before the pandemic, nearly 25% in some cases, said Melissa Pugh, a Jet World Travel consultant who specializes in high-end Caribbean vacations. “Covid was very expensive for a lot of hotels and still is,” she explained, attributing the price hike, in part, to staffing shortages and enhanced cleaning and safety protocols. Yet, even the soaring costs aren’t enough to quell demand, and the region’s most popular luxury resorts are rapidly booking up.<br />Luckily, thrifty sunseekers can still find reasonably affordable, attractive accommodations scattered throughout the Caribbean. Below, we’ve zeroed in on six favorites, from a 155-room resort in Belize to a four-bedroom villa in Tobago. They may not be as well-known as their competitors but they’re well located—on or near the sea—and uncrowded. As for the current Covid regulations, each country has its own set of requirements. Be sure to inquire with the hotel before booking about the most recent vaccination and testing policies in place and check the latest health information on the CDC website.</td>
