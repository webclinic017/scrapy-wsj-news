The target of grumbling from anonymous sources, which may soon become rage, is West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who remains a holdout. But the fault here lies with Democratic leaders who misjudged Mr. Manchin as well as the political and policy moment.<br />Politico reports that some Democrats are pushing Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to bring the climate and social-spending behemoth to the Senate floor, daring Mr. Manchin to kill it. “People have to face the reality of yes or no,” Majority Whip Dick Durbin told Politico, adding Mr. Manchin’s had “more than enough time.” Go ahead, make our day.</td>

That’s what he claimed in his Wednesday press conference when asked about the point. That’s not the Fed’s business, Mr. Powell rightly said.</td>

One question: Don’t these people talk to each other? This week has seen a widening gap in monetary management in the world’s largest economies, with the potential for trouble down the road.<br />The Bank of England is the most hawkish, increasing its benchmark interest rate to 0.25% from 0.1%. It will maintain at £895 billion ($1.2 trillion) the stock of government and corporate bonds it has bought over the years under quantitative easing, but it had already stopped new purchases last year.

Others are hawks who want to shift U.S. attention to China. Both camps misunderstand the Middle East’s regional dynamics and its role in global affairs—the same mistake President Obama made 10 years ago during his “pivot to Asia.”<br />As the last U.S. soldier left Iraq on Dec. 18, 2011, the situation seemed stable. The Obama administration pitched withdrawal as the first step away from America’s long entanglement in the Middle East and toward greater engagement in Asia-Pacific. The idea was that diplomatic initiatives, regional trade deals and repositioned military assets would secure U.S. leadership in the fastest-growing and most dynamic region in the world.</td>

But everyone has an interest in equal justice under the law—a principle violated by a judge’s acquiescence to a prosecutor’s motion that he be charged as an adult. Mr. Crumbley joins tens of thousands of children shunted annually into a criminal-justice system for people over 18. Murdering four people is a horrific act. But it doesn’t transform a 15-year-old into an adult.<br />Americans have gotten tougher and meaner to our kids. Still, we continue to recognize that they’re kids. After 1899, when the first court for juveniles was established in Chicago, a separate legal system for children accused of crimes spread throughout all 50 states. Kids are believed to have less understanding of actions and their consequences; it therefore stands to reason that they should be judged less harshly. Because they are considered more responsive to efforts at reform, punishment is supposed to be set aside in favor of redemption. Research on the “teen brain” that shows that the prefrontal cortex—the part of the brain that governs impulse control, planning and consequences—isn’t fully developed until age 25 provides scientific support for treating younger defendants more leniently than adults.</td>

The wages of the company’s union workers will be directly tied to the consumer-price index, and cost-of-living adjustments will help insulate union members from the negative effects of inflation.<br />The rediscovery of these adjustments could be a harbinger.

The Salvationists have earned broad respect in American society after more than a century of charitable giving, but an internal coalition of woke ideologues now endangers the organization’s reputation.<br />This year the Salvation Army’s International Social Justice Commission published a discussion guide called “Let’s Talk About Racism.” The document, its authors say, was “designed to stimulate gracious discussion among Salvationists who choose to participate.” But its radical woke overtones against American Christians seem to make such gracious discussion impossible.</td>

      <td>The 1970 World Cup—soccer’s nirvana—is vividly remembered by those who were there. The stars were different then; the signage too.</td>

Platitudes, as much as goals,are the soccer player’s stock in trade. Yet the voices in this charming book—each one an aging football star’s—are eloquent to a man.<br />The book is billed by its subtitle as “the inside story of the legendary 1970 World Cup.” As it happens, the cup was held in Mexico that year—outside Europe or South America for the first time. The author is Andrew Downie, a soccer correspondent for Reuters, but he’s really a curator, gracefully piecing together first-person accounts from players who are still alive and inclined to share their stories.</td>

      <td>Heroic charm rescues a messy multiverse plot in the latest Marvel movie</td>
      <td>At one point in Marvel’s erratic, unshapely but ultimately endearing “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” Benedict Cumberbatch’s Doctor Strange tells Tom Holland’s Peter Parker that “the multiverse is a concept about which we know frighteningly little.” Maybe so, but that hasn’t stopped filmmakers from flogging the concept for all it’s worth. Multiverse writing means an anything-goes liberation from the grip of logic. Multiverse scripts are this fragmented era’s corrective to the Aristotelian unities of drama. They are festivals of disunity in which time-travel portals connect any universes you choose, and anyone can show up from the past, present or future on a nanosecond’s notice. Given the infinite possibilities for chaos, it’s remarkable that this sequel to “Spider-Man: Homecoming” and “Spider-Man: Far From Home” makes any sense at all. Yet it does, emotionally more than narratively. And—big surprise but not a spoiler—the whole convoluted adventure, directed with jaunty humor by Jon Watts, comes to an extravagant action climax that’s most notable for its kind heart.<br />The story picks up where “Spider-Man: Far From Home” left off. Peter’s identity as Spider-Man has been outed and he is now public enemy No. 1, blamed unjustly for the death of Jake Gyllenhaal’s Beck/Mysterio. This leads Peter; his girlfriend, MJ (sparkling work by Zendaya); and his buddy, Ned (the gentle, slow-spoken Jacob Batalon), to a discussion of celebrity and fake news: “Does any part of you feel relieved by this?” MJ asks him.</td>

      <td>A young couple with a baby on the way tries to flee to safety after androids have gone rogue and decided to wipe out the human race</td>
      <td>Is it just the timing of Hulu’s “Mother/Android” that suggests it’s a Christmas story? It is about a young woman in an advanced state of pregnancy making her way through hostile territory so she can give birth in a city that begins with a B. But the city is Boston, not Bethlehem; the woman is of the future, not the past; the antagonists are sentient robots, not Romans; and the upshot is hardly mankind’s salvation. On second thought, the timing is decidedly odd.<br />In the 1974 Mel Brooks classic “Young Frankenstein”—which was, in a far more comical way, also about the pitfalls of creating artificial life and intelligence—Marty Feldman utters the immortal line, “It could be worse. It could be raining.” At which point it rains. There’s a lot of rain in “Mother/Android.” It certainly doesn’t make things better. Could they get worse? Not for Georgia (Chloë Grace Moretz) and her boyfriend, Sam (Algee Smith), who have fled a robot uprising from some unspecified East Coast location and headed north, where boats are rumored to be taking Americans to Korea. (Which one? Who knows? The female official we eventually meet is dressed like a commissar, though.) What incited the nationwide uprising of the androids is unclear, but their new purpose is not: the extinction of the human race.</td>

Yet the radio was simultaneously full of trippy hit singles like the Byrds’ “Eight Miles High” and the Beatles’ “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds” that seductively begged to differ. Being the cautious type, I ended up steering clear of the stuff, but I wonder what I’d have done had I known that in 1958, a full decade before possession of LSD was criminalized in the U.S., Cary Grant took it every week under a psychiatrist’s care and thereafter swore by it, claiming that his hundred-odd trips effected a “beneficial cleansing” of his soul.</td>

      <td>Guillermo del Toro’s latest is visually stunning, but even Bradley Cooper and Cate Blanchett can’t energize the narrative</td>
      <td>When Guillermo del Toro’s “The Shape of Water” reached the screen in 2017, we were enchanted by the film’s physical beauty, and its darkly lyrical tale of a lonely woman’s love for a creature that others consider a monster: I described the impact as a flood tide of feelings with a mythic undertow. Now, four years later, Mr. Del Toro has taken a daring and risky turn toward an even darker side with “Nightmare Alley.” (The film is playing exclusively in theaters, as befits a production that can be appreciated fully only on a big screen.) The story starts in the tawdry glitter of traveling carnivals just before World War II. Bradley Cooper plays the hero, Stan Carlisle, a malign drifter turned silver-tongued con man, with an eerie flair that’s matched by the exceptional supporting cast. Once again the images and colors are sumptuous, yet the spectacle as a whole is lifeless, lacking resonance.<br />The director and Kim Morgan adapted the screenplay from a 1946 novel by William Lindsay Gresham. The book previously provided the basis for the 1947 film of the same name, a similarly harsh though slightly more hopeful saga, starring Tyrone Power, that was a box-office failure at the outset but went on to be considered a film-noir classic. Power saw the property as a chance to move beyond romantic roles and stereotyped swashbucklers into serious drama. Mr. Cooper’s career doesn’t need remediation, but Stan, in his hands, is a fascinating apparition who’s on screen for the first 11 minutes of the film before saying a word. (The total running time is a bloated 150 minutes.)</td>

The Biden administration also announced sanctions on Thursday that will target Chinese biotech and surveillance companies for their actions in Xinjiang.</td>

Later, as a judge from 2006 to 2013, I saw, once again, a plea-bargain rate of around 95%. This is fairly consistent across the nation, for obvious reasons. First, lawyers on both sides can, in most cases, calculate to a high degree of accuracy the probability of conviction. Likewise, they can calculate the likely sentence. It’s therefore reasonable to settle the matter with a plea bargain that reflects these two realities.</td>

Ms. Merkel placed trade and investments over security. Vladimir Putin understood she would criticize his provocation but never push sanctions or restrictions that would adversely affect the German economy.

Located in bars, cafes, bus and train stations—the same kinds of places a music-only jukebox might be found—Panorams cost a dime per Soundie.

      <td>With China disrupting global markets, the U.S. is trying to limit certain imports to protect American industry. It’s a strategy that backfired in the past.</td>
      <td>In 2018, President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on almost all aluminum and steel imported into the U.S., whether it came from allies, such as the EU, or competitors, such as China. Taken aback, the EU retaliated with tariffs on  Harley-Davidson  motorcycles, Kentucky bourbon and other U.S. exports. A trans-Atlantic rift had opened, and officials in Brussels rejected any possibility of repairing it with a “managed trade” agreement, in which governments agree on tariff-free trade in certain goods up to a specified level, after which tariffs kick in. Accepting such a deal on metals might help some European exporters, but it would undermine the principles of free trade embodied in the rules of the World Trade Organization.<br />In October, however, the EU reversed course. Under a new managed trade agreement, the EU can export 4.4 million metric tons of steel, for example, to the U.S. duty-free in 2022. Exports beyond that amount will be subject to tariffs at the same rate as under Trump. The EU agreed to the deal in part because Canada and Mexico, which had once stood with Europe on the issue, had already accepted a similar arrangement, and their steel exports to the U.S. were back to pre-Trump levels. The EU had been left standing alone.</td>

      <td>Cleveland<br />Shifting a statue’s torso less than 20 degrees may not seem a big deal, but, oh, the difference it has made in a portrayal of Krishna at age 8. Made around the year 600 in Phnom Da, southern Cambodia, the life-size figure has been on display at the Cleveland Museum of Art since its 1973 acquisition. It dates from the earliest phase of Khmer stone sculpture when artists began combining imported Indian styles with a predilection for large figures in the round and features that foreshadow those of later Angkor sculptures. The museum first displayed this masterpiece as a head and torso. Then, after a 1978-79 conservation, Krishna acquired legs reconstructed from fragments also found in Phnom Da. Facing forward, the figure stood before us, beautiful and benevolent, but somewhat bland.</td>
