The change reflects the agency’s emphasis on so-called shareholder democracy under Chairman Gary Gensler, a Democrat tapped by President Biden.

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is now in a strong position to pursue tougher policies against threats from China and North Korea.<br />Even Mr. Kishida had been lowering expectations to suggest the ruling coalition may retain only a simple majority. Other experts predicted the loss of the majority and the end of Mr. Kishida’s tenure as prime minister. There was good reason for the pessimism. The usually splintered opposition parties worked together to a greater degree than in previous elections.

More specifically, why does the United States have an adult obesity rate, 42%, that is the highest in the world outside a few small nations?<br />The simple answer is that people are eating larger quantities of unhealthy food and smaller quantities of the food that’s good for them. But precisely why have dietary patterns changed so much for the worse?

      <td>John Greenwood and Steve Hanke’s contention that excessive monetary growth is the cause of recent high inflation doesn’t hold water (“The Monetary Bathtub Is Overflowing,” op-ed, Oct. 22). Behind the 35.7% increase in M2 money supply that they cite—and attribute mainly to the Federal Reserve—lies $5.5 trillion of net spending power injected by the federal government. This was to offset the biggest short-term hit to aggregate demand in U.S. history. The Fed’s quantitative easing changes the form of the “money” (purchasing power) that deficits create, not the amount.<br />If monetary growth was the cause of the inflation, real personal consumption numbers would be rocketing, but they are barely back to pre-Covid trend. The consumer-price-index report reveals that big relative price shifts, notably for energy, food and vehicles, and base effects lie behind the rise in inflation. These are largely self-correcting in a matter of months, not years. Inflation worrywarts can sleep easy: If high inflation threatens to become persistent because the public’s inflation expectations shoot up, the Fed will counter with monetary tightening. Thanks to years of monetary easing, it has oodles of ammunition at the ready.</td>

Yet Mr. Buckley also offers a claim typical of critical race theory: “The Revolution would likely have failed had Virginia not joined in, and its slave-owning planters had been angered by Lord Dunmore’s emancipation proclamation.”<br />Lord Dunmore warned in April of 1775 that he would issue such a proclamation—an opportunistic one applying only to slaves willing to fight for the British—and did so that November. By that point, Virginia patriots had already protested against British taxes and sent delegates to two Continental Congresses. Virginia did not support the Revolution to protect slavery. To claim that it did, one must omit, embellish, play down and overemphasize, shaping the narrative to fit the agenda. This behavior plagues critical race theory and other overtly politicized frameworks for teaching history.</td>

      <td>Shares of  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc.  jumped Wednesday, reviving a favorite meme-stock trade among individual investors.<br />The home-goods retailer’s stock soared in the morning, climbing as much as 54%, before settling up 15% to end at $19.30. The move followed a series of Tuesday afternoon announcements from the company, including that it expects to complete its $1 billion share-repurchase plan two years ahead of schedule by buying a remaining $400 million of stock this year. The company also said it was launching a new digital marketplace and announced that supermarket operator Kroger Co. would begin offering some Bed Bath & Beyond products on its website and in some stores starting next year.</td>

That lesson blares out from the results not just in the key gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey, but also in places as disparate as Minneapolis, Buffalo, N.Y., Seattle and New York City.</td>

      <td>The iconic actor hosts an eight-part documentary series that tells stories of incredible getaways from Alcatraz, a Nazi POW camp and more.</td>
      <td>‘Some of the greatest stories ever told start behind bars,” says the host of “Great Escapes With Morgan Freeman,” and the actor is certainly right—several of the stories in his eight-part documentary series are so epic they’ve been told before, sometimes more than once. In fact, one of Mr. Freeman’s own better known (and most beloved) films, “The Shawshank Redemption,” is echoed throughout episode 1. But the allure of a show like “Great Escapes” is the way fact gets separated from dramatically enhanced fiction. And the perverse way it gets you to root for people you sometimes oughtn’t be rooting for at all.<br />Several of the subjects in this History Channel series are genuine heroes—notably, the inmates of Stalag Luft III, a World War II prisoner-of-war camp deep in Nazi-occupied Poland and the site of one of the most celebrated breakouts ever. (That wildly ambitious 1944 getaway of Allied airmen, examined in “Escaping Hitler” on Dec. 7, also inspired the 1963 John Sturges-directed “The Great Escape,” and fans of that film will be fascinated by the parallels, as well as by the fact that the film is never mentioned.) Other characters in other stories are considerably less sympathetic—James Earl Ray, for instance, who was known as a prison escape artist long before he was convicted for the murder of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and sentenced to 99 years at the fearsome Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary in Tennessee, a place he attempted to exit more than once.</td>

Successive mass slaughters, however, including one at Petoskey, Mich., in 1878, where approximately 50,000 birds were killed each day for nearly five months, reduced the passenger pigeon population from billions to none in a matter of a few decades. The last wild passenger pigeon was shot dead in Indiana in 1902.<br />In her thoughtful and entertaining “Life as We Made It: How 50,000 Years of Human Innovation Refined—and Redefined—Nature,” Beth Shapiro argues that humankind’s profound and protracted interventions have blurred the distinction between the natural and artificial worlds.

      <td>Need the perfect gift for a cook? Hefty pottery from British heritage brand Mason Cash—still produced today and a fixture on series like ‘Downton Abbey’ and ‘The Great British Baking Show’—has a rich history. Dig in.</td>
      <td>EACH YEAR in early November, I retrieve our rickety old step stool, a high-school project of my husband’s, and clamber up to reach the highest and deepest cupboard in my kitchen. From its shadows I slide out the large Mason Cash bowl I inherited from my grandmother. She used it, among other things, to make her Christmas pudding, stirring a silver sixpence into the mix to bring fortune to the lucky one who found it on his spoon (assuming he didn’t choke on it first). Now I use it to make my Christmas cake, a ritual that has the frisson of a reunion between old friends and a seasonal communion with my grandmother. I imagine her stirring the rum into the bowl of raisins and fruit just as I do now.<br />That bowl and I have been meeting annually for a long time. Its chunky rim, like the elevated diamond pattern around its waist, is as familiar as the contours of a remembered pet. Weighing in at 6 pounds, with a diameter of 13 inches, it has a heft that’s part of the pleasure. It’s a kitchen workhorse, designed to be used, not displayed, although it wears its long years of service like an aging actress who has studiously kept her youthful complexion. In ads, such bowls are promoted as “chip-resistant,” and who among us would not wish to claim the same? Their pleasing bas-relief decoration is functional, helping cooks secure a better hold while creaming butter and sugar or whisking eggs. The bowls—white on the inside, a pale caramel on the outside—are widely associated with Mason Cash, the company that has manufactured them for 120 years.</td>

It covers about 200 known security flaws identified by cybersecurity professionals between 2017 and 2020 and an additional 90 discovered in 2021 alone that have generally been observed being used by malicious hackers, according to a draft document detailing the order. Those flaws will be listed in a new federal catalog as carrying “significant risk to the federal enterprise.”</td>

Here are some of the key points and what they mean.<br />The world’s banks and investors can deliver the financing needed to get the world on the pathway to reducing carbon emissions. They could provide cheap and plentiful financing for green energy producers and make it more costly for fossil-fuel producers to raise cash.
