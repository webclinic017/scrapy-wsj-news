      <td>Under leftwing pressure, Biden extends the repayment pause again.</td>
      <td>Merry Christmas, student loan borrowers. Taxpayers will have to settle for airing their grievances a la Festivus. That’s the result of the Biden Administration’s decision on Wednesday to extend its payment moratorium again to May 1. Unlike its last pause through January, the Administration isn’t saying this extension is final—probably because it’s not.<br />The Cares Act in March 2020 relieved borrowers from making payments on $1.6 trillion in federal student loans and waived interest accrual through September 2020. President Trump extended the pause through January despite no legislative authority to do so. Mr. Biden compounded the injury to taxpayers and the separation of powers by extending it through this September.</td>

      <td>One might expect that a country suffering a generational energy crunch would be trying everything possible to expand supply. Yet Germany is proceeding with the closure of three nuclear power plants—around half of the country’s nuclear power generation—by the end of the year.<br />Ten years ago 17 nuclear reactors produced about a quarter of Germany’s electricity, but the 2011 Fukushima accident prompted former Chancellor Angela Merkel to phase out nuclear. Six reactors remain: Three will close this month, with the remaining three ceasing operations next year. It’s hard to think of a more self-defeating policy on economic, climate and geopolitical grounds.</td>

The judge also absolved Hertz of any obligation to make premium payments on bonds that were scheduled to come due in 2022 and 2024 to compensate for the early retirement of those debts.</td>

Days before the groom’s ambush, the progressive district attorney claimed that “we don’t have a crisis of lawlessness, we don’t have a crisis of crime, we don’t have a crisis of violence.” The remarks infuriated Philadelphia residents, who are the victims of the crime he said doesn’t exist.</td>

      <td>Despite what Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin says, cyber operations neither trigger perilous conflict nor do they make conflict more violent.</td>
      <td>The U.S. government has made some bad assumptions about cyberspace over the past decade. The Obama administration, fearing escalation by U.S. adversaries, handcuffed U.S. military cyber operations by requiring executive approval for even small-scale cyberattacks. That reluctance to act meant that when Iran attacked the U.S. financial system or when North Korea attacked Sony Pictures, the administration had few options for retaliation. This restraint was most damaging on the eve of the 2016 election, when the Obama administration reportedly chose not to attack Russian networks despite knowing about disinformation operations from Russian cyber operatives. Some experts have suggested this was because of fears that Russia might escalate in response.<br />The Trump administration veered in the other direction, promising to “defend forward” and “persistently engage” without saying what actions the administration viewed as off-limits for itself and its adversaries. While public reports suggested that the administration conducted some limited offensive cyberattacks, certain senior officials suggested the U.S. wanted to do far more, and the  New York Times  reported that the U.S. even targeted the Russian power grid.</td>

He’s backed incumbents, primary challengers and candidates in open races for everything from the Senate and House down to state representatives and even a small-town mayor’s office, often with statements offering his “Complete and Total Endorsement!”<br />Mr. Trump is likely doing this to maintain his hold over the GOP and keep open the possibility of a 2024 White House run.

My experience in an orphanage near Statesville, N.C., where I lived from age 10 to 18 in the 1950s, wasn’t at all like that.<br />Christmas at my orphanage began the week before Thanksgiving. All 225 girls and boys, ranging in age from 2 to 18, gathered in our cottages to write to Santa Claus. There were rules for those letters.  We could list three (and only three) suggestions for a gift that Santa would leave under our cottage tree on Christmas. Each gift could cost no more than $10 (or about $105 today), which we considered generous.</td>

They were paragons of industrial ingenuity and wealth—Ford was the richest man in the country, Edison the paramount inventor—even more renowned than their latter-day counterparts, Elon Musk and the late Steve Jobs. Ford and Edison—accompanied by Harvey Firestone, the tire mogul, and a retinue of servants—would take “camping trips” by car each summer to promote auto sales (and themselves) that were covered by reporters as big news. And in the early 1920s, they collaborated for a time in one of the oddest episodes in the saga of American enterprise.<br />The story of this pair’s vain effort to build a utopian garden city powered by a mammoth hydroelectric dam at Muscle Shoals, Ala., is all but forgotten. Now it’s been disinterred by Thomas Hager, in “Electric City: The Lost History of Ford and Edison’s American Utopia,” a well-researched, crisply written account tinged with irony.</td>

This is the bank robber hitting a second bank to hand out refunds to the victims of his first bank robbery.<br />Does this even accomplish its objective? Mr. Meyers implies that racial preferences help those who were the victims of prior discrimination. But take a good look at the demographics of African-Americans who get in to Harvard, and notice the high percentage with recent family from the Caribbean or Africa, or family from the upper-middle class. Middle- and working-class first-generation Asian-American kids, whose parents were refugees from communism, are excluded to make spots for upper-class kids of a higher racial caste.

Chairman Jerome Powell last week sought to finesse that delicate trade-off by ratcheting up the rhetoric without taking any specific actions to contract the monetary base. The official statement issued by the Federal Open Market Committee—euphemistically called “forward guidance”—amounts to little more than posturing in the thin hope that elevated inflation rates will self-resolve in the coming months. If fiscal stimulus wanes and supply-chain bottlenecks clear, the Fed’s oft-stated determination to be “patient” before raising interest rates would seem vindicated.</td>

Any Russo-Ukrainian war is likely to be bloody for the combatants, result in a wave of refugees heading west, and further destabilize an already precarious regional security situation. Nonetheless, as diplomatic efforts unfold, there are good strategic reasons for the West to stake out a hard-line approach, giving little ground to Moscow over its demand to forsake Ukrainian membership in Western institutions and halt military activity in Central and Eastern Europe. Rather than helping Russian President Vladimir Putin back down from the position he’s taken, the West ought to stand firm, even if it means another Russian invasion of Ukraine.</td>

      <td>IMPERFECTIONISTS, REJOICE. Sean Scherer and other professionals in the realm of aesthetics see interior design embracing flaws in 2022. The founder of curiosity shop Kabinett & Kammer, in Franklin, N.Y., cites a surging interest in chipped and crazed ironstone china as an example. “In the past, people wanted pure white and pristine,” he said. Now his customers are hankering for the opposite—a “timeworn and cozy feel.” Sleek, mass-made items and chilly finishes like glass are being ghosted. Instead, people are gravitating toward handmade finishes, plantlike paint colors and friendly architectural curves. “We are dying for warmth, coziness and colors that make us feel grounded,” said Los Angeles designer Peti Lau, who observes cool tones’ fading fast. Here, the incoming trends that were highlighted most often by the hundreds of designers we polled—as well as those they believe are bowing out.<br />While hand-painted floor tiles seemed charming not so long ago, the colorful quadrilaterals won’t be a big part of the finishes arsenal in 2022, predicted Charlotte, N.C., interior designer Gray Walker. “The line between indoors and outdoors will continue blurring,” and such ornamentation is too busy to jibe with the simplicity of the natural world, she said. Mosaic floors, too, had their moment, said Brooklyn-based architect Adam Meshberg, “until people started spending more time at home and opted for serene spaces that were easy on the eyes.”</td>

Mikhail Gorbachev stepped down as president, yielding to Boris Yeltsin, who raised the flag of the Russian federation over the Kremlin. Many Americans, then and now, concluded that U.S. policies had helped to destroy the “evil empire,” which was secondarily weakened by economic and military burdens as well as by national revolt in the republics.<br />And yet, three decades on, these widely believed explanations for the collapse of the Soviet Union are less persuasive. The cost of Soviet military commitments, for example, wasn’t insupportable in 1990: The U.S.S.R. withdrew from Afghanistan and Eastern Europe with its army in good order and still the largest in the world. Soviet military expenditures stood at 15% of GDP and were remarkably cost-effective compared with those of the West. Oil prices plummeted near the time of the collapse, but that shock wasn’t decisive, as Soviet oil and gas pipelines to Western Europe remained a crucial long-term asset. Soviet foreign debt stood at $65 billion in 1991, a big jump from a few years earlier, but Moscow had to pay only $3.9 billion in arrears.</td>

He advised Americans not to abandon their holiday plans if they’re vaccinated, though he repeated his dire warning about the unvaccinated. He even offered a grace note to Donald Trump for producing the vaccines, which must be a first.</td>

Footfalls on an upper floor. The squawk of a blue jay outside. “Sound is all around us—inescapable and invisible,” writes Nina Kraus in “Of Sound Mind: How Our Brain Constructs a Meaningful Sonic World.” Our sense of hearing, she tells us, “is always ‘on.’ ” We ignore it at our peril.<br />According to Ms. Kraus, a neuroscientist at Northwestern University and the founder of its Brainvolts auditory neuroscience laboratory, most people would choose sight over hearing—they would rather live in silence than in darkness. But, she reminds us, it is sound that provides us with our greatest means of communication. She quotes the author and activist Helen Keller: “Blindness disconnects us from things,” but “deafness disconnects us from people.” Sound is also a source of great nostalgic power. Ms. Kraus writes: “The neighborhood birds, the sounds of leaves rustling, the distant church bell, the abrupt hiss-honk of the city bus’s air brakes and the pick-up basketball game down the street. . . . These all impart a sense of place, a place of belonging.”</td>
