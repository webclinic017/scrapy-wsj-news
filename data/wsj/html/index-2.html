      <td>The 1942 Battle of Guadalcanal proved the critical importance of the Solomon Islands for Pacific security. China’s rulers have studied this history. As Beijing seeks to displace the U.S. as the dominant power in the Pacific, it’s establishing a small police presence on the Solomon Islands that could easily grow. This development underscores the importance of U.S. engagement with the small but strategic sovereign states dotting the world’s largest ocean.<br />The besieged government of Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said last week it is accepting “shields, helmets, Batons and other non lethal” gear from China. “The Government has agreed to accept the Peoples’ Republic of China’s offer of riot equipment and six Police Liaison Officers to equip and train Royal Solomon Islands Police Force,” its statement said.</td>

A better measure, the one on which the Federal Reserve focuses, is called the deflator for core personal-consumption expenditures, or core PCE. This price index excludes food and energy, because they are so volatile and far beyond the Fed’s control. It registered a 4.7% inflation rate over the past year.</td>

Five years later he manufactured the first affordable car for middle-class Americans, the Model T, having first devised the assembly-line process to mass produce this epoch-making innovation.<br />Few Americans, however, associate the Ford name with agricultural and farm-class vehicles. Yet years before he conceived the Model T, Ford—who was born on a farm near Dearborn, Mich., in 1863—was obsessed with “making some kind of a light steam car that would take the place of horses,” especially, as he later wrote in his memoirs, “to attend to the excessively hard labour” of plowing, threshing and pulling. Nothing, his first-hand experience had taught him, could be “more inexcusable than the average farmer, his wife, and their children drudging from early morning until late at night.”</td>

      <td>“The Forever Student Loan Emergency” (Review & Outlook, Dec. 23) shows there’s more than one way to skin a taxpayer. Recurring White House fiats for suspension of student loan payments, without accrual of interest, is a nifty alternative to not-yet-passable legislation that permanently cancels most or all of the $1.6 trillion in debt. The slow drip out of Treasury—and ultimately taxpayer pockets—is more palatable than wiping $1 trillion off the books in one fell swoop with legislation that forgives as much as $50,000 in debt per student.<br />Recurring suspensions of student loan payments are, in concept, similar to the entitlement-program phaseout chicanery baked into Democrats’ stalled Build Back Better bill. The agenda is to make the programs permanent by whetting the appetites of new benefit recipients. They would then demand permanence and vote for Democrats to make it happen.</td>

The suitcase was packed with luxuries unimaginable to everyday Poles: fine German coffee, Swiss chocolates, Hermès scarves and French perfumes.

One elderly woman who had traveled from New Jersey to my father’s Brooklyn, N.Y., office explained that many practices near her home had closed. Those that remained open were so overwhelmed that she would have had to wait eight months for an appointment.<br />This shouldn’t be surprising. According to a 2020 survey by the Physicians Foundation, 12% of all U.S. doctors either closed their offices during the pandemic or were planning to do so within the year. Some 59% agreed that the pandemic would “lead to a reduction in the number of independent physician practices in their communities,” and half agreed that “hospitals will exert stronger influence over the organization and delivery of healthcare as a result” of the pandemic.</td>

The latest campaign pushes the absurd claim that China enjoys democratic government at home while deriding as undemocratic the world’s real democracies.<br />The Communist Party shows no inhibition about spreading falsehoods in this new misinformation effort. Published last September, a government white paper broadly publicized in China claimed that the Chinese people “experience a broad, thorough and true democracy.” In October, Xi Jinping said China’s National People’s Congress “guarantees that the people are masters.” In other instances, Mr. Xi has claimed, that “when the people call out, I listen,” and dismissed American democracy, saying people “go into hibernation” after elections and otherwise have “no way to exercise their rights to speak.”</td>

      <td>An airy Catskills getaway is all comfort, with nary a camp cliché in sight</td>
      <td>“RUSTIC YET refined.” This was the aesthetic goal of New York City firms NevelHaus Development and INC Architecture & Design when they began designing and building their contemporary Catskills cabins. The homes would be woodsy country houses for sophisticated design consumers escaping the city, said Adam Rolston, creative director and managing partner at INC. The first of the 19 sustainable residences in New York’s Sullivan and Ulster counties went to Broadway musical “Hamilton” star Phillipa Soo and her actor husband Steven Pasquale.<br />“We flipped for how grand it feels despite its modest footprint,” Mr. Pasquale said of the three-bedroom home, which weighs in at under 2,000 square feet. The 30-foot ceiling in the open plan of the public rooms contributes to its character as a small house with a big personality. The project is, in fact, a study in embracing dichotomies. The shape of the structure is inspired by the traditional black barns that dot the rural Pennsylvania landscape. But instead of the rough-hewn walls and naked beams of standard barn conversions, “the big, open, two-story space has an all-loft feeling, which brought a modern flavor,” said Mr. Rolston. The next polarity to be negotiated: balancing forward-thinking design with the coziness that one expects in a forest getaway. The solution came in marrying contemporary forms with organic, touchable materials—for example, a streamlined living-room sofa upholstered in a rough weave and pine floors that retain their humble character with visible knots.</td>

Stanley Young, a scientist appointed to the EPA’s Science Advisory Board in 2017 and reappointed in 2020 for another three-year term. In March new EPA Administrator Michael Regan—20 days on the job—abruptly sacked the entire board and the agency’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee. He then restocked both with green cheerleaders. Any interested person or organization can make nominations for the board and committee, and Mr. Young, who worked as a statistician for the pharmaceutical industry, was renominated for both bodies after the purge.

      <td>While occupying Virginia the day after its secession, the dashing Col. Elmer Ellsworth became the North’s ﬁrst celebrity martyr.</td>
      <td>The flamboyant young Civil War hero Elmer Ellsworth went from household name to household god in a matter of months by paying for his irrepressible bravado with his life. First, even before the war began, the spruce, handsome Ellsworth had become a 19th-century-style American idol for public displays of martial showmanship that fit, and fueled, the militant spirit that overtook the country in the run-up to actual hostilities. Then, barely 24 years old, Ellsworth became the war’s first prominent Union casualty, whose death ignited mass mourning rivaled only by the public response to Lincoln’s assassination four years later.<br />Yet, as Meg Groeling acknowledges in her straightforward, deeply researched biography, the first in 60 years, Ellsworth is now largely forgotten by the general public. The author is onto something when she asserts that, in his day, the thrilling public saber-rattling that Ellsworth engaged in “readied the North for the eventuality of the war itself.” A veteran teacher and writer specializing in military history, Ms. Groeling has mined Ellsworth’s letters, his mother’s diaries and a host of original newspaper accounts to forge a vivid inquiry into his onetime star appeal.</td>

Could it be that D.C. residents have already grown tired of protest tourists? Possibly, but Washington is just one part of a larger trend. Looking at nationwide data, a clear picture emerges of people fleeing heavily governed jurisdictions for those with lighter bureaucratic burdens.</td>

But re-creating the sense of peril one felt—while trying to buy an Orange Julius, say, or get to a commuter bus circa 1979—is an essential element in what is in turn a serial-murder story, a police procedural and a cultural critique.<br />No one says it quite out loud, but underlying all else in this season 2 kickoff of Mr. Berlinger’s “Crime Scene” is the paradox of legislating morality: The more you criminalize, the more crime goes up. It was the great lesson of Prohibition. It’s also the unavoidable conclusion of a story that begins—in this telling at least—in flames.</td>

Those numbers are substantially in excess of the national vaccination rate. Yet the NFL, NBA and NHL are all setting league records for positive cases.<br />How is this possible? Athletes, and all of us, were told that if everyone were vaccinated, Covid cases would plunge and we could return to normal life. Yet there were more U.S. Covid cases on Dec. 24, 2021, than there were on Dec. 24, 2020.</td>

The actor initially claimed to have been attacked at 2 a.m. on the coldest day of the year by two Trump-supporting white guys who were walking through center-city Chicago wearing MAGA hats and carrying a rope noose and a full bottle of bleach. These conservatives recognized Mr. Smollett from “Empire,” the hip-hop musical TV series, and opened a street fight with him by declaring Chicago “MAGA country!” Bizarre.<br />Yet, as Holman Jenkins, Jr., writes in “Jussie Smollett’s Enablers Weren’t His Friends” (Business World, Dec. 18), leading left-wing figures could not be seen “hinting even slightly that there was anything fishy.” Joe Biden tweeted: “We are with you, Jussie.” Vice President Kamala Harris said Mr. Smollett is “one of the kindest, most gentle human beings I know” and “the attempted victim of a modern-day lynching.”</td>

Yet rather than risk speculating on the root causes of the gap, educators and administrators take a collective sigh of relief when the measures of the gap evaporate from the educational domain.<br />California has worked assiduously to eliminate the achievement-gap smoke alarms: no standardized testing at the state or local level, no high-school competency tests or exit exams, no benchmark testing and crimp SAT results.</td>

By the time the travel ban was instituted on Nov. 26, it was clear that the Omicron variant not only had spread widely in Africa but had already reached the U.S. and the European Union. The EU has yet to remove its travel restrictions, a punishing political strategy with no scientific basis.<br />When it comes to science, South Africa is at the forefront of genetic surveillance and viral structural analysis. The country has a stellar medical research community; the first heart transplant was performed there in 1967. South Africa was a beacon of transparency when it came to Omicron, the opposite of China’s behavior at the beginning of the pandemic. That makes it especially unfortunate that the U.S. and EU singled out South Africa, and at the heart of its summer tourist season. The message: being forthcoming on behalf of science led to punishment rather than reward.</td>

      <td>It is too bad  Sony  can’t make a new Spider-Man movie every weekend.<br />The webslinger’s latest outing—“Spider-Man: No Way Home”—has now grossed more than $467 million domestically and topped $1 billion world-wide at the box office since its Dec. 17 release. That makes it the biggest hit of the pandemic period by far, with the movie selling more than twice as many tickets as the next runner-up,  Disney ’s  “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” according to the box-office tracking site The Numbers. That level of business would qualify the movie as a hit even pre-pandemic; only 45 other movies in history have topped the $1 billion mark globally.</td>

      <td>New South African study suggests infection with Omicron can protect against infection with Delta</td>
      <td>Governments and policy advisers are showing signs of taking a lighter touch toward the fast-spreading Omicron variant, reducing quarantine times and in some instances foregoing social-distancing restrictions as they try to keep their economies moving.<br />The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday reduced the recommended isolation period for people infected with Covid-19 to five days from 10. The new guidance reflects growing evidence that people with the virus are most infectious one to two days before the onset of symptoms and two to three days afterward, the agency said, as well as concern over the disruption staff outages are causing in the travel and healthcare sectors.</td>

      <td>Investors have become so conditioned to Fed’s low-rate regime that it might be hard for them to bet on yields going up</td>
      <td>It can be hard to make sense of why long-term U.S. Treasury yields are so low. But after so many years where yields were, in retrospect, too high, it is understandable why investors might hesitate to bet on them going up.<br />In theory, the 10-year Treasury yield is supposed to reflect what investors think the return on money continually invested at the risk-free overnight rate set by the Federal Reserve will be, adjusted for a “term premium”—the fudge factor investors build into the yield as insurance against the risk that their rate forecasts are wrong. Lately, yields have reflected investors’ view that the main risk to their forecasts is that they prove to be too high.</td>

      <td>It was supposed to be a stock picker’s market.<br />A late 2020 rally by smaller and cheaper stocks, culminating with the meme-stock craze that started in January, raised hopes that active investing would stage a comeback this year. But as 2021 draws to a close, most professional stock pickers find themselves in familiar territory: trailing the benchmark S&P 500 index.</td>
