      <td>Former President Barack Obama is planning a 60th birthday party with hundreds of guests at his Martha’s Vineyard vacation home this weekend, as the nation brings back some Covid-19 precautions to combat a rising tide of Delta-variant cases.<br />Mr. Obama’s gathering will take place outdoors and will follow all local, state and federal health protocols, including a testing regime managed by a public-health professional, according to a person familiar with the plan.<br />The party, earlier reported by The Hill, has triggered some online criticism among conservatives and charges of hypocrisy, reflecting the nation’s political polarization over the pandemic and the debate over the proper measures to address Covid-19.<br />Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, a senior Republican in the House, suggested in a tweet Monday that Democrats would treat such an event as dangerous if it were held by former President Donald Trump.<br />Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, stressed that the event would be outdoors, when asked Monday about the medical considerations and whether average Americans should hold such large parties.</td>

      <td>The CDC should scrap its confusing guidance and make vaccination the only priority.</td>
      <td>Once upon a time Joe Biden set priorities. Shortly before he was sworn in, he unveiled a Covid plan that set a goal of vaccinating 100 million people in the first 100 days of his presidency. He later increased that to 160 million by July 4. In May he added a sweetener: “If you’ve been fully vaccinated, you no longer need to wear a mask. Let me repeat. If you are fully vaccinated, you no longer need to wear a mask. . . . The safest thing for the country is for everyone to get vaccinated.”<br />That focus is gone. Last Tuesday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed its earlier guidance. Now the CDC advises even the vaccinated to mask up indoors in areas of the country with high amounts of transmission—and it recommends masking for everyone, including children, in K-12 schools.<br />The CDC’s shift, and with it President Biden’s, has revived the debate over masks and whether government should mandate masking, vaccination or both. Conspicuously absent is a notion fundamental to public health: priorities.<br />For all his stormy press conferences, President Trump did manage to set a priority for Covid-19. This was to develop a vaccine before the end of 2020, which he facilitated by setting up Operation Warp Speed.<br />Notwithstanding his pieties about America’s need for grace, Mr. Biden has still never been able to give Mr. Trump credit for this achievement. Even so, he has implicitly recognized the priority of vaccination by setting targets and dates, making them among his most recognizable Covid goals.</td>

      <td>International bodies have made Covid worse, while Big Pharma saved the day.</td>
      <td>Appearing on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” in 2014, Bill Clinton said that an invasion from outer space might be “the only way to unite us in this incredibly divided world of ours,” musing “how all the differences among people on Earth would seem small if we felt threatened by a space invader. . . . Everybody gets together and makes nice.” Ronald Reagan had the same idea, telling the United Nations General Assembly in 1987 that “I occasionally think how quickly our differences world-wide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat.” The Biden administration is betting the farm on the belief that any world-wide problem will do the trick, with global threats ranging from climate change to cyberwar on the increase. But the course of the Covid-19 pandemic to date suggests these hopes are misplaced.<br />Far from uniting the world, the coronavirus renationalized human life. It’s not only that most of humanity has been cooped up inside its national borders, with a handful able to travel. Vaccination has become a national matter, with your access to lifesaving shots dependent more on where you are than anything else. International efforts at vaccination have largely failed—and the resulting bitterness and feelings of alienation in poor countries is likely to leave an enduring imprint on world politics.<br />The World Health Organization has been a shame and a disgrace, from its initial silence over China’s coverup of early data on the outbreak through its unreasoning hostility toward Taiwan and its collusion with Beijing’s efforts to discredit the lab-leak hypothesis. The premier international health agency has failed.<br />Covax, the much-touted international program aimed at providing vaccines to citizens of countries too poor to purchase adequate supplies on the open market, has also fallen abysmally short. According to WHO statistics, of the 3.7 billion vaccine doses distributed around the world, less than 2% have been given in Africa.<br />Rather than coordinate their policies, countries have followed their interests at every turn. From China’s protective coverup of the emerging threat, to the squabbles between the U.K. and European Union over vaccine deliveries, to India’s decision to prohibit the export of vaccine doses originally intended for global distribution, leaders have consistently put their own countries (and political fortunes) ahead of promoting a unified global response.</td>

      <td>Though a return to the old system isn’t likely, the Fed’s management of the fiat dollar has been worse.</td>
      <td>President Richard Nixon ended the redeemability of dollars for gold and ushered in the fiat money era on Aug. 15, 1971. Many economists look back on the occasion with delight, agreeing with John Maynard Keynes that the gold standard was “a barbarous relic.” Today nearly all economists believe the U.S. economy has performed better under fiat money than it would have with the gold standard.<br />This conventional wisdom is wrong. The gold standard wasn’t perfect, but the fiat dollar has been even worse. Fifty years after the Nixon shock, it is worth remembering how well the gold standard worked.<br />Under a genuine gold standard, a monetary unit is defined as a specific quantity of gold. Coins, notes and deposit balances are used in transactions. Competition among gold miners adjusts the money supply in response to changes in demand, making purchasing power stable and predictable over long periods. The threat of customers redeeming notes and deposits for gold discourages banks from overissuing, ensuring that redeemable claims to gold generally circulate at par with gold.<br />The 1944 Bretton Woods system, which Nixon ended, wasn’t a genuine gold standard. U.S. citizens had been prohibited from holding any monetary gold since 1933, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued executive order 6102. Bretton Woods limited redemption of dollars for gold to foreign governments, which issued their own currencies and conducted monetary policy to support fixed exchange rates with the dollar.<br />Fiat dollars aren’t constrained by the supply of gold or any other commodity. The Federal Reserve can expand the money supply as much or as little as it sees fit, regardless of changes in money demand. When the Fed expands the money supply too much, an unsustainable boom and costly inflation follow. When the Fed expands too little, the economy falls into recession.</td>

      <td>Exhausted, I gave in and tried a prong collar. I’m glad I did.</td>
      <td>The sticky note on the door jamb did us in. “Your dog has been barking since 10:55 a.m. I can hear it through the walls.” My wife and I had taken a short trip to the grocery store and left our Irish setter, Charley, alone in her cage. She barked wildly in our absence.<br />Charley’s bad behavior has added a lot of stress to our lives. By the time the note appeared, we were sick of being pulled down the street during walks and barked at during video calls. Dogs are fun to have and dote on, but we weren’t enjoying ours much, especially because we felt we couldn’t leave her alone.<br />So we went nuclear. We bought a prong collar and an e-collar, considered forbidden tools by most dog trainers and pet lovers.<br />People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals’ description of the prong collar captures the popular sentiment: “Prong collars are designed to punish dogs for pulling by inflicting pain and discomfort. They can cause serious physical and emotional damage to dogs and should never be used.”<br />In practice, the prongs tighten around the dog’s neck when they pull at the leash, giving the animal a clear incentive to walk by your side. If it really hurt, my dog, who is a bit of a sissy despite being an athletic 45 pounds, would yelp. She hasn’t yet.</td>

      <td>Remember the day, before trolls and bullies poisoned the well, when Facebook and Twitter were credited with giving a voice to the powerless?</td>
      <td>In a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, it’s difficult to recall the excitement that greeted the announcement by Steve Jobs of the first iPhone in 2007. In “Always On: Hope and Fear in the Social Smartphone Era,” BBC technology journalist Rory Cellan-Jones takes us back to a time of naive enthusiasm about the possibilities of smartphones and social media. “This, then, was the golden age of optimism about the impact of these mighty new tools of the digital era,” he writes. “It was as if we had happened on a new land of promise, a place where the old rules and hierarchies did not apply.”<br />Mr. Cellan-Jones, who covered the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s in the U.K., takes a refreshingly skeptical outsider’s view of Silicon Valley and its titans. Unlike many American reporters at that time, he wrote openly about Jobs’s bumptiousness. He was horrified when an American journalist hugged Jobs’s successor, Tim Cook, during a television interview. Recalling an interview with a Facebook executive, Mr. Cellan-Jones observes that “the company and its founder were not arrogant, but it seemed to me they had an almost unshakable belief that they were smarter than the rest of us and could ignore external advice.”<br />Mr. Cellan-Jones spurns tech-industry boosterism but grants that “the predictions that fuelled the first boom—that the internet would transform every aspect of our economy and society—have proved correct.” Today, he notes, “the promise is that not just people but every object imaginable—cars, lamp posts, dustbins, every item in a grocery or clothes shop—will be hooked up to the network.”<br />Mr. Cellan-Jones is an amiable narrator and, although the book is ostensibly focused on smartphones and social-media platforms, he ranges wider, covering subjects such as cryptocurrency, autonomous cars, space exploration, 5G and artificial intelligence. At times he sacrifices depth for breadth, and some chapters stray far enough away from the book’s supposed subject to seem more like filler.<br />The most engaging sections in “Always On” recall the author’s interviews with tech visionaries and internet celebrities, now with the benefit of hindsight. “There was a time when Twitter and its much bigger and more powerful Californian neighbour Facebook were credited with delivering a voice to the powerless, even enabling the Arab Spring, and allowing superstars and their fans or politicians and citizens to talk to one another directly rather than via an old media intermediary,” Mr. Cellan-Jones writes. “But very quickly the well was poisoned. Trolls and bullies, fraudsters and bigots took to these new platforms with gusto.”</td>

      <td>In a blow to Beijing, Manila will keep hosting U.S. forces.</td>
      <td>Too often U.S. diplomatic meetings with allies end with vague promises and high-minded boilerplate. So credit to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin for concluding his visit to the Philippines Friday with a concrete strategic success: Manila announced it would officially restore the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) that makes it easier for American troops to operate on the archipelago.<br />That’s a blow to China’s strategic ambition to push America’s military out of the Western Pacific. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte announced early last year he was terminating the 1998 VFA. Though the U.S. and the Philippines have been treaty allies since 1951, the mercurial Mr. Duterte has courted Beijing and wants to play the two largest Pacific powers against one another.<br />Yet China’s maritime provocations in Philippine-claimed waters have intensified in the months since Mr. Duterte threw the future of the VFA into doubt. Standing next to Mr. Austin in Manila, the Philippine defense minister announced that Mr. Duterte had “decided to recall, or retract, the termination letter for the VFA.”<br />Mr. Austin said the agreement, which governs the legal status of U.S. troops in the country, “enables us to respond swiftly and seamlessly to disasters or crisis.” It also facilitates “major training exercises such as Balikatan”—an annual collaboration between the Philippine and American militaries.<br />This alliance helps maintain Manila’s independence as China tries to dominate the waters of Southeast Asia by militarizing islands and deploying maritime militias disguised as fishing fleets. U.S. access to the Philippines is also significant because of its proximity to Taiwan, which Beijing has in its sights.</td>

      <td>An opportunity to kill South Carolina’s Blaine Amendment.</td>
      <td>A federal lawsuit in South Carolina is taking direct aim at one of the state’s uglier legacies: the Blaine Amendment embedded in its state constitution. Blaine Amendments are a relic of 19th-century prejudice, and meant to deny public funding for religious (read: Catholic) schools. More recently the state Supreme Court invoked the state’s Blaine language to throw out Gov. Henry McMaster’s plan for grants of up to $6,500 that could be applied to tuition at private and religious schools.<br />No surprise that the suit against the program was brought by a coalition that included the South Carolina Education Association, a school district and union allies. But now the opposition is fighting back in federal court. In Bishop of Charleston v. Adams, the plaintiffs—the bishop plus South Carolina’s Independent Colleges and Universities—argue that the state’s Blaine Amendment is unconstitutional and has its roots in Benjamin “Pitchfork Ben” Tillman.<br />Tillman was a white supremacist who was the driving force behind the 1895 state constitution that married anti-Catholic prejudice with efforts to suppress black voting rights. The goal of this amendment was to ensure no public funding for Catholic schools, as well as for schools, often religious, whose mission was to educate former slaves.<br />More than two-thirds of states passed Blaine Amendments, but they took a big hit in 2020 in the U.S. Supreme Court’s Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue. In a 5-4 decision, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that Montana’s amendment violated the free exercise clause of the Constitution by excluding religiously affiliated schools from an otherwise neutral tax credit scholarship program.<br />So how is South Carolina’s Blaine Amendment any different from the Montana version the Supreme Court rejected in Espinoza? The answer is a slight difference in wording. While Montana’s Blaine Amendment singled out religious institutions, South Carolina bans funding for all non-public schools.</td>

      <td>The agency will now ‘sprint’ to grant full vaccine approval.</td>
      <td>Good, if belated, news: The Food and Drug Administration has finally decided to accelerate its effort to review  Pfizer ’s  Covid-19 vaccine for full approval. The agency disclosed the news last week amid political pressure and consternation that its delay may contribute to vaccine hesitancy.<br />Pfizer’s messenger RNA vaccine was approved last year under emergency-use authorization, and hundreds of millions of doses have been administered with few negative side effects. You’d think the benefits of the vaccine would prompt the FDA to move fast on full approval. But this is a government agency with bureaucratic rules for everything, and the White House seems not to have pressed the issue until the latest bounce in Covid infections.<br />The FDA had recently put Pfizer’s application on an accelerated process to offer approval within six months, rather than the typical 10 or more. But officials told the website STAT that the agency will now initiate a “sprint” for final review. Officials said this will mean shifting resources and manpower to the Pfizer review from plant inspections and perhaps reviewing other biologic applications.<br />President Biden has said he believes full FDA approval for Pfizer’s vaccine could come as early as September or October, which ought to be possible. If the “emergency” label is holding back vaccinations at all, then there is no higher public-health priority than reassuring Americans that the accumulated evidence shows that the vaccine is safe and saves lives.</td>

Andrew Cuomo has entered its final stages and is expected to wrap up this month, people familiar with the inquiry said.<br />Investigators questioned the Democratic governor in his Manhattan office on July 17, and have since conducted follow-up interviews with at least two of his accusers, some of the people said. Last week, several outside attorneys working on the attorney general’s probe toured the Executive Mansion and the governor’s office suite at the state Capitol—the sites of some of the alleged harassment under investigation, two of the people said.<br />Mr. Cuomo requested the investigation in March after two former aides said he sexually harassed them in the workplace. Other women subsequently made accusations, including a current employee who said the governor groped her breast during an encounter at the Mansion—an accusation that Mr. Cuomo has denied.<br />Mr. Cuomo has denied he touched anybody inappropriately and apologized if his behavior made anybody uncomfortable.<br />High-level Democrats have joined Republicans in calling for Mr. Cuomo to step down, but he has remained in office, arguing that he should be afforded due process by the investigation. The findings of the probe are likely to revive debate about Mr. Cuomo’s ability to continue in office and to affect his expected bid for a fourth term next year. They will also be considered as part of a broader impeachment investigation being conducted by the New York state Assembly, lawmakers said.</td>

If the committee receives the records, it could release at least some of them to the public.<br />A judge asked the parties to lay out a time frame for written arguments by Wednesday. It could take months before the judge ultimately decides whether the Treasury Department must hand over the returns to Congress. That ruling could then be appealed.<br />The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.</td>

      <td>Merrick Garland is not a Supreme Court justice.</td>
      <td>A recent Journal editorial urged Attorney General Merrick Garland to abandon his partisan challenge to Georgia’s new duly enacted voting law, given that a recent Supreme Court decision makes his case even more likely to fail. But the AG is not only sticking with his political campaign against Georgia. Now he’s inviting leftist lawyers at the Justice Department to seek political advantage for Democrats in other states, too.<br />Attorney General Garland’s Justice Department released new guidance last week on voting statutes affecting voting methods. It reads:<br />Speaking of presumptions, a casual reader can quickly glean that the Garland Justice Department presumes Covid-related changes to be positive. Justice should forgive readers who presume a political motive when the department suggests that laws that existed until early 2020 are not necessarily legal. The natural question is why were such laws not successfully challenged before Covid? Or is there something about Covid that changes the definition of voting rights under statute and court precedent?<br />What certainly has changed lately is the pressure from progressive leftists to use the federal government to conform state voting laws to the preferences of Democrats.<br />Instead of inviting his attorneys to challenge policies not enacted between March and November of 2020, Mr Garland ought to be urging a new spirit of restraint before launching another partisan attack on state laws. Last month Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovichwrote in the Journal about his state’s 6-3 Supreme Court victory over the Democratic National Committee in a case with some similarities to Justice’s case against Georgia:</td>

Cori Bush (D., Mo.) began sleeping on the steps of the Capitol in order to call attention to the plight of renters who have lost eviction protections. Over the weekend, other Democrats joined her, while a steady stream of activists and supporters came to the Capitol to urge her on. Ms. Bush, who was once homeless and said she has been receiving calls from worried tenants, has vowed to remain until Congress fixes the problem.<br />“Something has to happen,” Ms. Bush said in a Sunday interview. “If we get a moratorium, then great, then we’re done. But right now, because we haven’t gotten it, I’m still here. And until we get it, I’m thinking that we probably want to just be here.”<br />“The House should reconvene and call this vote and extend the moratorium,” said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) on CNN Sunday.</td>

One can’t help but wonder what Mr. Colander would want the CDC to have done. Perhaps he does not want it to produce any report at all about life expectancy for 2020? Or he prefers a life-expectancy calculation with Covid-19 mortality removed because it will decline in the future? If so, the CDC would have to speculate on the rate of reduced Covid-19 deaths as well as long-term Covid-19-related death rates due to undetected medical conditions, postponed medical procedures and other conditions not currently understood.<br />No one expects the current age-specific mortality rates to be unchanged throughout a newborn baby’s life. That applies to Covid-19 mortality as well as other causes of death, such as drug use, homicides and traffic accidents.

      <td>Limit was suspended in 2019 and was reinstated automatically at the beginning of August</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The clock is ticking for Congress to reach a deal to raise the federal borrowing limit, or debt ceiling, before the government runs out of money to pay its bills some time over the coming months. The ceiling was suspended in 2019 and was reinstated automatically at the beginning of this month. Top Senate Republicans, who object to President Biden’s spending agenda, have said the GOP may line up against any effort to raise the limit this year.<br />Here’s a guide to what that means, and how the issue may be resolved:<br />Congress limits how much money the government can borrow, and once the limit is reached, lawmakers must raise or suspend the ceiling before the Treasury Department can issue more debt.<br />Before World War I, Congress approved borrowing for specific purposes, but over the next two decades, it granted more flexibility to the Treasury to issue bonds without individual, explicit legislation. By 1939, Congress effectively established an aggregate limit that delegated to the Treasury the ability to borrow up to a certain amount. The limit has been raised or modified 98 times, according to the Congressional Research Service.<br />Congress voted in July 2019 to suspend the debt limit until July 31, 2021, after which the prior limit of $22 trillion would be reset to include any new borrowing in the intervening years. On Aug. 1, the limit was reinstated at around $28.5 trillion, a figure that includes debt held by the public and debt held by government agencies. After that, the Treasury will no longer be able to tap bond markets to raise new cash.</td>

      <td>Ferrari  likes to take its time to get things right. That is a strength in creating cars that justify astronomical prices, but it also means investors can’t expect the stock to suddenly pick up speed.<br />Like the luxury industry it sometimes seems part of, the Italian sports car maker is accelerating smoothly out of the pandemic. Second-quarter operating profits reported Monday were about 15% higher than in the same period of 2019, before Covid-19 struck. It sold a similar number of vehicles, but those cars it did sell—such as the SF90 Stradale, a plug-in hybrid with a base price north of $500,000—were more expensive and profitable than those of two years ago. June was the best month ever for orders.<br />But that isn’t enough to please Ferrari investors these days. Even though the numbers beat analysts’ forecasts, the stock fell on an otherwise strong day for the market. It has drifted down this year even as both the wider automotive and luxury sectors have raced ahead.<br />What investors probably need is better visibility of Ferrari’s long-term prospects as it tackles the challenge of decarbonizing its products. They may not start to get clear answers for almost another year. In June, Chairman John Elkann made the intriguing choice of microelectronics executive Benedetto Vigna to lead Ferrari into a new technological era. On Monday, Mr. Elkann set a date in June 2022 for the new chief executive, who joins in September, to lay out his new strategy. The chairman told analysts on a call not to expect much detail before then.<br />Mr. Elkann also made clear that Ferrari wouldn’t release a  Tesla -style all-electric vehicle until it had mastered the technology. “I think the overall opportunity [of full electrification] is bigger than it was. We just need to be very disciplined in not trying to capture it too fast, but waiting to have really the best and the most unique in terms of products that we can deliver,” he said.</td>

Although not binding, he said it was a good exercise ahead of a recall vote on his presidential mandate planned for March of next year. His six-year term is due to end in 2024.</td>

      <td>Pope John XXIII is supposed to have justified the reforms of the Second Vatican Council by saying: “I want to throw open the windows of the church so that we can see out and the people can see in.” Did he consider that Catholics might be scandalized by what they saw?<br />On July 20, the Pillar, an eight-month-old Catholic newsletter, published an investigative report that rattled the institutional church, caused a prominent priest to resign from a national leadership position and ignited a fierce debate over privacy, priestly celibacy, homosexuality among the clergy and journalistic ethics.<br />The Pillar claims to have obtained a set of commercially available user data from Grindr, a location-based gay “hookup” app. By cross-referencing the Grindr data with other publicly available information, the Pillar was able to pinpoint a mobile device belonging to Msgr. Jeffrey Burrill. The device, the report claims, “emitted app data signals” from Grindr “on a near-daily basis during parts of 2018, 2019, and 2020.”<br />Msgr. Burrill, a priest of the Diocese of La Crosse, Wis., was elected general secretary of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops in November 2020. The Pillar describes him as “effectively the highest-ranking American cleric who is not a bishop.” The report claims the data show he used the Grindr app “at both his USCCB office and his USCCB-owned residence, as well as during USCCB meetings and events in other cities.”<br />The Pillar is the brainchild of former Catholic News Agency editor J.D. Flynn and reporter Ed Condon. The two journalists say they contacted the USCCB and Msgr. Burrill seeking comment, but a scheduled meeting was canceled at the last minute. Msgr. Burrill then resigned as general secretary a day before the Pillar posted its 3,000-word story.</td>

      <td>Today almost the entire establishment is steeped in the orthodoxy that has produced the malaise.</td>
      <td>There’s a consoling thought as we descend deeper into the socially disintegrating, culturally self-loathing, economically stalling dystopia of contemporary America: We’ve been here before.<br />The hegemony of today’s left-wing radicals, pursuing their ambitions to repudiate America’s historical values and remake the country in the image of some purified version of a big government, equity-enforcing, social-democratic paradise, recalls the 1970s. That decade culminated in the unique combination of economic ruin and international humiliation that defined a one-term Democratic presidency—and we know what happened next. Wait a while, the optimists say. The next Reagan Revolution is at hand.<br />History doesn’t repeat itself, despite what Marx said, but there is a pattern in the ebb and flow of historical tides. Extreme lurches in one direction tend to be self-correcting, especially when they push a nation as successful as America close to the abyss.<br />But conservatives should defer the optimism. There are surely similarities between today’s conditions and that benighted decade of 50 years ago, and you don’t have to have a wild imagination to see the Joe Biden-Jimmy Carter parallels. But there are important differences that should temper any confident predictions of an imminent new era of conservative ascendancy.<br />The 1970s were probably the last decade when existential doubts about the American project were as pronounced and debilitating as they are now. The advances of the 1960s in civil rights and economic prosperity collapsed into a tumult of social unrest and, to coin a phrase, national malaise. The racial strife that closed the previous decade continued to define much of the next one. There are echoes of today’s woke revolutionaries in the 1968 Summer Olympics, when black athletes demonstrated their antipathy to the flag and what it stood for in their own Black Power salute from the medal podium.</td>

      <td>Afterpay is an acquisition that can boost Square’s appeal to both buyers and sellers and link the two, which is what investors have been betting on</td>
      <td>With a deal to acquire  Afterpay ,   Square  won’t have to start calling itself Rectangle.<br />Given Square’s ambitions across banking and payments, one could have argued for any number of directions in a deal. It chose to do a $29 billion all-stock acquisition of Afterpay, a global leader in providing short installment payment options to shoppers, known as “buy now, pay later.” Square certainly has the equity currency to do a deal like this, with its shares trading at over 50 times book value. The question for investors is whether this was the best use of its bounty.<br />Investors have long been playing matchmaker for Square, with ideas like buying a “neobank” offering checking accounts to consumers, a major cryptocurrency wallet or a digital brokerage. With their regulatory hurdles, those businesses have deep competitive moats.<br />But this is perhaps a somewhat rarer type of acquisition that makes sense for both sides of Square’s business: For the merchant side, being able to package a “buy now, pay later” option into its existing seller tools and expanding more into large global retailers. For the consumer side, integrating more credit and shopping into Square’s Cash App. Many other mooted acquisitions would have tilted heavily toward one side.<br />One thing that had concerned investors about Afterpay and its peers was the ability of broader payments and consumer-finance players to rapidly jump into the market. Notably,  PayPal Holdings ’ launch of a Pay in 4 installment-payment option late last year is already doing well over $1 billion in quarterly volume.</td>

Mr. Wong engaged in corrupt conduct by providing entertainment to induce another person to vote for Mr. Au, who has also been charged, the agency said.<br />Hong Kong’s elections ordinance bans the conduct of providing refreshments or entertainment to favor a candidate, but in the past charges have been rare. If convicted, a person could face imprisonment up to seven years on top of a fine as much as $64,000, the ordinance says.<br />Mr. Wong declined to comment.</td>

      <td>Athletes, movie stars and the occasional flamboyant businessman are all gravitating toward tailoring that speaks louder than your standard navy or gray</td>
      <td>IN MARCH OF 2020, as Americans woke up to the reality of Covid-19’s spread, I wrote a cringingly ill-timed story about colored suiting for men. “Tailoring in strong colors once reserved for graphic T-shirts makes a full-throated declaration that this is not your father’s gray flannel suit,” I wrote, noting that readers could buy a tomato-red suit from Berluti or a lime-green one by Jacquemus.<br />In my defense, few of us knew how catastrophic the pandemic would be when I pitched the story but, by the time it was published on March 18, many readers were isolating at home in sweats. The article is now a relic of an unsteady moment. At the last minute, my editors and I attempted to make it relevant with the headline: “Skype Brilliantly in These Optimistically Hued Suits.” This was before Zoom would supplant Skype as Americans’ go-to for lockdown video-calls.<br />Suffice to say, most of us did not log onto our 2020 video meetings in resplendently colorful suits. Formal-leaning fashion trends took a backseat to comforting sweats and routine Zoom shirts as we slogged through WFH routines. But as something resembling normal life has resumed for some—and even as the Delta variant of the virus is reversing positive trends in portions of the country—vivid suits are re-entering the public eye, an expression of over a year’s worth of pent-up desire to dress more sophisticatedly and frivolously. “We already knew [colored suits] were coming pre-pandemic [and], of course, the pandemic definitely put a pause on that...That pause button has now been hit back to play,” said Michael Fisher, vice president of menswear at Fashion Snoops, a New York-based trend-forecasting company. “Right now,” he said, “color is the best way for everyone to shake things up.”<br />For those who will never grace the cover of a fashion magazine, a jolting suit shakes off the style paralysis of the past 16 months. Aleks Musika, a tailor in New York, said that his corporate clients are open to “something different, something louder,” after a “gloomy” year. Mr. Musika noted that each time cases dropped and the world seemed to be crawling back to “normal,” he’d see a surge in clients coming in for pick-me-up suits in sprightly colors. For them it’s not just a suit, it’s a wearable mood enhancer.<br />Consider as well the kaleidoscopic suits celebrities have worn in the past month or so. In early July, Colman Domingo took to the red carpet at the premiere of “Zola” in a shiny Big-Bird-yellow Dolce & Gabbana suit. At the Cannes Film Festival, “The Crown” star Josh O’Connor wore a flamingo-pink, double-breasted suit by Loewe, though he was one-upped by jury president Spike Lee, who not only wore a blaring pink  Louis Vuitton  suit (with matching sunglasses) but also a rainbow-colored, cloud-printed suit to close out the festival. At last Thursday’s NBA Draft, fresh-faced first round picks Jonathan Kuminga, Evan Mobley and Alperen Sengun pulled out suits in pumpkin, teal and emerald, respectively.</td>

The Mesa, Ariz., medical assistant recalled dreading the moment when she would have to tell her 7-year-old daughter, who was waiting for a sibling.<br />“Mommy is not having a baby,” Ms. Gould said she told her.<br />Like those of other patients slated as potential witnesses in the criminal trial of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, Ms. Gould’s test was wrong. Prosecutors have accused Ms. Holmes of defrauding patients and investors by falsely claiming her invention could accurately perform lab tests on just a few drops of blood.<br />The repeatedly delayed trial—postponed once because Ms. Holmes was due to have a baby herself—is expected to be one of the most widely watched corporate-fraud cases in years. Scheduled to begin with jury selection on Aug. 31 in San Jose, Calif., the trial features a star-studded list of potential witnesses, including ex-Theranos directors Henry Kissinger and Jim Mattis; ex-Theranos lawyer David Boies; and high-profile investors, including Riley Bechtel, the former chairman of Bechtel Corp., and Rupert Murdoch, chairman of Fox Corp. and executive chairman of News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal.</td>

      <td>Facing a now-inevitable Delta-variant surge in the spread of Covid-19, Americans stand divided, not united.<br />Some 100 million adults who are eligible to be vaccinated haven’t been, government leaders say, and getting them to decide to get a stick is the key to changing current, troubling trend lines. Yet many of them still refuse to believe in the need for vaccination, and don’t trust the political messengers pleading with them to change their minds. Vaccine mandates are about to replace mask mandates as a new battle line.<br />It’s hard to escape the feeling that America is battling two diseases: Covid-19 and mistrust.<br />In the face of the pandemic’s polarizing politics, the two forces holding the best hope for breaking through this roadblock may be the private sector—the business community in particular—and the day-to-day conversations Americans have with those they most trust. The power these forces display in the next couple of weeks will be key in determining how hard and long this new phase of the pandemic proves to be.<br />There was a time, 16 months ago, when it was possible to think the coronavirus might pull the country together, politically and socially, in a united response. That simply has never happened. Misinformation about the severity of crisis followed by pitched battles over masks, economic shutdowns and school openings have turned Covid-19 into a political football.</td>

      <td>Low vaccination rates in emerging markets are a drag for the world’s second-largest brewer</td>
      <td>A big business in developing countries is normally a reason to buy  Heineken ’s  shares. For now, though, slow vaccination rollouts have taken the fizz out of some of the world’s most promising beer markets.<br />The second-largest brewer globally after  Anheuser-Busch InBev  said Monday that sales increased 14% in the six months through June, compared with the same period of last year. Revenue is still more than one-tenth below where it was in the first half of 2019.<br />One of the brewer’s profit drivers is making a comeback: Bars and restaurants are reopening in Europe, where Heineken sells a third of its total beer volumes. Operating profit in the region surged 360% in the half compared with the same period last year. However, it hasn’t returned to precrisis levels. Demand is still healthiest in supermarkets, where Heineken’s sales are less profitable than those made in bars.<br />A sluggish recovery in developing countries, which accounted for 54% of the company’s operating profits before the pandemic, is another reason why management doesn’t expect margins to recover fully this year. Some emerging markets are battling a fresh wave of Covid-19 infections. The company’s breweries are currently closed in Malaysia and parts of Vietnam are back under lockdown. In normal times, Asian beer markets are among Heineken’s fastest-growing and most lucrative.<br />Low vaccination rates mean demand may remain volatile for the rest of the year. Just 5.9% of Vietnam’s population has been inoculated compared with 57% in the U.S., based on numbers from Our World in Data. Sluggish growth in emerging markets will make the job of managing inflation that bit harder. The company’s revenues per hectoliter increased 5.5% in the first half, partly a reflection of price increases to offset higher input costs. This pressure will increase as hedges for commodities like barley roll off in the coming months.</td>

      <td>New bills passed in New York City could curb some appeal of companies like Grubhub, DoorDash and Uber Eats</td>
      <td>The New York City Council has long had a bone to pick with food delivery platform Grubhub. During the pandemic, that animus seems to extend to reach the sector more broadly as market share has leveled. Home to about 10% of the U.S. market, and a possible harbinger of local measures elsewhere, the city’s attitude matters a great deal.<br />The conflict heated up last week. On Thursday, the council said it passed five bills meant to shift some of the balance of power away from food delivery platforms toward “struggling mom and pop shops.” The bills include some straightforward legislation like providing a restaurants’ direct telephone number to eaters and prohibiting platforms from charging restaurants for phone orders that don’t result in transactions.<br />But they also include more controversial and likely more consequential rules. One, if put into effect as anticipated, would extend temporary caps placed on the commissions food-delivery platforms can charge restaurants at least until mid-February, 2022. Beyond what was decided last week, the city council says it is also scheduled to review a permanent commission cap bill this month.<br />Long-term caps sound ominous for food delivery companies, but the true extent of their effects isn’t fully known. U.S. market leader  DoorDash ,  for example, has reported profits on the basis of adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization for the last four quarters—pretty much the entirety of the pandemic.<br />At the same time, the company said in an April blog post that commission caps have caused a “tangible impact” to its business in terms of lessening demand as prices paid by customers have risen to recoup lost dollars.</td>

Mr. Trump eased that to 40 mpg, or about 29 mpg on a real-world basis.<br />President Biden has pushed for stronger regulations on auto emissions as part of his campaign to cut greenhouse-gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. Earlier this year, he moved to restore California’s ability to set its own standards that exceeded those set by the federal government, a power that was eliminated by Trump in November 2019.<br />The new standards for fuel-efficiency standards and tailpipe emissions will be released by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department and are expected to apply to vehicles through the 2026 model year. Officials at both agencies declined to discuss their pending proposals.</td>

The calculations and recalculations of risk are leaving many stressed, upset or simply in limbo.<br />New and at times confusing guidance from health officials and employers on wearing masks indoors, and questions about whether vaccines will be required or not, have workers grappling with what to expect at work, or even whether to come in.<br />Mr. Wingelaar had anticipated working at the office without having to wear a mask, but now he says he might have to consider one.

      <td>WASHINGTON—The U.S. will expand eligibility for Afghans seeking admission to the U.S. as refugees, the State Department said, citing increasing levels of Taliban violence amid the U.S. troop withdrawal.<br />Afghans who worked as employees of U.S. government contractors, for U.S.-funded programs, or U.S.-based media or nongovernmental organizations will be eligible for a priority designation to apply to a U.S. refugee program for the opportunity to permanently resettle in the U.S., the State Department said Monday. Their spouses and children will also be eligible.<br />“The U.S. objective remains a peaceful, secure Afghanistan,” the department said.<br />The new designation will enable thousands of Afghans who previously didn’t meet the criteria for an existing refugee program to apply for refugee status. The existing Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program established in 2009 only considered Afghans that worked directly for the U.S. government.<br />The decision comes as the Biden administration has come under significant bipartisan pressure to do more to help Afghans that helped the U.S. during the war.</td>

Both want him on charges of laundering proceeds from a U.S. renewable-energy tax credit fraud, and where he winds up could affect already strained relations between the U.S. and a NATO ally.<br />Sezgin Baran Korkmaz was arrested in Austria in June at the request of the U.S. Department of Justice, which accuses him of laundering more than $133 million in tax fraud proceeds through a network of businesses he controls in Turkey. Prosecutors in Turkey want him in connection with the same alleged scheme, and have launched extradition proceedings against him in an Austrian court, which ordered him to be held until Sept. 22.<br />Mr. Korkmaz’s prosecution in a U.S. courtroom, and the allegations of corruption among the Turkish government that could spill out, would hinder Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s efforts to repair his government’s reputation overseas, according to opposition lawmakers in Ankara and analysts in the U.S. and Turkey.<br />Mr. Erdogan is already contending with a struggling economy, slipping poll numbers, and corruption allegations against senior government officials. The Turkish government is also battling to repair an international image damaged by erratic economic policies and a domestic political clampdown.<br />An extradition fight could also hurt ties between the Turkish and U.S. governments, which are already strained over human rights, Turkey’s purchase of a Russian air-defense system, clashing interests in the conflict in Syria, and President Biden’s decision in April to recognize the Armenian genocide.</td>

They will offer the first detailed look at the population and racial makeup of thousands of counties and cities, as well as tribal areas, neighborhoods, school districts and smaller areas that will be used to redraw congressional, legislative and local districts to balance their populations.<br />The bureau will adjust most of those statistics to prevent someone from recombining them in a way that would disclose information about an individual respondent. Testing by the bureau shows that improvements in data science, computing power and commercial databases make that feasible.<br />Last week the bureau’s acting director said the plan was a necessary update of older methods to protect confidentiality. Ron Jarmin said the agency searched for alternatives before settling on differential privacy, a systematic approach to add statistical noise to data, something it has done in some fashion for years.<br />“I’m pretty confident that it’s going to meet users’ expectations,” Mr. Jarmin said at a panel during an online conference of government data users. “We have to deal with the technology as it is and as it evolves.”</td>

      <td>An exhibition at the New Bedford Whaling Museum examines the visionary artist’s work and traces his influence on Jackson Pollock and others.</td>
      <td>New Bedford, Mass.<br />First, the obvious question: Why is “A Wild Note of Longing: Albert Pinkham Ryder and a Century of American Art,” the first major survey of the enigmatic painter’s work in more than 30 years, at the New Bedford Whaling Museum? Because in 1847 Ryder was born in New Bedford, then one of the wealthiest whaling ports in New England, and lived there until he moved with his family to New York in 1867 or 1868. (Except for trips to Europe and North Africa, he never left New York after that, dying there in 1917.)<br />“A Wild Note of Longing”—the title comes from a poem by Ryder—was organized by Christina Connett Brophy, chief curator of the museum at the time, and the distinguished historians of American art Elizabeth Broun and William C. Agee. They present Ryder as prophetic visionary, pioneering modernist, and influential original who, Ms. Brophy writes, was “at the center of a cultural shift . . . to a powerful and uniquely American voice.” These claims are supported by an impressive mini-retrospective of significant paintings and an account of his still vital legacy. We walk past immense, high-flown cetacean skeletons, down a corridor, to galleries with dark wainscoting, exchanging the brutal world of “Moby-Dick”—published when Ryder was 3 years old—for a fantastic realm of lush pigment and supercharged images. The downside? Less than ideal lighting on admittedly hard-to-light and hard-to-see works, most of them under glass and hung too high.<br />Ryder’s years by the sea may have been formative, but his education and life as a painter were urban. He studied at New York’s National Academy of Design and exhibited regularly in the city from 1873 on, attracting critical acclaim and devoted collectors, and gaining a reputation as an eccentric iconoclast. Yet Ryder’s most powerful, celebrated works, such as the exhibition’s dazzlers “Flying Dutchman” (completed by 1887) and “Jonah” \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(c. 1885-95), are eerily lighted, swirling, all-over equivalents for roiling mid-ocean, with terrifying waves transubstantiated into scrolling patterns of coruscated pigment across the surface. Next stop, Jackson Pollock, who, in fact, called Ryder the only American master who interested him.<br />Interestingly, many of the exhibited works are landlocked. Witness “Landscape” (c. 1870) and related paintings, such as “Weir’s Orchard” (c. 1885-90), typically small, minimally indicated scenes, some bathed in golden light, some with cool skies and dark foliage that teeters between animation and abstraction. The graphic “Pastoral Study” (1897) sets confrontational cattle against a clearly defined, luminous landscape with a distant tiny windmill that pulls us deep into fictive space until the fact of dense paint returns us to the surface.</td>

      <td><br />Whether you’re a diehard Olympics fan or couldn’t care less about the epically scaled sporting event, there’s no escaping the deluge of athletic imagery that floods every TV screen, Twitter feed and news site during—and after—those 16 days of superhuman competition. This summer, the Tokyo-based Games, which begin July 23 after being delayed a year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, are more anticipated than ever. To get you in the spirit, The Wall Street Journal’s Arts in Review team has compiled a list of artworks that celebrate sports and sportsmanship, from the champion athlete’s rare moment of repose to the spectator’s visceral and consuming sense of awe.<br /><br />“Boxer at Rest,” 350-50 B.C.<br />As much as the Olympics are about celebrating strength and stamina, one of the more common experiences among participants is pain, as “Boxer at Rest’’ reminds us. The ancient Greek bronze statue was an anomaly for its time, not because of its highly realistic style, which mirrored that of other sculptures made during the Hellenistic period, but because of the moment it depicted—that is, one of vulnerability and exhaustion. “The more one examines that face, the more striking its realism becomes,” writes critic James Gardner. “Surely it is distorted, but its distortions are those of pugilism rather than of art: the flattened nose that appears to have been broken more than once; the half-shut eyes and battered ears; the swollen, parted lips through which the boxer strains to draw breath. Cast in the lost wax technique, the bronze surface has been inlaid at points with traces of copper alloy to describe scar tissue and traces of blood.” In an era and culture dominated by idealized renderings of triumphant, godlike subjects, the Boxer offered a more down-to-earth portrayal of the athletic experience.</td>

But regulations in most countries don’t address the “potential (possibly global) systemic impact of big-tech operations and of possible spillover effects to the financial sector and across all of the activities that big techs perform,” according to the report. Central banks should study the need for “specific safeguards” for big techs, the paper said.<br />Financial technology firms have grown in tremendous scale in recent years and have become important players in areas traditionally handled by banks, including processing payments through the financial system and providing credit to consumers and businesses.<br />Payments company Square Inc. on Sunday announced its biggest deal ever to acquire  Afterpay Ltd.  in an all-stock deal worth around $29 billion.

Climate researchers have argued to political leaders that Chinese-backed coal plants or projects abroad could get shut down or canceled before investment costs or financing are recovered, and could expose lenders to reputational risks, people familiar with the matter said.<br />The chief economist at state-backed Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., or ICBC, told an international forum in May that the lender is crafting a road map for phasing out coal finance entirely.

In last year’s pandemic-driven, real-world stress test of the banking system, U.S. lenders emerged in solid financial shape, with stronger capital than before, he has said.<br />“Strong capital requirements are essential for banks, particularly for the largest banks,” Mr. Powell told reporters Wednesday, at the conclusion of a two-day Fed policy meeting.<br />Some progressive Democrats say Mr. Powell’s Fed hasn’t been tough enough on large financial firms, arguing that the central bank’s tweaks to rules adopted after the 2008-09 financial crisis significantly softened the impact of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, designed to ward off another financial crisis. Were it not for trillions in fiscal relief from Congress and an array of Fed backstops to credit markets, the banks might have gotten into trouble during the pandemic last year, the argument goes.</td>

      <td>Leaders in Portland, Ore., are looking to combat the city’s rising homicide rate by resurrecting a police unit focused on gun violence. But after a year of growing tension within the department, they can’t find enough officers to join.<br />Since 14 job openings were announced in May, only four police personnel have applied to work with the new version of Portland’s Gun Violence Reduction Team, which was shut down last year amid long-running protests seeking racial justice and an overhaul of police practices. None have yet been assigned.<br />Portland officers say such positions, once considered prestigious, are now less desirable, given the increased scrutiny that accompanies them. The new unit has its own citizen-advisory board, instituted after the old unit was criticized by city leaders for racial profiling. A job description says qualifications include the ability to fight systemic racism.<br />“They’re demonizing and vilifying you, and then they want to put you in a unit where you’re under an even bigger microscope,” said Daryl Turner, head of the union that represents Portland’s officers.<br />Portland police have coped with frequent late-night street violence in the past year, as well as criticism from politicians and activists on the right and left.</td>

In May, it had climbed as high as minus 0.108%, according to  Tradeweb .  Bond yields fall as prices rise.<br />The move partly mirrors the action in the U.S. bond market, where the yield on 10-year Treasurys eased to 1.234% Monday from a peak of 1.749% at the end of March.<br />In Europe, investors’ appetite for sovereign debt has picked up as the outlook for the region has dimmed. The spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus is prompting worries that governments could broaden restrictions and curtail social activity and travel. Europe has also long struggled to kick-start inflation, prompting some money managers to bet that the European Central Bank will continue to buy bonds and keep interest rates low even after other major central banks scale back easy-money policies.<br />“If we get additional easing out of the ECB, then it should be supportive for European bonds,” said Iain Stealey, chief investment officer for fixed income at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “It’s very different to other central banks around the world—such as in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the U.K.—where inflation is expected to pick up and they are talking about the need to normalize.”</td>

But lawmakers took much of the weekend to complete the text of the bill, finishing the final text Sunday night. Completion of the text will allow lawmakers to begin the amendment process and move to final passage in the coming days.<br />“My hope is we’ll finish the bill by the end of the week,” Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine), one of the 10 senators who negotiated the core of the agreement with the White House, said on CNN’s “State of the Union.<br />Mr. Schumer said in floor remarks Sunday night that the bill should move through the chamber quickly.  “Given how bipartisan the bill is, and how much work has already been put in to get the details right, I believe the Senate can quickly process relevant amendments and pass this bill in a matter of days,” he said.<br />The text of the bill will translate into law the agreement lawmakers struck days ago, which provides $110 billion to bridges and roads, $39 billion to public transit, and $65 billion for expanding access to broadband, among other investments beyond currently projected spending. Repurposed federal funds, money recouped from delaying a Trump-era Medicare rebate rule, and a mix of accounting maneuvers will cover the cost of legislation.</td>

      <td>SYDNEY— Square Inc.  has agreed to an all-stock deal valued at around $29 billion to acquire Australia’s  Afterpay Ltd. , an installment-payment company that positions its service as a cheaper and more responsible alternative to a credit card.<br />Square said it plans to integrate Afterpay into its Seller and Cash App business units, which would allow more retailers to offer so-called buy now, pay later services at checkout.<br />Afterpay’s technology allows users to pay for goods in four interest-free installments, while receiving the goods immediately. Customers pay a fee only if they miss an automated payment, a transgression that also locks their account until the balance is repaid. Afterpay says this limits bad debts, particularly in a downturn when job security is shaky and household finances are stretched.<br />Most of Afterpay’s revenue comes from retail merchants, which pay a percentage of the value of each order placed by customers, plus a fixed fee. The company is expanding across the U.S. through deals with retailers including Anthropologie and Free People.<br />“Square and Afterpay have a shared purpose,” said Jack Dorsey, Square’s chief executive. “We built our business to make the financial system more fair, accessible, and inclusive, and Afterpay has built a trusted brand aligned with those principles.”</td>

      <td>California Gov. Gavin Newsom won election in 2018 by 24 points amid an anti-Trump wave. Democrats control every statewide office and a supermajority in the Legislature. But voter frustration with progressive misrule is mounting, and a new poll finds that Mr. Newsom is vulnerable in a Sept. 14 recall election.<br />The Berkeley IGS poll shows 47% of likely voters supporting his ouster. Under California recall rules, voters are first asked whether to remove an elected official. Then they vote separately on a replacement. If a majority votes to boot Mr. Newsom, the candidate with the most votes on the second question becomes Governor.<br />It’s hard to predict the recall turnout given its timing and because it will be conducted by mail-in ballots. The latter should help Mr. Newsom since support for his recall is less (36%) among all registered voters. But it’s not a good sign that his approval rating among all registered voters has fallen 14 points since last September to 50%.<br />Mr. Newsom is notably suffering from a lack of enthusiasm among key groups. Forty-seven percent of likely voters ages 18 and 39 support his removal, as do half of 40- to 64-year-olds and Asians. Likely voters in every region of the state but San Francisco, Los Angeles and the Central Coast want him out.<br />The recall is in part a referendum on the Governor’s excessive and destructive Covid lockdowns. California boasts the third highest unemployment rate in the country (7.7%). Last fall he was caught violating his own Covid rules with friends at the ritzy French Laundry restaurant in Napa Valley. Weeks later he shut down businesses, including outdoor dining.</td>

Never mind. Democrats are in a panic because the federal ban on landlords evicting tenants who haven’t paid rent in 16 months expired on Saturday.<br />The eviction moratorium was perhaps justifiable amid the early lockdowns that threw millions out of work, but it’s now a cautionary tale of how bad policies distort behavior and are difficult to end. The original Cares Act moratorium that only applied to federally subsidized housing expired last July, but the Trump Centers for Disease Control and Prevention imposed its version in September. The moratorium applied to all rental housing and tenants who earned less than $99,000 ($198,000 for couples) who claimed they lost income because of the pandemic. Landlords who evicted non-paying tenants could go to jail.<br />Congress extended the ban in December for a month, but then the Biden Administration extended it three times through Saturday despite rulings from several judges that the CDC had exceeded its authority. Last month Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the liberals in maintaining a stay on a lower-court injunction reversing the ban.<br />Justice Kavanaugh wrote that he agreed the CDC acted unlawfully but allowed the moratorium to continue so rental assistance appropriated by Congress could have more time to be distributed. But he said a “clear and specific congressional authorization (via new legislation) would be necessary for the CDC to extend the moratorium past July 31.”<br />Cue the political panic. On Thursday, two days before July 31, the White House issued a statement essentially blaming the Supreme Court for the moratorium’s end and urged Congress to extend it. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared a five-alarm fire, but her attempt to rush an extension through the House failed. Too many Democrats balked.</td>

But being “bipartisan” is hardly reassuring. The infrastructure bill is being written by a handful of Senators, though you can be sure lobbyists are all over the details if not in the room.<br />On the outside are Americans who want to see for themselves the fine print on permitting reform, union-wage rules, how the bill is paid for, or language that favors political constituencies. Bipartisan bills often contain some of the worst special-interest excesses.<br />Mr. Schumer wants to rush the bill through so he can move on to Bernie Sanders’s $3.5 trillion budget resolution that he will then sprint through on a party-line vote. He wants to pass both before the Senate’s August recess.<br />Amendments will often be offered and voted on while the nation sleeps to meet this artificial deadline that is convenient for the political class but not for informing the public. Both parties operate this way now. But it isn’t the right way to run a democracy, and no wonder Americans hold Congress in such low regard.</td>

The tanker Mercer Street is managed by a London-based company owned by an Israeli billionaire. Israel fingered Iran for the attack, and Iran denied it. On Sunday the U.S. and U.K. joined Israel in holding Iran responsible.<br />“Upon review of the available information, we are confident that Iran conducted this attack, which killed two innocent people, using one-way explosive UAVs, a lethal capability it is increasingly employing throughout the region,” said Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a statement. He said the U.S. is coordinating with allies on a response.<br />Here’s an idea: Stop negotiating with Iran on a nuclear deal that would reward the regime by lifting sanctions and handing it cash and investment to finance new UAV and other attacks throughout the region and beyond.<br />In recent weeks Iran has plotted to kill an Iranian-born U.S. citizen in New York City, encouraged its proxies to attack U.S. bases in Iraq, and accelerated its violations of the 2015 nuclear accord. A new hardline President is taking power in Tehran and has said a renewed deal can contain no limits on Iran’s regional behavior. Instead of making more concessions, Mr. Biden should walk away and step up the sanctions.</td>

      <td>Though few have noticed, the central bank is already slowing the growth of the money supply.</td>
      <td>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last month told the House Banking Committee “it would be a mistake” to tighten monetary policy “at a time when virtually all forecasters” believe that inflation “will come down” on its own. His message couldn’t have been clearer: Mr. Powell isn’t in a hurry to start paring the Fed’s monthly purchases of $120 billion in Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, and the Fed plans to continue monetary easing into 2022.<br />In monetary policy, as in all else, actions speak louder than words. The Fed has expanded its reverse-repo borrowing to an unprecedented $1.26 trillion at the end of June from $272 billion in April, pulling almost a trillion dollars of liquidity out of the financial system. Reverse-repo borrowing has reduced bank reserves, even as the Fed has continued to buy Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities.<br />Not surprisingly, money supply growth is starting to moderate. The growth of the M2 money stock fell from around 25% in 2020 to around 10% on an annualized basis in the first six months of 2021. It was less than 4% in the last quarter. Remarkably in an economy awash in money, Fed action to reduce liquidity by $1 trillion in three months has thus far gone largely unnoticed, but this stealth action represents a dramatic change in monetary policy. The magnitude of the explosion in reverse-repo borrowing is roughly the equivalent of the impact of selling rather than buying $120 billion of securities to the public a month for more than eight months.<br />If all this seems confusing, remember: This isn’t your father’s Fed. The central bank has bought (or offset by buying similar-maturity mortgage-backed securities) 76.4% of all the federal debt issued during the pandemic, almost nine times the share of federal debt purchased by the Fed during World War II. The Fed now holds 33.6% of all publicly held federal debt, roughly the same percentage of the debt held by all other American investors combined. The Fed also holds 35% of all federally insured mortgage-backed securities.<br />The commercial banking system has been profoundly transformed as the Fed balance sheet has exploded. By paying interest on reserves, the Fed has made reserves an interest-bearing asset for the banking system and a liability of the Fed, allowing the Fed to borrow from banks to acquire securities without expanding the money supply. The private banking system now holds more interest-bearing reserves than it has outstanding commercial and industrial loans. Remarkably, the Fed is now borrowing more money from the private banking system than all private commercial borrowers combined.</td>

      <td>The one success of the Arab Spring may not survive its president’s apparent power grab.</td>
      <td>Is the only success story of the Arab Spring reaching an authoritarian end? The series of uprisings that took place across the Middle East failed spectacularly—except in Tunisia, where it had all begun in December 2010, when a destitute street vendor operating without a permit set himself on fire after government bureaucrats confiscated the contents of his produce stand. While its neighbors flamed out, Tunisia made a successful if uneasy transition to democracy. A decade later, the democratically elected president of Tunisia, Kais Saied, has effectively torched his nation’s democratic project.<br />On July 25 Mr. Saied invoked Article 80 of the Tunisian Constitution, which transfers near-absolute power to the president if the country is in “imminent danger.” Mr. Saied dismissed Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi, a political rival backed by Ennahda, a moderate Islamist party, the largest in Parliament. The president then announced he would appoint a new government, “freeze” all parliamentary activity for 30 days, and extend the suspension if necessary “until the situation settles down.” In the following 24 hours, Mr. Saied followed the typical authoritarian playbook: Military troops surrounded the Parliament building to block legislators from meeting; draconian measures prohibiting public assembly of more than three people were enacted; media outlets were shuttered. The president warned that the armed forces will respond to violence “with bullets.”<br />Tunisians greeted the president’s actions with jubilance, their reaction reminiscent of Egyptians who in 2013 cheered their army, led by now-President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, when it removed from power the democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood government of President Mohamed Morsi. Like their Egyptian counterparts, Tunisians will soon find out that their future bodes ill under the authoritarianism of another regional strongman.<br />While there’s a tendency to view this as a regional phenomenon—the latest twinge in a lingering Arab Spring hangover—what is happening in Tunisia is representative of a larger global phenomenon. The populists who ascended in Hungary, Turkey and India—and the U.S., in 2016—were elected not because voters craved authoritarian rule but because the leaders of the liberal democratic institutions failed to deliver competent governance.<br />Tunisians lost patience with their leaders as they watched nine successive governments in 10 years issue big promises and consistently falter. Complex power-sharing arrangements resulted only in legislative stasis and blame-ducking. Since 2011, half of the Tunisian dinar’s value has vanished; unemployment is currently at about 18% and has been as high as 32% in some regions; corruption is endemic; and the government bungled its response to the Covid pandemic.</td>

My father had fled communist Poland for the U.S., but my grandfather was unable to escape and still lived behind the Iron Curtain. I learned very young that it can be dangerous when governments reach too far.<br />As CEO of YouTube, I grapple every day with issues related to free expression and responsibility. Companies, civil society and governments are facing unprecedented challenges and sorting through complicated questions, determining where to draw the lines on speech in the 21st century. Policy makers around the world are introducing regulatory proposals—some argue that too much content is left up on platforms, while others say too much is taken down. At YouTube, we’re working to protect our community while enabling new and diverse voices to break through. Three principles should guide discussions about the regulation of online speech.<br />First, the open internet has transformed society in incredible ways. The Group of Seven leaders reaffirmed the fundamental value of openness in a recent statement. YouTube makes information available to anyone with an internet connection. People around the world come to YouTube to find information, to learn and to build community. But creating a space that’s open to everyone means that bad actors will sometimes cross the line.<br />YouTube has always had community guidelines that set the rules of the road. We remove content that could cause real harm, such as violent extremism, copyright infringement and dangerous pranks. Some of our decisions are controversial, but we apply our policies equally, regardless of who posts the content or the political viewpoint expressed. At the same time, we embrace the inherent complexity and messiness of the internet. Stripping away everything that’s controversial could silence important voices and ideas.<br />The second principle: Democratic governments must provide companies with clear guidelines about illegal speech. That helps us remove illegal content more quickly and efficiently. These laws must be grounded in international norms as officials balance the right to information with the risk of harm. The rules governing the internet are regularly updated, from copyright to elections and political campaigning. YouTube is willing to work with governments to address these and other issues.</td>

      <td>Who says American ingenuity is dead? No other nation could have invented and sustained anything like our Byzantine student loan system, with its immense cost, dizzying complexity and perverse incentives.<br />Launched with the best of intentions, the system has produced a human and financial catastrophe. Many former students have reasonable debts, but millions have no realistic hope of paying what they owe, proving once again the iron law of credit—that truly massive debts end up in the lap of taxpayers. The whole mess is the subject of two valuable new books.<br />In “The Debt Trap,” Josh Mitchell offers a devastating account of the ways in which government, business, academia and naive citizens joined forces to produce the nation’s $1.6 trillion student loan crisis. The story he tells is so infuriating that it could induce apoplexy in a Zen monk. Yet it is also a characteristically American story, in which democratic ideals, political expedience, concerns over national security, naked greed and tender optimism have blighted the lives of millions.<br />Government-supported student loans go back to the 1950s, when they began in a climate of concern (not to say paranoia) about communism, against which advanced schooling, particularly of a technical nature, was considered a potent weapon. The GI Bill had demonstrated the potential for democratizing higher education, but almost everyone was wary of direct subventions to campuses for fear of federal control. Many legislators, moreover, were children of the Depression who believed that students wouldn’t take college seriously if they didn’t pay their way. From the start, the idea was to fund students (rather than schools) via loans and work-study jobs.<br />At first limited to the needy, federally backed student loans were eventually made available to all. Loan limits climbed ever upward, and Uncle Sam fatefully stopped paying the interest for much of this lending while borrowers were in school. Callow youths, sold on the value of a sheepskin, borrowed small fortunes to attend third-rate campuses or, worse, for-profit chains designed to exploit the easy money.

The foundation has sponsored fellowships for dozens of journalists from Muslim-majority countries to work at news organizations in the U.S. One stop for them was dinner at the Pearls’ home in Los Angeles. The foundation also has sponsored concerts and lectures.<br />Ms. Pearl died July 20 at her home in the Encino section of Los Angeles. She was 85 and had been under treatment for lung ailments.<br />Her son’s death nearly two decades ago came as an unimaginable shock. He traveled to Pakistan in January 2002 to report on militant networks there as The Wall Street Journal tried to explain the roots of terrorism. The 38-year-old Mr. Pearl was kidnapped and beheaded less than two weeks later. His last recorded words included: “My father is Jewish, my mother is Jewish, I am Jewish.”<br />The execution was videotaped and released on the internet. At the time, his wife, Mariane Pearl, was pregnant with their only child, Adam.</td>

For a movie like “Jungle Cruise,” which cost more than $200 million to make, that is certainly the case.<br />Releases that welcomed audiences back to auditoriums—“A Quiet Place Part II,” “F9: The Fast Saga” and “Black Widow”—opened with grosses that trended upward, with “Black Widow” hitting $80 million in its opening weekend in early July. But several of those hits sputtered in subsequent weeks, and that upward trend is nowhere to be found with newer big-budget movies such as “Snake Eyes.” The timing doesn’t bode well, since the highly contagious Delta variant of Covid-19 could send the industry into another tailspin of uncertainty and force studios to shuffle release dates once again.<br />The weekend’s other new releases carried a much smaller budget than “Jungle Cruise” but still failed to break out in a major way.</td>

      <td>The month they mock as lazy gave us color TV sports, the Berlin Wall and the web.</td>
      <td>It’s August—the hazy, lazy days of summer. People are either at their vacation homes or wishing they were at Burning Man, virtual again this year. The future’s on hold, so you might as well head to the ballpark or the beach, shut your brain down and read Lizzy Dent’s novel “The Summer Job.” Nothing ever happens in August. Except . . .<br />Surprise! On Aug. 11, 1951, New York’s WCBS-TV broadcast the first baseball game in color, a double-header from Brooklyn’s Ebbets Field. The surprise was that television could do color at all—maybe 100 color sets existed at the time. Yes, “The Wizard of Oz” stunned theatergoers with color in August 1939. But television? Around 20% of U.S. homes had black-and-white TVs, often to watch Rocky Marciano’s almost monthly boxing matches, which my dad called the Bum of the Month club. By 1960 almost 90% of homes had sets. As broadcasts in color ramped during the ’60s, color-TV sales boomed. Someone paying attention 70 years ago would have seen the future.<br />Surprise! On Aug. 13, 1961, the world woke up to 32,000 troops in the Soviet sector of Berlin installing 97 miles of barbed wire and eventually building concrete fences—not to keep people out, but to keep anyone from leaving. The Berlin Wall stood for 28 years, as the icy Cold War proved that capitalism in the West, especially West Germany, completely outdistanced the stagnant communist Five Year Plans and neighbor turning in neighbor via East Germany’s Stasi secret police. The only question is why it took so long to implode.<br />Surprise! On Aug. 15, 1971, President Nixon ended the international gold standard set up at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference. Most didn’t see that coming. After years of funding Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society and the never-ending Vietnam War, the U.S. couldn’t afford both guns and butter as other countries began demanding physical gold instead of printed dollars for trade imbalances. Subsequent inflation was definitely not “transitory.” Oil embargoes and economic “malaise” followed. Real assets soared, stocks flatlined. This was broken only when President Reagan had Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker’s back as he slew inflation with punishing interest-rate hikes.<br />Surprise! On Aug. 5, 1981, Reagan fired more than 11,000 striking air-traffic controllers, members of the Patco union. Union membership as a percentage of the U.S. workforce peaked in 1945, but the decline slowed in the 1960s and 1970s. It’s been steadily falling since Reagan’s action. That and capital-gains tax cuts, encouraging capital formation, set up U.S. companies for rapid and profitable growth. A massive bull market began in 1982—Aug. 13 actually—with the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 777. We’ve rarely looked back.</td>

      <td>Social media has made the pathologies of fame ubiquitous.</td>
      <td>Simone Biles’s withdrawal from the Olympics prompted a lot of talk about the widespread deterioration of young Americans’ mental health. At first glance a star athlete’s experience may seem worlds apart from that of an ordinary teenager or young adult. But in the age of social media, the cultural emphasis on fame and validation is widespread.<br />A 2019 survey for the Lego Group found that “YouTuber” is the most common career aspiration for 8- to 12-year-olds, nearly three times as popular as “astronaut.” Social media leaves teens highly vulnerable to external influence and especially sensitive to harsh criticism and bullying. Websites like  Twitter  and Instagram are breeding grounds for brutal, constant and omnipresent bullying and judgment. Social media also encourages unrealistic standards of what it means to be “beautiful” or “cool” and to have a “good life,” all of which contributes to anxiety, self-consciousness and harsh self-criticism.<br />Such shallow pursuits have always been a part of adolescence, but they were a brief developmental phase on the way to self-acceptance and emotional security. Now social media prolongs this period of self-involvement, self-consciousness and insecurity, and teens and young adults often get stuck in a negative feedback loop. The superficial and the approval of others becomes an obsession for adolescents.<br />Teens are especially vulnerable to criticism and rejection because the amygdala, the part of the brain that reacts to threat or fear, becomes very active during adolescence, while the prefrontal cortex, which regulates the reactions of the threat-sensing amygdala, and promotes the ability to see things or in perspective, lags behind in development. This combination of hypersensitivity and underdeveloped emotional regulation leads to harsh self-consciousness and self-criticism, which can immobilize many teens.<br />If your teen is struggling, Ms. Biles may be a good role model. So may Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, who has been open about his mental-health challenges, which began in adolescence, and who has promoted the destigmatization of mental-health treatment for adolescents and adults. Many young athletes are standing up, saying no to the pressure, and exposing the ugly truth behind the obsession with winning and fame.</td>

      <td>The union representing workers at Chile’s La Escondida copper mine said its members voted to reject the most recent contract offer from the mine’s owner and go on strike, potentially risking disruptions to the supply of a key metal as the world’s economy continues to recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.<br />BHP Group Ltd. -controlled Minera Escondida, located in Chile’s northern Atacama Desert, is the world’s largest copper mine, producing almost 5% of the world’s supply of the metal, which is used to make electrical wiring and motors and in construction, among many other applications.<br />By law, the miners must continue to work during a period of obligatory mediation by the government for a period of up to 10 days, so a strike isn’t a done deal, according to some analysts. Voting to authorize a strike is often seen across industries as a negotiating tactic.<br />“Any significant impact on the market and thus prices will depend on whether there is a walkout in 10 days or not,” said Eleni Joannides, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, a commodities consulting firm, ahead of the vote. Although, “at current prices, Escondida negotiations appear to be built into the market.”<br />Still, when Escondida workers walked off the job in 2017, they didn’t return for 44 days.</td>

Min Aung Hlaing said his State Administration Council is “working as quickly as possible” to prepare for fresh elections after voiding the results of a 2020 vote that dealt a landslide victory to the party of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.<br />“I pledge to hold the multiparty general election without fail,” Mr. Min Aung Hlaing said.<br />Ms. Suu Kyi and other members of her government have been detained since the Feb. 1 coup, which abruptly ended the Southeast Asian nation’s decadelong transition to democracy and threw the country into chaos. The military says the 2020 vote was marred by widespread fraud, a claim disputed by independent election observers.<br />Protests erupted within a week after the putsch and have continued almost daily in the six months since. At least 940 people have been killed and more than 5,400 others have been detained since the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a nonprofit that monitors arrests and fatalities.</td>

      <td>CRT opponents must also wage a ‘war of position.’</td>
      <td>In his synopsis of the core claims of critical race theory (CRT), William Galston identifies the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci as a key influence on the movement (“A Deeper Look at Critical Race Theory,” Politics & Ideas, July 21). Quoting from the foundational CRT thinker Kimberlé Crenshaw, Mr. Galston highlights Gramsci’s attention to “hegemony,” defined as the ideological regime by which dominant social groups present their rule as natural and inevitable. For CRT, such a perspective enables us to see the enduring force of “white supremacy” even after the legal advances toward formal racial equality achieved by the civil-rights movement.<br />Mr. Galston argues that CRT has gone beyond using Gramsci’s ideas as an analytical lens and has put them into practice: “Following Gramsci’s lead, critical race theory has used mainstream concepts such as equality and inclusion to wage a highly effective war of position against liberal ideology.” In other words, CRT has begun to achieve hegemony by transmuting its own assumptions into the common sense that increasingly guides all the major institutions of American society: education, the media, nonprofits and the private sector.<br />What Mr. Galston doesn’t acknowledge is that if CRT has become hegemonic, CRT opponents must also become Gramscian in their methods and aims. No less than their nemeses, they see themselves as engaged in a “war of position” against an ideology that legitimates the rule of a particular class. Andrew Breitbart, the late conservative media entrepreneur, identified this as the right’s task. His dictum “politics is downstream from culture” was explicitly derived from Gramsci. In this sense, one of the most influential Gramscians currently on the scene is Christopher Rufo, whose rhetorical battle against CRT has succeeded in reshaping the ideological battleground.<br />Geoff Shullenberger<br />Senior lecturer, New York University</td>

      <td>Iran’s demand that the 2015 nuclear deal be modified to circumscribe a future U.S. president’s ability to withdraw unilaterally may be a blessing in disguise (“Iran’s Latest Nuclear Demand,” Review & Outlook, July 26). The proposal would amount to a serious modification of the original agreement. As such, it signals a desire by Iran not simply to return to “mutual compliance” with the accord, but to renegotiate it.<br />While the Biden administration should not—and, constitutionally, likely cannot—agree to Tehran’s proposal, it should welcome the chance to renegotiate rather than simply re-enter the nuclear deal. President Biden has called for a “stronger, longer” agreement, making the need to replace the deal a matter of bipartisan consensus. Concluding such an agreement, or even getting Iran to the table to discuss it, won’t be easy. But re-entering the original deal first and relinquishing the economic leverage provided by sanctions seem likely to make it even harder.<br />Iran’s reluctance to accept Mr. Biden’s offer of a return to mutual compliance with the 2015 deal offers an opportunity to move to a new phase of diplomacy. The U.S. should respond to Iran’s demands for alterations to the deal by putting on the table its own ideas for strengthening the agreement, moving directly to negotiation of the stronger, longer accord that successive U.S. administrations have desired.<br />Michael Singh<br />Managing director, Washington Institute for Near East Policy</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Investors barely reacted last week when Federal Reserve officials signaled they could announce plans to start reducing their bond buying later this year. That was a relief for policy makers eager to avoid a repeat of the market turmoil that erupted in 2013 when the Fed made a similar announcement.<br />The Fed’s next test will come when it outlines a concrete plan for when and how it will scale back, or taper, the asset purchases.<br />The central bank has been buying $120 billion a month of Treasury and mortgage securities since June 2020, a pace officials say will continue until the economic recovery advances further. By bidding up the price of long-term bonds, the purchases tend to hold down borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, since bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.<br />Some investors worry that yields will jump significantly higher when the Fed stops buying bonds. The Fed’s indication in 2013 that it would eventually wind down an earlier bond-buying program sparked such an episode, dubbed the taper tantrum.<br />But research by economists and Fed staff in recent years has found that tapering need not provoke a tantrum.</td>

      <td>Hedge, mutual and pension funds are investing heavily, leading to higher valuations and more leverage for company founders</td>
      <td>The world’s largest investment funds are descending on Silicon Valley with unprecedented financial force, roiling the once-niche business of technology startup funding and crowding out traditional venture capitalists.<br />Hedge funds, mutual funds, pensions, sovereign-wealth groups and other financial institutions known as nontraditional investors in Silicon Valley have become the powertrain behind record-setting funding rounds and valuations. They were more active in the second quarter than in any previous period, participating in 42% of startup financing deals, and those deals accounted for more than three-quarters of all the invested capital, according to research firm PitchBook Data Inc.<br />These financial institutions have propelled a historic rally in startup financing. Investment in U.S. startups for the first half of the year hit $150 billion, eclipsing full-year funding every year before 2020 and on pace to nearly double last year’s record, according to a report from PitchBook.<br />The large asset firms have massive pools of capital, move quickly and are less likely to ask for board seats or involvement in company decisions, often making them more appealing to founders, according to interviews with investors and startup executives. The result has been a dizzying pace of deal making.<br />“It’s like speed dating but more extreme,” said Peter Fishman, a longtime Silicon Valley tech professional who last year co-founded data-automation startup Mozart Data Inc.</td>

Authorities said they had responded to allegations that he repeatedly deceived young women into having sex with him.<br />The detention of Mr. Wu, a Chinese-Canadian singer and actor who is also known as Wu Yifan, was widely celebrated by Chinese internet users and even by Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily, which weighed in on its social-media account saying the more famous someone is, the more self-discipline they should exercise.<br />Before the police announcement, Mr. Wu denied the allegations and said he would willingly go to jail if they were true. A rape conviction in China usually results in between three and 10 years of prison. His lawyer and management company didn’t respond to requests for comment Sunday.</td>

      <td>The tariffs, which largely affect imports from Chinese-owned companies, were imposed in 2018 and are due to expire next year</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Two small U.S. solar companies plan to petition the government to extend tariffs on solar cell and panel imports, reigniting a fight that has split the industry—and one that could force the White House to choose sides.<br />Auxin Solar Inc., a San Jose, Calif., solar panel manufacturer, and Suniva Inc., which owns an idled solar cell factory in Norcross, Ga., plan to ask the U.S. International Trade Commission on Monday to extend the solar tariffs for four years, said Mamun Rashid, Auxin’s chief executive officer.<br />The 18% tariffs were imposed in 2018, and are set to expire next year. They  largely affect imports from Chinese-owned companies. China is the world’s largest producer of solar cells and panels used to generate electricity, although it has moved some of its production to elsewhere in Asia to avoid U.S. tariffs.<br />The companies say extending the tariffs is necessary to “secure America’s solar energy independence” and to “rid the solar supply chain of injurious and unfair trade practices” that hurt American workers, according to a copy of the petition.<br />“It’s a national-security concern,” Mr. Rashid said.</td>

      <td>China’s biggest liquor company, a favorite of international investors, has become a financial lifeline for the underdeveloped southern region where it is based.<br />Kweichow Moutai Co .  has generated billions of dollars for the local government of Guizhou, thanks in large part to the company’s soaring stock price.<br />The company’s high-end versions of baijiu, a potent spirit made by fermenting grains such as sorghum, have become status symbols in China. That has turned the state-backed, Shanghai-listed company into by far the world’s most valuable distiller—worth some $326 billion, according to FactSet.<br />The company’s rise has been a gift for the province of Guizhou, which is Moutai’s majority shareholder. Many of China’s other big state-owned enterprises, including banks, telecoms, airlines and oil companies, are owned directly by the central government, not local authorities.<br />Moutai is a major local taxpayer. Aside from that, much of the support has come through Moutai’s unlisted, state-owned parent. Enriched by Moutai’s runaway success, this group has been able to invest in local infrastructure such as airports, railways and highways. It has also given company shares to another local government entity, which in turn has sold some of these for cash.</td>

      <td>Intel Corp.  aspires to chip-technology supremacy within four years. But for now, it has fallen from the industry’s top spot by one key measure.<br />In the second quarter,  Samsung  Electronics Co. overtook Intel as the world’s top chip maker by revenue. Given divergent outlooks for their core businesses, the positioning is likely to stay that way in the near future, industry analysts say.<br />The South Korean tech company, which specializes in memory chips, racked up 22.74 trillion won, the equivalent of $19.7 billion, in semiconductor revenue during the April-June quarter. Total revenue for Intel, was $19.6 billion—or $18.5 billion after subtracting the contribution of a business unit it has agreed to sell.<br />Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has held the No. 1 sales spot for much of the past three decades, ceding it to Samsung in 2017 and 2018 when memory-chip sales boomed.<br />The ranking is about more than bragging rights: Intel needs financial clout more than ever. Under new Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger, the company is embarking on an ambitious strategy to manufacture cutting-edge chips—one of the business world’s costliest endeavors.</td>

      <td>Jacob Ma wasn’t going to let the fact that his new job kept him at home all day stop him from making new friends.<br />As soon as he joined the software company  Qualtrics  as a consultant in January, the former college resident adviser and inveterate social organizer started brainstorming ways to hang out with his new colleagues. He first put together virtual social events, like online happy hours and scavenger hunts, and, starting in late March, added in-person meetups at safe outdoor venues in the Seattle metro area.<br />“It’s really hard to make friends over Zoom, and it’s definitely easier for me to meet someone in real life and see whether we might want to hang out again outside of work,” says Mr. Ma, 27 years old. Today, he has a couple of colleagues he hangs out with regularly on the weekends and continues to organize events roughly once a month.<br />“Jacob is like a party-planning committee of one,” says his co-worker Britney Shalloway, 29, who moved to Seattle in June and has appreciated these events as a way to get to know her colleagues in a new city.<br />Starting a remote job can be hard, but many people have found new ways to forge work friendships during the pandemic. There’s no longer a proverbial water cooler to generate casual encounters, and some younger workers have never had a physical office at all. But they’ve overcome the awkwardness of the digital chat box to initiate meaningful, if often distanced, friendships. Some online work friends have even found success taking their hangouts offline once the vaccine rollout made socializing and travel easier.</td>

      <td>Laws, procedures to evict tenants in some Southern states are among the most landlord-friendly in U.S.</td>
      <td>A national ban on most residential evictions expired after Saturday, setting the stage for a potentially widespread displacement of low-income renters that looks poised to hit Southern states particularly hard.<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention enacted the eviction ban in September to protect millions of tenants who were unable to pay rent due to financial hardship during the pandemic. The CDC has extended the moratorium three times. The White House said on Wednesday that only the U.S. Congress could extend it again, citing a Supreme Court ruling that a spokeswoman said limited the CDC’s power to renew it. But lawmakers failed to reach an agreement to renew the ban.<br />Renters in Southern states are among the most vulnerable to the ban’s expiration, U.S. Census survey data indicate. Mississippi, South Carolina and Georgia tenants are more likely to carry rent debt than the U.S. average, surveys show. Nationally, about 18% of adult renters live in households that are behind on rent payments.<br />Eviction laws and procedures in some Southern states are also among the most landlord-friendly in the country, which means many tenants could be evicted quickly once the ban lifts.<br />In Mississippi, tenants can lose their eviction case in court and be removed from their home on the same day. In Arkansas, landlords can pursue criminal charges for tenants who don’t pay rent. And in western Tennessee, where a federal judge ruled that the CDC ban was unconstitutional, tenants are already getting evicted for nonpayment.</td>

      <td>Investors are betting the inflationary streak that has sent prices of everything from used cars to lumber soaring will fade in the coming years, a reassuring sign for markets struggling to find direction.<br />Few issues have vexed money managers more this year than inflation. As the global economy has regained its footing, prices for goods and services have risen—in many cases far faster than economists had anticipated. Labor shortages and supply-chain disruptions snarling the global shipping industry have added to inflationary pressures.<br />The trend has worried many investors, since inflation can chip into companies’ profit margins, pressuring share prices. It can also eat away at the purchasing power of government bonds’ fixed returns. In the days ahead, investors will get a look at fresh economic data including factory orders, vehicle sales and the monthly employment report.<br />Yet markets are starting to signal that investors may be growing less fearful.<br />Take the break-even rate. Calculated by measuring the difference in yields between Treasurys and their inflation-protected counterparts, or TIPS, the break-even rate shows how much inflation traders anticipate over a period of time. Since peaking for the year in May, the break-even rates for five-, seven-, and 10-year Treasurys have all fallen—suggesting traders are pricing in a moderation in inflation in coming years.</td>
