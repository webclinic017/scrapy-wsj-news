At Tehran’s insistence, the U.S. delegation won’t have a seat at the table—its members must wait in an antechamber to be briefed by the Europeans. The mullahs have always relished humiliating Americans, particularly those eager to prove their benevolent intentions. These negotiations will yield little, no matter how much money Washington releases or how ardently Biden administration officials describe any follow-on talks as important steps toward a diplomatic solution.<br />The clerical regime’s atomic ambitions will continue to progress rapidly because the U.S. administration has no intention of trying to rescind what President Obama’s nuclear deal granted: the development of high-yield, easily hidden centrifuges, the key to an unstoppable bomb program. The Islamic Republic has displayed an uncanny ability to advance its aspirations and eviscerate American red lines with impunity.</td>

The real risk to the U.S. economy and financial stability is regulators, like Mr. Biden’s nominee for Comptroller of the Currency Saule Omarova, who want to bankrupt fossil-fuel companies.<br />The Fed staff study comes as the Administration ramps up plans to regulate how banks deploy capital in the name of protecting the financial system from climate change. But the authors find that banks are already doing an excellent job of managing risks from extreme weather that climate change will supposedly make worse.</td>

Wade: Then, no woman had ever been elected attorney general of a U.S. state, and none would be for another dozen years. Now, Mississippi’s attorney general is defending the constitutionality of her state’s law banning most abortions after 15 weeks. Earlier this year Lynn Fitch appointed Solicitor General Scott G. Stewart, who on Wednesday will make the state’s case to the Supreme Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.<br />“Everything has changed in the last 50 years,” says Ms. Fitch, 60, a Republican who was elected in 2019, in an interview. “Our laws are much different. The culture is different today than it was 50 years ago. And certainly the workforce and the workplace has changed.” That’s part of the reason the justices should uphold Mississippi’s law, the state argues.</td>

Boeing had insisted after a Lion Air jet tumbled into the Java Sea, in October 2018, that the plane was safe. Less than five months later an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX went down too. In total, 346 people died.<br />An uproar ensued, and the 737 MAX—Boeing’s upgrade to its venerable 737—was grounded while the company worked on a fix. Hearings were held, lawsuits filed, the company’s chief executive was sent packing. Still, once the pandemic hit, the controversy faded. Peter Robison’s “Flying Blind: The 737 MAX Tragedy and the Fall of Boeing” is a disturbing account that will return much-deserved scrutiny both to Boeing and to its regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration.</td>

This is why over half of first-year community-college students in the U.S. take at least one remedial course in reading or math. In the U.S., 43 million adults are illiterate.

Local news is created and consumed differently than national news, and according to a 2019 Knight-Gallup study, more people believe their local news organizations are accomplishing most of the key tasks of informing their communities.

      <td>Regarding “Ganging Up on Moderna” (op-ed, Nov. 17): The National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies are critical partners and funders of basic research that benefits domestic manufacturing, especially in the biomedical sciences. Public-private partnerships have supported many life-changing advancements, but private-sector research dwarfs the federal contribution.<br />A National Association of Manufacturers study finds that biopharmaceutical manufacturers annually invest $83 billion in R&D, all aimed at drug development. By contrast, less than 9% of the NIH’s fiscal 2019 budget of $39 billion—or $3.5 billion—was focused on research directly related to drug development. It is disingenuous for some policy makers to suggest otherwise as they try to justify stripping manufacturers of intellectual property protections.</td>

      <td>A more inclusive vision of French style is in the air, as evidenced by Vogue Paris rebranding as Vogue France. What’s in: forward-thinking designers and women of different backgrounds and sizes. What’s out: the thin, white, rich Parisian stereotype in a trench coat.</td>
      <td>“How to be Parisian Wherever You Are.” “Lessons from Madame Chic: 20 Stylish Secrets I Learned While Living in Paris.” “Parisian Charm School: French Secrets for Cultivating Love, Joy, and That Certain Je Ne Sais Quoi.” “Chic and Slim Toujours.” “Love Parisienne: The French Woman’s Guide to Love and Passion.” These are just a few of the dozens of books published in the 2000s that trafficked in the myth of the Parisian woman (or “girl,” as she is often called). In these books, French women are boiled down to one reductive stereotype: the thin, white, rich Parisian sophisticate in a striped shirt, trench coat and Hermès scarf.<br />That cliché persisted for decades, incarnated by such celebrities as singer Jane Birkin, actor Brigitte Bardot, and model and designer Inès de la Fressange. Although Ms. Birkin is British, Ms. Bardot has lived in the South of France for decades and Ms. de la Fressange is partly of Argentine-Colombian descent, they came to stand for a distinctive brand of Parisian style. But this fairy tale is finally fading. Ms. Bardot, 87, once an icon of elegance, was fined €20,000 this month by a French court for writing in a 2019 open letter that inhabitants of Réunion Island have “savage genes” for their treatment of animals. (A spokesperson for Ms. Bardot declined to comment.) A new generation of diverse celebrities, social media stars and designers is exploding the codes of the Parisian aesthetic. And 101 years after its founding, the Condé Nast magazine Vogue Paris has changed its name to the more inclusive Vogue France under its new head of editorial content Eugénie Trochu.</td>

      <td>New York<br />Polychromed sculpture from Spain and the Spanish New World has long been largely overlooked, even by the Hispanic Society Museum & Library, a little-visited jewel in New York’s Washington Heights. Established in 1904 by the collector and philanthropist Archer M. Huntington (1870-1955), it has been shuttered for almost five years for renovation. “Gilded Figures: Wood and Clay Made Flesh,” a compelling show of 22 painted sculptures from 1500 to 1800 that inaugurates the museum’s gradual reopening, highlights art from its larger, storied collection that often goes unnoticed. Organized by Patrick Lenaghan, curator of prints, photographs and sculpture, and Hélène Fontoira Marzin, head of conservation, it reflects a sea change in critical thinking, and, as many of the works on view are newly acquired, a burgeoning taste for the medium. In a single gallery of these richly decorated and elaborately illusionistic works, so different from unpainted European sculpture, historic polychromed sculpture is enshrined at the very heart of Spanish culture.</td>

      <td>Four books pursue theories of possible origins of the Covid-19 virus—and the question of cover-ups.</td>
      <td>The first outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the disease that would come to be known as Covid-19 occurred during the fall of 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, but the world still doesn’t know the virus’s precise origin. Many scientists believe that the most likely explanation is zoonotic spillover, a process in which the virus jumped to humans through another species in the wild. Historical precedent makes the theory plausible—SARS-CoV-1, the virus that caused the 2002-04 SARS epidemic, seems to have crossed over from civet cats. But direct evidence that something similar happened in the case of Covid-19 has yet to emerge.<br />The alternative to the theory of zoonotic origin is, as science writer Nicholas Wade puts it, “the common-sense perception that a pandemic breaking out in Wuhan might have something to do with a Wuhan lab cooking up novel viruses of maximal danger in unsafe conditions.” In “Where COVID Came From,”  Mr. Wade makes the case that Covid-19’s evolutionary history and anatomy, along with the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s research and safety record, suggests that the virus was modified by humans and escaped the lab.</td>

He did not in the least become what is called ‘anti-intellectual,’ but he began to fear that the commitment to abstract ideas could be far more maleficent than the commitment to the gross materiality of property had ever been. The very stupidity of things has something human about it, something meliorative, something even liberating. Together with the stupidity of the old unthinking virtues it stands against the ultimate and absolute power which the unconditioned idea can develop.”</td>

      <td>T.S. Eliot was not only one of the most important 20th-century poets—he defined what poetry of the era ought to be.</td>
      <td>If fame is the name of your desire, writing about literature is among the least likely ways to find it. From the 17th century until today, only four literary critics, John Dryden (1631-1700), Samuel Johnson (1709-1784), Matthew Arnold (1828-1888) and T.S. Eliot (1888-1965)—five if one includes that one-man Tower of Babel, Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834)—have attained enduring reputations. All five also wrote poetry, but, apart from Eliot, it is doubtful if today any would be remembered for his poetry alone.<br />What these men have in common is that all were, in the old-fashioned phrase, men of letters. T.S. Eliot, who may have been the last of the breed, defined the man of letters as “the writer for whom his writing is primarily an art, who is as much concerned with style as with content; the understanding of whose writings, therefore, depends as much upon appreciation of style as upon comprehension of content.” Literature, for the man of letters, who not only writes about it but practices it by himself writing poetry, fiction or drama, provides wisdom beyond all other wisdoms, surpassing science, social science, history and philosophy, while incorporating them all.</td>

      <td>The repeal of three market-friendly agricultural laws will limit upward mobility for India’s workers.</td>
      <td>For a politician elected for his strong leadership, Narendra Modi is pretty good at abject surrender. Last week he appeared on national television to announce the repeal of three market-friendly farm laws passed by his government last year.<br />“With a true mind and a pure heart, I want to say that perhaps there was some deficiency in our penance because of which we were not able to explain to some of our farmer brothers a truth as clear as the light of an oil lamp,” Mr. Modi said in Hindi. Translation: The laws would have helped farmers, but I’m scrapping them anyway because the government couldn’t convince protesters of their merit.</td>

      <td>To match one of the most fantastic feats of invention in literature, the story of how it came to be.</td>
      <td>In an empire long ago there lived a king who discovered his wife sleeping with a palace slave. Crazed by jealousy he vowed that henceforth he would marry only for the length of a night and each morning his new bride would be killed. After he had carried out his wicked agenda for some time, Scheherazade, the brave daughter of the king’s vizier, demanded that she be the next in line to the royal bedchamber. During the first night she beguiled the time with a fantastic story, breaking off at a moment of high suspense as morning arrived. The king agreed to delay her execution so long as she took up the tale the following night—and the reprieve was extended again, and again, until, after one thousand and one nights, the king saw the error of his ways.<br />That is the premise of what may be the greatest treasury of stories in all of world literature, which have now been newly translated by Yasmine Seale in a gorgeous illustrated volume, edited by Paulo Lemos Horta, entitled “The Annotated Arabian Nights.” On display again is the spectacular panoply of storytelling, from tales of magic and wonder to murder mysteries to instructional fables to sexual burlesques. But also contained in this heaping volume is the history of how the tales coalesced, a story every bit as intricate and engrossing as those that enchanted the mad king.</td>

      <td>The great composer Ludwig van Beethoven arrives in 1830s Boston to premiere a new work based on the Book of Job.</td>
      <td>A few decades before the great cultural migration that drove creative artists to the New World in flight from the Russian Revolution and Hitler, the U.S. hosted two of Europe’s most important composers. Antonín Dvořák directed New York City’s National Conservatory of Music from 1892 to 1895. Gustav Mahler conducted the Metropolitan Opera and New York Philharmonic from 1908 to 1911. Dvořák was a fit for New York; Mahler was not. Dvořák, one learns, was a man at all times marvelously responsive to his environs. Mahler lived profoundly inside his own head.<br />Paul Griffiths has now added a third historic visitor: Ludwig van Beethoven. He arrived in Boston in 1833 at the invitation of the Handel and Haydn Society and composed an English-language oratorio titled “Job,” which received its premiere under the composer’s supervision. Of course, Beethoven died in 1827 and never visited Boston. But he did receive an 1823 invitation from the Handel and Haydn Society to write an oratorio—the catalyst for Mr. Griffiths’s quixotic and original work of historical fiction.</td>

      <td>Research shows that colleagues who work remotely can develop the same levels of trust as those working face-to-face. It just takes longer.</td>
      <td>A year and a half into the pandemic, remote work remains popular, and a recent survey found that 76% of those who work outside of the office want to continue doing so at least part of the time.<br />But remote work also poses challenges, one of the biggest being that many employees report having a harder time building relationships with colleagues when using videoconferencing platforms such as Zoom.</td>
