      <td>Tesla Inc.  Chief Executive Elon Musk said Wednesday that he and his rocket company, SpaceX, hold bitcoin, a cryptocurrency he generally supports despite having concerns about its environmental impacts.<br />Tesla disclosed a $1.5 billion investment in bitcoin in February and soon after began accepting the cryptocurrency as payment for its vehicles. The company quickly reversed course, however, suspending that initiative in May as Mr. Musk expressed worry about the source of the electricity being used to power bitcoin mining.<br />Mr. Musk’s comments about bitcoin have added to price volatility, at times causing sharp swings in the cryptocurrency’s value. Mr. Musk said that with his personal holding in bitcoin, he is financially affected when the price drops.<br />“I might pump, but I don’t dump,” he said on a panel about bitcoin. “I definitely do not believe in getting the price high and selling or anything like that.”<br />The price of bitcoin briefly rose during the panel, but has since fallen, according to CoinDesk.</td>

      <td>AT&T Inc.  said it agreed to sell its Vrio satellite business in Latin America to Argentina’s Grupo Werthein, continuing the Dallas telecom giant’s move away from the television business.<br />The sale covers 10.3 million subscribers across 11 countries in the Western Hemisphere, including Argentina, Chile and Colombia, inherited from AT&T’s purchase of DirecTV. The wireless carrier said the sale will trigger a $4.6 billion accounting charge, which includes $2.1 billion tied to “accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments.”<br />AT&T is slated to report quarterly earnings on Thursday.<br />An AT&T spokesman said the transaction carries an enterprise value of $500 million, which will be paid over the next few years. The companies expect to close the deal in early 2022.<br />Vrio has struggled with challenges unique to its home turf, including foreign-exchange rate swings and economic downturns in key markets including Brazil, where the unit holds a controlling stake in satellite-TV service Sky Brasil. The company previously wrote down its operations in Venezuela, where diplomatic tensions with the U.S. threatened the business.</td>

      <td>On Nord Stream and Chinese hacking, a message of weakness.</td>
      <td>A troubling pattern is emerging in President Biden’s foreign policy: Officials talk tough—then follow up with diplomacy that amounts to little. Two examples this week—on Chinese hacking and Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline—underscore the point.<br />Barack Obama and Donald Trump opposed the $11 billion Nord Stream pipeline, which could double the amount of natural gas exported directly to Germany from Russia. But the Biden Administration has now blessed the project’s completion, handing Vladimir Putin a major strategic victory at the expense of Ukraine and Europe’s energy independence.<br />The White House says the pipeline was inevitable and improving America’s relationship with the Germans should come first. But the deal with Germany is embarrassing in its weakness. In a joint U.S.-German statement on Wednesday, Berlin pledges to impose sanctions in the future “should Russia attempt to use energy as a weapon or commit further aggressive acts against Ukraine.” We can hear them laughing in the Kremlin at that one.<br />The deal won’t go down well in Kyiv, which is struggling against Russian assaults on its territory. The country is set to lose billions in transit fees as Russian natural gas is diverted from routes that run through Ukraine. But at least “Germany commits to establish and administer a Green Fund for Ukraine to support Ukraine’s energy transition, energy efficiency, and energy security,” according to the joint statement. The U.S. and Germany say they’ll ask Russia to keep paying Ukraine. Are they kidding?<br />Giving a revisionist power more influence over Europe’s economy doesn’t help U.S. interests. The big win for Russian gas also comes as the Administration moves to restrict fossil-fuel production in the U.S. Angela Merkel, who negotiated the deal with President Biden, soon won’t even be Chancellor.</td>

      <td>Even the Speaker admits her veto of GOP members is ‘unprecedented.’</td>
      <td>When Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced her plan for a House Select Committee to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, she reserved eight members as her choice and left five for Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Well, scratch that. On Wednesday she vetoed two of Mr. McCarthy’s choices as unacceptable.<br />“With respect for the integrity of the investigation, with an insistence on the truth and with concern about statements made and actions taken by these Members, I must reject the recommendations of Representatives [Jim] Banks and [Jim] Jordan to the Select Committee,” the Speaker said in a statement. “The unprecedented nature of January 6th demands this unprecedented decision.”<br />She’s right that her decision is unprecedented. As Minority Leader in 2014, Mrs. Pelosi was allowed to choose her members for the House Select Committee investigating the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.<br />Messrs. Banks and Jordan are fierce partisans, but that can’t be the Speaker’s objection. Her Select Committee choices include Rep. Adam Schiff, who lied repeatedly about the evidence concerning the Trump campaign’s collusion with Russia. The two Republicans don’t share the Speaker’s view that Jan. 6 was an “insurrection,” or attempted coup. But if Mrs. Pelosi thinks the evidence for her conclusion is persuasive, why would she not want to have it tested against the most aggressive critics? Mr. Banks says he wants to focus on why the Capitol was so unprotected that day, which is certainly relevant and might reflect poorly on the Speaker.<br />Mr. McCarthy responded by saying he won’t appoint replacements and the GOP now won’t participate in the Select Committee. It’s hard to blame him. The rioters who broke the law are being punished, and the Select Committee’s partisan purpose has been clear from the start. The Speaker views the committee as a hammer to use against Republicans in 2022, and her veto of the two GOP members proves it.</td>

      <td>Actual liability doesn’t matter as the lawyers get rich as usual.</td>
      <td>This being America, the lawsuit capital of the world, it was probably inevitable that businesses would eventually settle the crush of opioid suits as a ransom to put the issue behind them. On Wednesday state Attorneys General  trumpeted a rich opioid settlement with drug distributors and  Johnson & Johnson ,  and there will surely be more.<br />Thousands of lawsuits have been filed around the country that seek to hold drug manufacturers, distributors and retailers liable for the opioid epidemic. Politicians and plaintiff attorneys claim the companies hooked hundreds of thousands of Americans on opioids with deceptive marketing and negligent dispensing practices to boost their bottom line.<br />The main problem with this argument is that opioids such as oxycodone require a doctor’s prescription. Thousands of doctors would have to have been complicit in the conspiracy. Ditto the Drug Enforcement Administration, which is supposed to monitor and control opioid shipments by distributors to pharmacies.<br />Opioid prescriptions have been declining since 2012, and the vast majority of overdose deaths are now from fentanyl sold on the street, often laced with other drugs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last week that opioid deaths increased by nearly 40% last year to 69,710 in 2020, though only 13,637 were from prescription painkillers.<br />But actual legal liability doesn’t count for much when the U.S. mass tort industry gets rolling. Businesses settle because they know they risk getting slammed with enormous jury verdicts if they go to trial.</td>

      <td>Trouble’s on the way both at home and abroad for Biden, as 2022 comes up fast.</td>
      <td>After six months in office, President Biden can claim some successes. He signed a $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill passed on a straight-party vote, began reassuring allies that America values them, and restored normality and decency to the presidency. But he faces an expanding list of challenges, and there are reasons to feel anxious about his ability to handle them.<br />A major problem for the president is the massive mismatch between the Democrats’ narrow margins in Congress—a handful of seats in the House and a 50-50 Senate—and his outsize policy expectations, many of which require large margins in the Senate to win approval. Mr. Biden pretends he has a mandate for transformational changes he didn’t really campaign on.<br />The mismatch is showing itself in the slow pace of congressional action. One example is the Democrats’ inability to move forward their unprecedented federal takeover of local elections. Time is becoming a critical problem for this and other initiatives, since Congress is scheduled to recess for August. Even if it doesn’t, the administration’s growing pileup of legislation won’t be easy to complete.<br />Consider the must-dos. There must be a budget resolution, which is difficult to get done. Though only a simple majority in each chamber is required, a resolution still needs to set allocations for the major parts of the budget. The debt ceiling must also be raised as early as August and, of course, a budget approved. And while it was easy for Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to agree to a global corporate tax rate, its passage through Congress is hardly assured.<br />Mr. Biden’s American Jobs Plan suffers from Bernie Sanders-style ambitions paired with the Democrats’ weak hold on Congress. The magnitude of the Biden tax increases are very unpopular in the suburbs, and the jump in capital-gains tax rates and taxes on inherited assets are detested in farm and ranch country. Moreover, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says the White House’s $3.5 trillion price tag is misleading. Kill the budget gimmicks and its true cost is $5 to $5.5 trillion. Voter resistance to these astronomical levels of spending is likely to grow.</td>

      <td>Decades of corruption and maladministration came to a head in last week’s riots. It’s time for real reform.</td>
      <td>A week of widespread rioting and looting in South Africa has ended. The turmoil’s cost is still being determined, but at least 276 people died, some of them trampled to death in stampedes, and the economic damage will run to billions of dollars. The country’s health infrastructure, already tottering under the weight of the Covid-19 pandemic, was virtually shattered in some areas by looting and arson. Major highways and a rail link were shut down for days.<br />The riots are barely over, so determining their “what” and “why” is difficult. The trigger was the jailing of the country’s former President Jacob Zuma, who was detained for ignoring a summons to appear before a commission investigating corruption. He has good cause to fear an inquiry. During his nine-year tenure, the country may have lost more than $34 billion to graft, according to his successor, President Cyril Ramaphosa. One of the most infamous scandals involved allegations that members of the wealthy Gupta family purchased so much influence with Mr. Zuma that they bartered cabinet positions in his government.<br />The deeper causes behind the unrest are murky. As with all South African presidents since the end of apartheid in 1994, Mr. Zuma was also head of the ruling African National Congress. The corruption scandals that embroiled him and the recession-prone economy over which he presided eventually made him a political liability, and the ANC forced him out in 2018. Yet a bloc of Zuma loyalists has continued to battle for power with Mr. Ramaphosa. Mr. Zuma’s arrest was a victory for Mr. Ramaphosa, as was the earlier suspension from the party of one of Mr. Zuma’s powerful allies.<br />The Ramaphosa government pins blame for the turmoil on Zuma supporters. Last week authorities said they had identified 12 ringleaders of what Mr. Ramaphosa called a “deliberate, coordinated and well-planned attack” on South Africa’s democracy. There may be a kernel of truth to that. Some pro-Zuma voices openly agitated for violence, and some of the attacks on infrastructure appeared to be coordinated.<br />Yet the scale and intensity of the unrest reveals a deeper problem. Mr. Ramaphosa’s political enemies could not have set parts of South Africa ablaze without the tinder provided by the ANC’s decadeslong mismanagement of the country. The ANC-led government’s bumbling during the HIV epidemic in the late 1990s and early 2000s likely cost more than 330,000 South African lives. Its aggressive affirmative action program, Black Economic Empowerment, has enriched a small clique of wealthy black South Africans while deterring investment. The 30% unemployment rate is essentially unchanged since 1994, and youth unemployment has climbed to a disastrous 74%. Blackouts, in Africa’s most industrialized economy, are common.</td>

      <td>They deserve support from my childhood friend as they battle the communists.</td>
      <td>The Cuban people are risking their lives by fighting to liberate themselves from the communist Castro regime. The Biden administration’s response has been weak. The worst moment came last week when Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told Cubans: “If you take to the sea, you will not come to the United States.”<br />I took that personally—not only because my family fled Fidel Castro’s Cuba for the U.S. in 1960, but because I know Mr. Mayorkas as “Ali,” a childhood friend from California and the son of my father’s best friend, Nicholas Mayorkas. My family and the Mayorkas family have ties stretching back to our parents’ childhood—two Cuban families that sought, and found, a better future for their children in America. Ali owes his success in no small part to the sacrifices his Republican father made in fleeing the Castro regime.<br />Here’s what Messrs. Biden and Mayorkas should do: They should express unwavering support for the Cuban people. They should continue the Trump administration’s hard-line policy toward the Castro regime, not enable it by pushing for reconciliation. They should maintain the economic embargo and Cuba’s listing as a state sponsor of terror. They should immediately provide the Cuban people with free and abundant internet access so they can document the abuses of their communist oppressors.<br />Instead, Mr. Biden and his fellow Democrats are offering misinformation. It is unacceptable to repeat the Cuban regime’s lies and pretend that this historic milestone in the Cuban people’s decadeslong struggle for freedom is merely a response to Covid-19. It is unacceptable to blame U.S. sanctions for Cuba’s misery. Communism is the failure here.<br />Liberal critics of American foreign policy often point to the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo, claiming that it undermines our moral authority. All of Cuba is a prison camp and has been for 62 years. Cuban families are now risking everything to bring change to the island of our birth. They deserve support from American leaders and the American people—including Mr. Biden and Ali Mayorkas, my childhood friend.</td>

      <td>The decision to shun the country has legal implications in many states and perhaps even at the federal level.</td>
      <td>Ben & Jerry’s, the Vermont-based ice-cream company that prides itself on its progressive politics, announced Monday that it is cancelling its license with its Israeli affiliate. The move by Ben & Jerry’s, a wholly owned subsidiary of global consumer-products giant  Unilever ,  amounts to a boycott of Israel. And this triggers a wave of legal and regulatory issues for the Dutch-American parent.<br />Ben & Jerry’s operates in Israel through a licensee, an Israeli company that has been with the brand for 30 years and operates one of its few foreign manufacturing facilities. After a social-media pressure campaign from anti-Israel leftists, the company insisted that the Israeli licensee not sell ice cream in parts of Jerusalem, including the Jewish Quarter, and the West Bank, much of which is controlled by the Palestinian Authority and parts of which are under Israeli civil jurisdiction.<br />Ben & Jerry’s knew this was an offer the licensee had to refuse. Parts of what the company calls “occupied Palestinian territory” Israel (as well as the U.S.) considers sovereign Israeli territory. Israeli law bars boycotts of Israeli citizens, Jewish or Arab, based on their location. So Unilever cancelled the Israeli Ben & Jerry’s entirely because it wouldn’t engage in a secondary boycott.<br />Because Ben & Jerry’s is a wholly owned subsidiary of Unilever, the latter is responsible for its boycott. In the past eight years, 33 American states have passed laws that restrict government contracting or investing in companies that boycott Israeli people or businesses. These laws are modeled on similar restrictions on companies that discriminate on other grounds, such as sexual orientation.<br />This means that, in about a dozen states, state employees’ pension funds will be barred from investment in Unilever. In many other states, government entities will be barred from buying goods or services from Unilever. Moreover, since the 1970s, federal law has banned U.S. companies from participating in foreign boycotts of any country. If it turns out that the Palestinian Authority contacted Ben & Jerry’s or its officers and asked them to boycott, criminal penalties would be available against Unilever.</td>

      <td>Needle exchanges, bleach kits and other forms of ‘harm reduction,’ though once controversial, are now mainstream. Will they stay that way?</td>
      <td>Fifty years ago, Richard Nixon declared what came to be known as the War on Drugs. The first of its two major campaigns was aimed at disrupting supply lines—from coca and poppy fields abroad to dealers in the U.S. The second was aimed at reducing demand: discouraging drug use, especially among teenagers, and providing treatment to those who had succumbed to addiction.<br />Both efforts continue today, with varying degrees of success (and failure). The second one in particular, over time, has required a change of tactics. It turned out that, when it comes to treatment, not all users want it, and even many of those who do may drop out of treatment programs. What to do about these hold-outs: people who have no intention of quitting drugs or who, having started in a program, find the prospect of quitting too daunting?<br />This is where “harm reduction” comes in. A classic example is clean-needle distribution, a practice that slims the odds of drug users becoming infected with Hepatitis C and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Harm-reduction workers “meet people where they are at,” as the slogan goes, without judgment. The approach is part of a larger effort to mitigate the effects of drug prohibition: e.g., the reluctance of users to seek medical help out of fear of arrest or to enter programs geared toward abstinence. The effort extends to providing apartments (the “housing-first” approach) where drug use is condoned. The idea is to embrace users and nudge them toward social functioning, even toward abstinence—but on the client’s time line.<br />Science journalist Maia Szalavitz has been an avid participant in the “harm-reduction movement” since her days of heavy drug use. In “Undoing Drugs,” she tells her own story and offers the first popular account of the movement’s people and politics.<br />In 1986, the 20-year-old Ms. Szalavitz was living in New York’s East Village, having been suspended from Columbia University for dealing cocaine and now injecting cocaine and heroin. At the time, she didn’t know that needle sharing put her at risk for HIV. When an acquaintance warned her against sharing needles and, if she did share, urged to run bleach through the syringe, she was “furious” that such information wasn’t widely known.</td>

      <td>PG&E Corp. said Wednesday that it plans to bury 10,000 miles of power lines to reduce wildfire risk throughout Northern California at an estimated cost of up to $20 billion, reversing its earlier stance that doing so would be prohibitively expensive.<br />The utility company, which serves about 16 million customers in northern and central California, said the effort will substantially reduce the likelihood of its power lines sparking wildfires as drought and climate change heighten the risk of large, fast-moving blazes.<br />“We know that we have long argued that undergrounding was too expensive,” Chief Executive Patti Poppe said. “This is where we say it’s too expensive not to underground. Lives are on the line.”<br />PG&E’s equipment has ignited more than 20 California wildfires within the past several years that have collectively killed more than 100 people and burned thousands of homes. Most of the fires were sparked when trees or branches touched the company’s wires.<br />PG&E disclosed to California regulators earlier this week that one of its power lines may have been involved in the ignition of one of the fires currently ravaging the West, the Dixie Fire, which has grown to cover more than 85,000 acres in Northern California. The company said in a regulatory filing that an employee responding to a power outage discovered a fire beneath one of its distribution lines in the Feather River Canyon in the forested Sierra Nevada foothills.</td>

In trying to track all the non-Covid deaths, there are a number of unresolved issues. Reports Ms. McKay:<br />There are so many questions here, such as how cancer mortality could have declined in a year when so many were skipping cancer screenings and treatments. Were some deaths that otherwise might have been ascribed to cancer or bronchitis categorized as Covid fatalities?<br />The government says that after Covid, the biggest contributor to the decline in overall life expectancy was an increase in the category of “unintentional injuries.” We already know a big part of this tragic story during the year of lockdowns.

      <td>Deal could bring an end to thousands of lawsuits blaming Johnson & Johnson and the nation’s largest drug distributors for an epidemic in painkiller addiction</td>
      <td>States unveiled a historic $26 billion settlement with drug companies to resolve thousands of opioid-crisis lawsuits, paving the way for communities across the country to secure a jolt of funding to address an epidemic in painkiller addiction that hasn’t abated.<br />The nation’s three largest drug distributors— McKesson Corp. ,  AmerisourceBergen Corp. , and Cardinal Health Inc.—and drugmaker  Johnson & Johnson  have been negotiating the deal for more than two years, but Wednesday’s announcement signifies an important milestone that could clear the way for money to be received by states as soon as early next year.<br />States can’t use the money to fill general budget holes, as they did after a $206 billion deal with tobacco companies in the 1990s. Instead, the majority must be spent on social services to address the harms of opioid addiction, like treatment programs, education on how to dispose of pills and needles, and bolstered funds for first responders. One community may use it to help a large problem of addiction in the homeless population, while another may be more focused on opioid-addicted babies.<br />“It won’t be used to fill potholes, or build libraries, or balance budgets,” said Paul Geller, a plaintiffs’ lawyer representing several cities and counties involved in the deal.<br />Individuals and families who have been affected by opioid abuse won’t receive any money directly.</td>

      <td>St. Regis, the latest structure by Windy City architect Jeanne Gang, is a mixed-use tower that undulates as it rises and is the tallest building designed by a woman.</td>
      <td>Chicago<br />Do not confuse the shape of a fashionable residential tower with the artistic line drawn by an architect. It is the line of truce after a battle. A developer fights to expand his territory, his holy volume of rentable space, and the architect pushes back, trying to carve and sculpt that volume, and to make it beautiful. The developer wins, of course, giving us the box with an all-glass skin that is the industry standard of high-rise housing.<br />But there are exceptions. The three interlocking and progressively taller towers that make up the St. Regis Chicago, this city’s newest and most prominent residential and hotel development, are as exquisitely contoured as a work of abstract sculpture. Each successive level is set back five inches and then, once 12 stories are reached, the process is reversed and the levels start to step outward. These 12-story modules have the shape of a decapitated pyramid--the technical term is “frustum”—and in their alternating inward and outward taper the towers call to mind Brancusi’s celebrated Endless Column. Yet for all their slenderness they manage to accommodate a daunting 1.9 million square feet, a colossal amount of residential and hotel space, in the most elegant fashion imaginable.<br />The St. Regis Chicago (which began life on the drawing board in 2014 as the Wanda Vista Tower) was meant to open last year, but after the inevitable delays it is opening only now. The 393 condominiums on the upper levels are partially occupied while its 191-room hotel and restaurant are still under construction. Nonetheless, it is sufficiently complete to take its measure. Prominently sited on the Chicago River, just east of Lake Michigan, it rises a full 101 stories, making it the city’s third-tallest building. It is easily the most important addition to the Chicago skyline in a generation—no small feat in America’s most celebrated architectural city.<br />The building is the work of Studio Gang, the Chicago firm with a knack for drawing aesthetic lessons from purely technical considerations. For nearly a decade it has been experimenting with “solar carving,” its term for the shaping of a building in accordance with the moving path of the sun. With the St. Regis, the calculations were unusually complex. As its girth varies, so does the relative amount of sunlight it receives, the heat gain rising as the footprint shrinks. To offset the difference, the architects hit upon the idea of progressively tinting the glass so that each floor receives the exact same quantity of sunlight and heat.</td>

      <td>This year, the New York Guitar Festival honors the legacy of classical guitarist Julian Bream with an impressive lineup of virtual performances.</td>
      <td><br />The New York Guitar Festival, presented biennially since 1999, has avoided stylistic pigeonholing by shifting its focus with each installment: a classical guitar potpourri might be followed by a festival built around the music of Bruce Springsteen, an influential bluesman like the Rev. Gary Davis or a Gospel-rocker like Sister Rosetta Tharpe. And within an announced theme, the variety of players and interpretive approaches is typically broad, thanks no doubt to the eclectic tastes of the festival’s founders, David Spelman, a classical guitarist turned entrepreneur, and John Schaefer, the host of several influential new-music programs on WNYC.<br />This year’s edition was nearly doomed by the pandemic, but Mr. Spelman had his heart set on a tribute to Julian Bream, the British virtuoso who died in August, at age 87. His solution was to invite 18 guitarists and three lutenists to submit video performances, and to post three clips daily between July 14 and 20 on the festival’s YouTube page. They can be viewed there indefinitely, along with recordings from past festivals.<br />“Remembering Julian Bream” has a starry roster that includes Eliot Fisk, Sharon Isbin, Pepe Romero, David Leisner, Paul O’Dette, Hopkinson Smith, Jason Vieaux and several promising younger players performing music associated with Bream. But the festival’s heart is a half-dozen commissioned works, all by guitarists who also compose.<br />Most listeners still think of Andrés Segovia as the architect of the modern classical guitar world, and there is no denying that Segovia reconfigured attitudes about the instrument. But Bream’s contributions were far more significant. Where Segovia’s interpretive style was self-consciously Romantic, Bream’s readings were streamlined and modern, yet sacrificed nothing in warmth or emotional weight. He also had an early place in the period instrument world, having revived the Renaissance lute and its repertory. And most crucially, where Segovia was content with works by composers who were barely known outside the guitar world, Bream commissioned music from composers with international reputations, among them Benjamin Britten, William Walton, Michael Tippett, Hans Werner Henze, Toru Takemitsu and dozens more, many of which have become centerpieces of the guitar’s repertory.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Federal Trade Commission said it wants to give consumers more power to fix devices such as smartphones and home appliances, voting to step up efforts targeting manufacturers if the agency determines repair restrictions are illegal.<br />The FTC unanimously adopted a new policy Wednesday laying out concerns about device-repair restrictions and said it would investigate them. The bipartisan vote followed an executive order signed July 9 by President Biden directing the FTC to consider writing rules to address “unfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party repair or self-repair of items.”<br />Manufacturers restrict the repair of their equipment by limiting the availability of parts and repair information, steering consumers to their own repair networks, claiming patent and trademark rights and designing products in ways that make repairs more difficult, according to the FTC.<br />Consumer-advocacy groups and repair companies want policymakers to back what they call “Right to Repair.” They argue manufacturers in a range of industries, from  Apple Inc.  smartphones to  Deere  & Co. tractors, make it too hard for consumers to get the parts and information needed to fix devices. They also say that manufacturers design products in ways that make repairs difficult and restrict competition among repair technicians, which can make fixes more expensive.<br />Lina Khan, the new chairwoman of the FTC, backed those concerns Wednesday. “These types of restrictions can significantly raise costs for consumers, stifle innovation, close off business opportunities for independent repair shops, create unnecessary electronic waste, [and] delay timely repairs,” she said at a virtual public meeting.</td>

      <td>Despite fears of car supply availability, auto dealers aren’t running into any speed bumps just yet.<br />Both  Lithia Motors  and  AutoNation —dealers selling new and used vehicles—reported record revenue and profits last quarter. Lithia Motors said on Wednesday morning that its second quarter sales surged 118% compared with a year earlier; AutoNation’s sales jumped 54% in the same period.<br />New vehicle shipments seem to be catching up: They were down just 6% last quarter compared with 2019 levels, AutoNation noted on its earnings call on Monday. Demand still far outpaces supply, however. At AutoNation, there were just 14 days’ worth of inventory available for new vehicles; Lithia had 23 days’ worth. Dealers typically have 50 days or more worth of new car inventory on hand.<br />That mismatch between supply and demand comes with all kinds of perks for the dealers: Not only are they commanding higher prices, but they have also been paying less interest on floor-plan loans, which are typically used to finance floor inventory.<br />With more cars immediately sold off lots, AutoNation said it paid less than half in floor-plan interest expenses last quarter compared with a year earlier. Thanks to those favorable economics, net income at Lithia almost quadrupled last quarter compared with a year earlier, while profit at AutoNation—excluding discontinued operations—tripled.</td>

      <td>AS A YOUNG CHEF Ryan Bartlow chanced on the “El Bulli” cookbook by Spanish molecular gastronomist Ferran Adrià and was duly wowed. “I’d never seen food like this,” he said of the avant-garde recipes. Mr. Bartlow made his way to a triple-Michelin-starred restaurant outside San Sabastián, where he cooked complicated meals for a year.<br />While he was there, however, the Spanish cooking that captured his heart was more homespun. Now, at Ernesto’s in Manhattan, he serves rustic classics like this chilled soup topped with hard-boiled eggs and tuna preserved in olive oil, a version of southern Spain’s salmorejo. “It’s humble food,” Mr. Barlow said of his first Slow Food Fast recipe. “It has a soul.”<br />Made with tomatoes, garlic, onions and toasted bread, it’s a bit thicker than gazpacho. The ingredients sit together in a bowl until the bread absorbs all the juices. A quick blitz in the blender produces a creamy soup.<br />The bread provides the necessary body to support the toppings. “The egg should be hard-boiled for texture. And the tuna should be left in large flakes,” said Mr. Barlow. “They should sit on the soup, not sink into it.”<br />In such a simple recipe, quality ingredients count. We’re finally in the season when tomatoes are truly gorgeous; splurge on good olive oil and vinegar. Mr. Bartlow’s advice for this recipe pretty much sums up his approach overall: “Everything should be good and kept simple.”</td>

When completed, the project will bypass an existing pipeline network in Ukraine, a prospect that has concerned many in Kyiv, who see the existing route as a check against Russia.<br />Under the U.S.-Germany agreement, Berlin and Washington agreed to help Ukraine in energy-related projects and diplomacy. The U.S. and Germany will also try to ensure that Ukraine continues to receive roughly $3 billion in annual transit fees that Russia pays under its current agreement with Kyiv, which runs through 2024.</td>

      <td>ASML’s major expansion looks like a solid bet, as subsidies for domestic production could offset limits to sales in China</td>
      <td>The extremely expensive nature of chip manufacturing makes efficiency paramount. But for some producers of chip manufacturing equipment, inefficiency could become a saving grace.<br />Consider ASML. The Dutch company’s extreme ultraviolet lithography, or EUV, tools are so key to advanced chipmaking that semiconductor manufacturers looking to produce cutting-edge processors for products such as personal computers, smartphones, data centers and network gear simply can’t get by without them. That also has made ASML into a key weapon in the global semiconductor Cold War that keeps warming up. The U.S. has leaned on the Dutch government to prevent those EUV tools from being shipped to Chinese chip makers.<br />That poses a problem for ASML, given that China is now the world’s top market for semiconductor equipment, accounting for 26% of global sales last year, according to the SEMI industry trade group.<br />But politics is affecting the chip equipment market in other ways, too. The U.S. and European governments have focused on beefing their own domestic chipmaking abilities in the wake of a massive global production shortage. That is resulting in direct government support for the sector. The U.S. Senate passed a bill last month calling for $52 billion in subsidies to support domestic chip production.<br />Chip fabrication facilities are expensive to build and equip so manufacturers typically manage their expansion carefully to match global demand. But a jump in fabs thanks to government subsidies will likely introduce some inefficiencies into the system. ASML Chief Executive Peter Wennink said on his company’s second-quarter call Wednesday that such inefficiencies will likely result in additional equipment demand. He also predicted that the inefficiency “will be managed rationally by a few very large manufacturers.”</td>

A U.S. request for a so-called kill-switch clause, enabling Berlin to suspend gas flows in the event of Russian aggression toward its neighbors or Western allies, wasn’t included, officials said.<br />U.S. officials under two previous presidential administrations opposed Nord Stream 2, seeing it as a way for Moscow to heighten its economic and political sway across Europe and trying to stop the project through international pressure and sanctions.<br />President Biden, seeking closer ties with Europe and with Berlin in particular, took a different approach. While still opposing the pipeline, his administration said it was too far along to prevent its completion.</td>

      <td>With barber shops closed during lockdown, many men let their hair grow. Ease and nostalgia have inspired some to keep it lengthy. Here, how to do it right.</td>
      <td>WHEN BARBERSHOPS closed early in lockdown, men wishing to avoid tragic DIY cuts had two options: Buzz their locks or let them flourish. With no in-person meetings, those who chose the latter could hide the awkward in-between phase and nurture their mops from the safety of home. In time, glorious manes grew. And lots of men liked what they saw.<br />As the U.S. reopens, plenty of once-cropped corporate types are opting to keep their flowing tresses. Soon enough, men with a passing resemblance to apostles, rock stars and Beat poets could populate boardrooms.<br />Audrey Hootman, owner of Talc + Tonic, a Chicago salon with a corporate-leaning clientele, reported a recent uptick in long-haired patrons aged 26 to 36. And when Takamichi Saeki reopened his Manhattan salon in mid- 2020, about 60% of his customers—including lawyers and bankers, even ones in their 60s—came in with collar-brushing hair. Of those, “more than half” have kept things long—and many have requested Brad Pitt’s shag.<br />While some men find maintaining long styles a time suck—more hair equals more strands to misbehave—others argue the opposite. Mr. Saeki said long cuts need a trim every two to three months as opposed to monthly for shorter styles. He suggests washing and conditioning every two or three days and then using hair cream and oil—or matte wax for a slicked-back look—to sweep hair off the face.<br />Fredric Cibelli, 44, a partner at Ernst & Young in New York, finds his chin-length ’do easier to manage than a short-back-and-sides. When styling, he combs it and tucks it behind his ears, sometimes with a dab of wax. “It’s not a whole rigmarole every morning.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The federal government will most likely run out of cash to pay its bills in October or November unless Congress increases or suspends the federal borrowing limit, the Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday.<br />Congress voted in 2019 to suspend the debt ceiling until July 31 of this year. Since then, the nation has added $6.5 trillion in debt, bringing the total amount owed to $28.5 trillion.<br />If lawmakers can’t reach another agreement before the end of the month, the borrowing limit would automatically be reinstated at that level, and the Treasury wouldn’t be able to raise additional cash from the sale of government securities.<br />If it can’t raise new cash, the Treasury has said it would take extraordinary measures to keep paying the government’s bills in full and on time, as it has in the past. Those measures, such as redeeming certain investments in federal pension programs and suspending new investments in those programs, have previously freed up enough cash to last several months.<br />But Treasury officials have warned Congress that such measures could be exhausted more quickly than in the past. Secretary Janet Yellen said in a June hearing that the pandemic has increased uncertainty about the size and timing of government spending, adding that the Treasury could run out of room to pay the government’s bills as early as August.</td>

They have affected scores of U.S. officials posted overseas over the last five years, and are sometimes known as “Havana Syndrome” because the symptoms were first reported in 2016 by diplomats at the U.S. Embassy in Havana.<br />A scientific panel under the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine in December said some form of directed energy emissions were the most likely culprit for the symptoms experienced by U.S. officials, which include dizziness, severe headaches, nausea and cognitive difficulties.<br />Mr. Burns, who became CIA director in March, has said that identifying the source of the attacks and getting treatment for affected agency personnel are among his top priorities. Some current and former intelligence officials suspect Russia is behind the attacks, but that remains unproven and Moscow has denied involvement.<br />The task force, which was formed last December, is composed of specialists from across the agency and includes intelligence analysts, clandestine officers who collect human intelligence, clinicians and human resource specialists, a U.S. official familiar with the issue said.</td>

But July’s extension marks the first time the governments weren’t in lockstep.<br />On Monday, Canada said it would allow fully vaccinated Americans to visit Canada beginning on Aug. 9, with plans to welcome other nationalities beginning in September.<br />The country made the unilateral decision after its vaccination rate surpassed that of the U.S. Nearly 52% of Canadians are fully vaccinated, according to the University of Oxford’s Our World in Data.

The U.K. left the bloc in January 2020.<br />The arrangements, known as the protocol, saw the U.K. agree to customs and regulatory checks on goods, including farm products, moving across the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland from mainland Britain to prevent products made under British regulations from leaking into Ireland and the EU’s single market. There were exceptions for goods that were clearly intended to stay in Northern Ireland.<br />For months now, the U.K. and the EU have been sparring over the protocol’s implementation, with the U.K. arguing that the EU was rigidly interpreting the deal and denying smooth access to the people in Northern Ireland of some food products, medicine and even of dogs needed to help the visually impaired.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday rejected two of five Republicans chosen by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to serve on the Democratic-led select committee investigating the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, saying that their involvement would hurt the integrity of the probe.<br />Mrs. Pelosi (D., Calif.) said in a statement that she had spoken with Mr. McCarthy (R., Calif.) about unspecified objections raised about the two lawmakers: Rep. Jim Banks (R., Ind.), chair of the conservative Republican Study Committee, to serve as the select committee’s top-ranking GOP member, and Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee.<br />“With respect for the integrity of the investigation, with an insistence on the truth and with concern about statements made and actions taken by these members, I must reject the recommendations” of the two lawmakers, Mrs. Pelosi said. “The unprecedented nature of Jan. 6th demands this unprecedented decision.”<br />The speaker said she was willing to appoint the other GOP members tapped by Mr. McCarthy: Reps. Rodney Davis of Illinois, Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota and Troy Nehls of Texas. She requested that Mr. McCarthy recommend two other members to replace Messrs. Banks and Jordan.<br />Mr. McCarthy said in a statement that Mrs. Pelosi’s denial of his picks “represents an egregious abuse of power” that will damage Congress. “Denying the voices of members who have served in the military and law enforcement, as well as leaders of standing committees, has made it undeniable that this panel has lost all legitimacy and credibility,” he said.</td>

      <td>THAT AFTERNOON in Atlanta, Jared Rodriguez probably should have been paying attention to his CEO’s lecture. Instead, the sales representative was glued to a live stream of his own Auburn, Calif., dining room. There, his smart “puppy cam” was recording his 9-month-old St. Bernard puppies assume the less adorable characteristics of rabid wolves. “I’m watching as they start chewing up their beds,” said Mr. Rodriguez, 47, whose wife was at work. “I ran out of the meeting…and was yelling at my dogs to stop destroying their beds on my phone while my boss was giving a speech.” Because the puppy cam has a built-in speaker, the dogs perked, ceased and desisted, he said: “That’s why we got that camera in the first place.”<br />While nearly any Wi-Fi-based security camera can monitor a dog, pet tech specifically designed to help dog owners has evolved. Your pup would prefer your company—and probably got spoiled by it during the pandemic. But if you’re returning to the office, or don’t want to cut happy hour short to rush home and relieve him, smart tech can fill the gap. Here, our picks for turning your house into a tech-enabled doggy daycare.<br />If you’ve ever guiltily wished your dog could play fetch with himself, the iFetch Too is a savior for sore arms and temporarily absentee owners. Train your dog to drop tennis balls into the top of the pod and the robot will sling them 10 to 40 feet up to 250 times on a single charge. Put the device in a fenced-in backyard, or set it for a 10-foot trajectory in a large room or long hallway. (You can aim the machine so balls don’t go flying into furniture.) $200, goifetch.com<br /><br />Un like a standard security camera, the PetChatz HDX attaches low on a wall, at your dog’s height, so he can see your face pop up on the 2 3/4-inch-wide screen. A companion smartphone app lets you call in to your pet, voicing reassurance via the device’s speaker—and even dispense treats from the built-in canister. “Our puppy got used to having us home [during the pandemic], so when we left for a couple of hours, he destroyed everything in sight,” said Michelle Rosaline, who uses a treat-dispensing camera for her Rhodesian Ridgeback. Now, she said, even when the family’s at a restaurant, her kids talk to him through the phone, remotely “throwing treats in the air, and watching him jump for joy.” For next-level communication, add in PawCall ($100), a wireless button that rests on the floor and, bizarrely, allows your pet to initiate a call to you. If you have a needy, clever pug with poor timing, this might not be the breakthrough you want. $350, petchatz.com</td>

      <td>An appeals court takes a second look at whether the law protects Big Tech from discrimination claims.</td>
      <td>Big Tech platforms claim that U.S. law gives them almost unlimited power to ban content and users they deem objectionable. But a case pending before the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals calls that assumption into question.<br />It started when the video-hosting platform Vimeo deleted the account of Newport Beach, Calif.-based Church United after its founder, James Domen, posted five videos discussing what Vimeo calls “sexual orientation change efforts,” the promotion of which the site forbids. Mr. Domen, who describes himself as a former homosexual, claims the banishment constituted discrimination based on both religion and sexual orientation, in violation of state and federal civil-rights laws. He also argues that Vimeo’s censorship violates the California Constitution, which state courts have interpreted to protect individuals’ rights to speak and assemble in privately owned spaces such as shopping centers.<br />A federal magistrate judge in New York, where Vimeo is headquartered, dismissed Mr. Domen’s complaint, noting that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act shields “interactive computer services” like Vimeo from lawsuits for “any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.”<br />A three-judge Second Circuit panel upheld the dismissal in March, again citing Section 230, under which, Judge Rosemary Pooler wrote, “Vimeo is free to restrict access to material that, in good faith, it finds objectionable.”<br />Vimeo, however, didn’t stop at restricting access to the videos, or even at deleting them. It wiped out the church’s entire account. That would seem to strengthen Mr. Domen’s claim of discrimination, since he and Church United, not merely some of their content, were unwelcome. But he didn’t have an opportunity to make that case, because the judges held that Section 230 pre-empts the discrimination complaint.</td>

Targeted industries cover the state’s entire economy—from hospitals to hotels, table-service restaurants to tech companies, prestigious movie studios to prestigious universities.<br />The California Chamber of Commerce identifies PAGA as a key impediment to restoring the state’s economic health. Even powerful labor unions have taken notice; SEIU California recently endorsed legislation sponsored by state Sen. Robert Hertzberg that would exempt certain unionized janitorial companies from the law.<br />PAGA is a unique enforcement mechanism for California’s 1,100-page labor code. Signed into law in 2003 by Gov. Gray Davis, it deputizes plaintiffs and their lawyers to act with the enforcement authority of the state’s Labor Agency. Under PAGA, trial lawyers are empowered to pursue crushing financial penalties for any violation of the state’s labor code, no matter how minor. Even a typo on a pay stub is a labor law violation.<br />PAGA was pitched as a solution to relieve the burden on California’s Labor and Workforce Development Agency. The opposite has happened. Trial lawyers discovered that PAGA is an “unmatched weapon” for tormenting employers and now file thousands of notices annually under the law. The state has acknowledged that it reviews only a small fraction of them. Many contain allegations that are settled out of court, leaving the state without any indication if employees were properly compensated under the deal.</td>

He is the fourth person to be charged in connection with the July 2020 hack, which hijacked high-profile  Twitter  accounts to post messages that solicited donations to a bitcoin wallet for causes such as Covid-19 relief efforts.

He is also charged with intrusions related to account takeovers of TikTok and Snapchat users, according to court documents, and is charged with cyberstalking a juvenile.<br />The attack on Twitter allowed hackers to take over an array of accounts—others included were those of Kanye West, Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey and  Apple Inc .<br />The disruption, coming just a few months before a presidential election, prompted national security concerns among some U.S. officials due to the platform’s role in public discourse, international affairs and government messaging.

At stake is whether advanced economies with high vaccination rates can enjoy something approaching pre-pandemic life in the face of fast transmitting versions of the virus.<br />The experiment should give a strong signal of whether Covid-19 can be relegated to the status of a manageable, seasonal menace such as influenza and whether lockdowns and social distancing can be consigned to the past.<br />In England, almost all Covid-era restrictions were lifted Monday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he wants Britons to judge for themselves whether to wear a face covering, dance at a nightclub or skip a big gathering.<br />The shift comes even as caseloads rise rapidly—the U.K. is recording close to 50,000 daily cases, more than reported in Brazil, India, Indonesia or South Africa. The government justifies its actions by pointing to hospitalization rates and deaths that are way below what they were in earlier waves of the pandemic.<br />The strategy puts the U.K. at odds with its neighbors in Europe, parts of the U.S., and other highly-vaccinated countries such as Israel, where vaccine rollouts are going hand-in-hand with the tightening of some public health measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing to stem the Delta variant’s spread.</td>

It was the largest single-year decline recorded since 1943. It isn’t entirely clear what caused the drop that year, when the U.S. was fighting World War II.<br />“I myself had never seen a change this big except in the history books,” said Elizabeth Arias, a demographer at the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics and lead author of the report.<br />Life expectancy won’t recover to pre-pandemic levels in 2021, Dr. Arias and other population-health experts said, and could decline again if a new Covid-19 variant emerges that vaccines don’t protect against, some said. The highly transmissible Delta variant of the virus has pushed cases, hospitalizations and deaths up again recently, particularly in parts of the country where vaccination rates are low.<br />The full toll of the pandemic has yet to be seen, doctors and public-health officials said. Many people skipped or delayed treatment last year for conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure, and endured isolation, stress and interruptions in normal diet and exercise routines.</td>

      <td>Frappato is fresh, bright and easy to pair with both seafood and meat—a happy medium between a red and a white. Our wine columnist shares her favorite bottles.</td>
      <td>WITH A NAME like a lively dance step and a flavor profile so juicy and bright that it’s frequently described as falling somewhere between a red and a white, Frappato is one of my absolute favorite summertime wines. I only wish it were easier to find. Indeed, I’m tempted to keep this wine a secret strictly on the basis of scarcity. But it’s simply too good not to share.<br />Native to Sicily, the Frappato grape is, as far as I can ascertain, still grown only on that island. It’s long been thought that Frappato is a relative of Sangiovese, the red grape of Tuscany, and the results of at least one DNA test seem to confirm that, but the link isn’t a complete certainty. The two grapes produce wines that seem quite different to me. I find Frappato much lighter and brighter with a brisk, bitter cherry note and a beguiling perfume.<br />In the definitive “Native Wine Grapes of Italy,” Ian D’Agata calls Frappato “the variety responsible for some of Sicily’s most delicious unknown wines.” He notes that (as of the book’s 2014 publication) the grape accounts for less than 1% of Sicily’s overall vineyard acreage, “making Frappato only the 17th most-planted variety in Sicily.”<br />I don’t know which Sicilian grape varieties ranked one through 16, but I can’t imagine many of them produce a more delicious wine than the Frappato from COS, a winery located in the Vittoria region of southeastern Sicily, where the best Frappato grows.<br />COS derives its name from the first letter of each of the last names of the three founding winery partners: Giambattista Cilia, Giusto Occhipinti and Cirino Strano. When the three partners founded COS in 1980, great Sicilian wine was a distant vision if not an outright oxymoron, but their winery soon became one of the standard bearers of well made wine from Sicily. COS became especially well known for Cerasuolo di Vittoria, the flagship red of the region as well as the name of the appellation.</td>

Sadly, the fine print reveals that the supposed consensus rests on Mr. Goodman’s proposal “to create territorial contiguity between Palestinian autonomous islands in the West Bank, connect this Palestinian autonomy to the wider world, and promote Palestinian economic prosperity and independence.”<br />Haven’t we seen this movie before? Mr. Goodman’s program closely replicates Shimon Peres’s “New Middle East” and the Oslo Accords of 1993, when Israelis made major concessions in the innocent hope that Yasser Arafat, Mahmoud Abbas and their henchmen would respond with goodwill. We know now how that turned out.<br />As a historian, I regret to report that conflicts typically end not with goodwill gestures but with one side giving up on its war goals. Think: 1865, 1945, 1975 and 1991. Handsome apartments and late-model cars will not spur Palestinians to accept Israel; this will happen only after they recognize the futility of their dream to eliminate the Jewish state. Israeli victory, not Palestinian prosperity, leads to peace.<br />Just as the Germans gained immeasurably by giving up on their aggression, so can the Palestinians. Only when they accept their neighbor can this skilled and dignified people build the polity, economy, society and culture worthy of them.<br />Daniel Pipes</td>

      <td>Regarding Kate Bachelder Odell’s “If War Comes, Will the U.S. Navy Be Prepared?” (op-ed, July 12): My late father-in-law, Russel Lavallee, was serving aboard the aircraft carrier Lexington on Dec. 7, 1941. “We were expecting trouble in the Pacific, but we were only ready for inspection,” he observed. Apparently, not much has changed.<br />After the Lexington was sunk, he was transferred to the carrier Enterprise in time for our miraculous victory at Midway. Here too, however, sailors and airmen paid the price for our lack of preparedness. The Navy’s slow, obsolete Devastator torpedo planes had malfunctioning torpedoes. “We got only a couple of our torpedo planes back,” he said. “They didn’t even get a hit. It was suicide.”<br />After the Battle of Santa Cruz, the situation was dire. Then, the “most beautiful sight in the world”: The American people had built “an entire new fleet of big, beautiful Essex-class carriers,” which steamed to the rescue. Ordinary sailors and airmen in the unprepared Navy had bought with their blood time for the American people to face the reality of war. Given that we have offshored much of our manufacturing capability, could our Navy face war with a major power today?<br />Art DeJong<br />Sheboygan, Wis.</td>

After graduating from UCLA, I found myself newly divorced, broke and debt-burdened. Going back to my local community college didn’t feel like a letdown but rather a relief. It gave me hope. I was able to get my RN certificate and take my nursing-boards exam and was offered a job before I finished the program.<br />For 35 years it has afforded me a challenging but rewarding career I could be proud of, a salary that enabled me to pay off my student loans from UCLA, and a lifestyle that has made it all worthwhile. People think community colleges mean one couldn’t afford a more expensive, better education.

      <td>Power went out and water seeped into Foxconn’s Zhengzhou site, employees say, but damage appears limited</td>
      <td>TAIPEI—The severe flooding in central China cut power temporarily at Apple Inc.’s biggest iPhone manufacturing site as water seeped into some areas and the site’s operator gave many workers time off, said factory employees there.<br />The damage to the manufacturing hub in Zhengzhou city, Henan province, however, appeared limited, the workers said. Taiwan-based Foxconn Technology Group operates three factories in the city with hundreds of thousands of workers—many of them living on factory campuses—producing more than half the world’s iPhones, according to analysts.<br />Foxconn said that it has implemented an emergency response plan for flood control but there had been no direct impact to its facilities from the flooding.<br />The potential disruption to production arrives just as Apple suppliers start to gear up for this year’s new iPhone models, expected to be launched in the fall. Assembly of the new models and their components generally starts around July and ramps up in the following weeks.<br />Henan officials said Wednesday that at least 25 people have died and more than 1.2 million have been impacted by the flood, which started with heavy rains on Saturday. Local news and social media showed passengers stuck on subway cars in waist-deep water and vehicles submerged in flooded streets. Trains and flights were canceled, while many sections of highways in the region were closed.</td>

      <td>Robinhood Markets likes to give away free shares to attract new customers. Its public offering to investors is a different matter.<br />The offering bears some similarity to recent IPOs such as  Coinbase Global  and Rocket Cos., which made their debut in the midst of crypto and mortgage booms, respectively. Investors had the challenge of trying to chart out a normalized earnings and revenue path. So far, neither of those prior examples have worked out for initial public investors.<br />Robinhood derives the vast majority of its revenue from trading by its customers, including in cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin. In this topsy-turvy market, it will be quite difficult to forecast what that activity level looks like a year from now. Plus, its primary trading revenue source is payment for order flow, one of the most hotly debated topics in finance and in Washington.<br />Amid that uncertainty, there is one measure that cuts through a lot of the noise: how much an investor would be paying at the IPO valuation per funded account. That is a way to benchmark Robinhood to established peers in the retail brokerage business.<br />At the proposed IPO price range set on Monday, a funded Robinhood customer account is valued at about $1,500 to $1,600. Contrast that to a long-term average of about $2,000 per account for E*Trade over the past 15 years, before it was acquired for about $1,800 per account by Morgan Stanley, according to figures compiled by Christian Bolu of Autonomous Research. Charles Schwab, a much broader wealth- and asset-management business, has traded around $3,600 historically, and is closer to $4,000 today.</td>

      <td>SOON after Chauncey Boothby was tasked with outfitting a toddler’s room in Chappaqua, N.Y., the designer happened upon a lithograph by author and illustrator Ludwig Bemelmans. In the artist’s playful but urbane style, his waggish heroine Madeline confronts a tiger in a tented cage—ideal inspiration for an interior designer working to marry whimsy with a sophistication that will carry a young child named Maddie, now 4, into her tweens.<br />The resulting en suite bedroom is one of the cheerful refreshes Ms. Boothby, based in Rowayton, Conn., has been asked for lately as young and old attempt to shake off the last 16 months. Home-study areas in particular, she said, had “been shrouded in a veil of dread.”<br />Ms. Boothby made a happy leap from the palette in the Bemelmans work to Ottoline’s Sporty Stripes fabric, which she used to canopy the bed and upholster the desk and window seats. “Bringing in some of the darker greens makes it less totally childish,” she said. The most juvenile elements—a modern tea set, cutesy animals and puffy corduroy stars pinned to the wall—can easily be swapped out as Maddie ages.<br />Here, Ms. Boothby’s other strategies for straddling the taste of tots, tweens and, let’s be frank, adults.<br />The Bemelmans litho that sparked the room’s stripe-y design hangs against Japanese paper woven in sobering tones of gray. The clients had asked that the space not be too girlie, and the wallcovering, a holdover from the suite’s life as guest quarters, worked as a neutral background. Colors in the artwork and stripe textile include pale pink, found in the accessories; pear green (the desk); and orange (the metal lamp shade). Limited ornamentation, like the scalloped lamp shade and fluted cup, helps maintain a balance of serious and saccharine. Ms. Boothby gave each of the room’s many animals, like the zebra lamp and tiny felt lion here, its own little moment, as if it was “on display at the zoo.”</td>

      <td>Auto investors need to pay attention to the semiconductor industry, but the rise of in-vehicle computers matters more than the current microchip shortage</td>
      <td>Investors can afford to mute much of the noise about this year’s microchip shortage as car manufacturers report second-quarter earnings. They should, however, pay closer attention to any strategic deals between the two industries.<br />Daimler kicked off the results season for car makers Wednesday with an adjusted operating margin of 12.8% in its flagship  Mercedes-Benz  division, which is very high by industry standards. Its shares fell at the open, though. The company prereleased key results last week because they were running well ahead of analyst forecasts. This week’s most striking incremental news was that it no longer expects growth in sales of Mercedes-Benz cars this year due to the semiconductor scarcity. It previously said deliveries would be “significantly above” last year’s level, which was depressed by pandemic-related shutdowns.<br />The chip shortage is shaping up to be the dominant theme of yet another earnings season for the automotive industry. The current drought, which seems likely to last into next year, is a big management challenge and is leading to some unusual market share moves. At an industry level, though, it is also having beneficial side effects, as consumers pay up for the few vehicles available, often helped by easy credit terms.<br />In particular, high prices are boosting the value of car makers’ banking operations, which are exposed to residual prices through the leasing business. The adjusted return on equity in Daimler’s big financing arm was a barnstorming 24% in the second quarter, up from 8.6% in the same period last year.<br />Despite some dramatic numbers, investors have largely ignored the semiconductor problem, neither worrying much about the effect of lower-than-expected sales in what was supposed to be a recovery year, nor giving manufacturers much credit for today’s unusual levels of profitability. Daimler’s stock is up 23% this year, but it still trades at just six times earnings forecasts for this year and next—toward the bottom end of the historic range. This might be a bit cheap given Daimler’s plans to demerge its valuable heavy-truck business later this year. For the wider industry, though, discounting the current situation makes sense.</td>

      <td>Constricted supply, not overheating demand, is casting a shadow over the recovery, worrying investors</td>
      <td>There are two kinds of inflation. One results from demand growing faster than the economy’s productive capacity, causing the economy to overheat. Call that good inflation, because it is usually linked to a stronger economy. By contrast, bad inflation results from constricted supply which curtails output, driving up prices and eroding incomes, leading to a weaker economy.<br />Much of the debate over inflation is whether the good sort—i.e., overheating—is about to happen. But investors are signaling that the bad sort is the bigger risk to the economy. As measured inflation has shot to a 13-year high of 5.4%, long-term bond yields have plummeted. Even before the spreading Delta variant of Covid-19 unsettled stocks this week, more economically sensitive sectors have been flagging. Those are the sorts of market movements that precede an economic slowdown. Meanwhile, economic data has gone from solidly upbeat to mixed: Forecaster IHS Markit has revised down estimated annual growth in the second quarter from nearly 12% in early June to 8%.<br />The textbook case of bad inflation is an energy shock. The supply of oil is relatively fixed in the short run so a disruption such as a war or a surge in global demand can cause the price to rise. That can both force companies to reduce output and act as a tax on consumers. The last two times inflation was as high as it is now, in 1990 and 2008, resulted from oil shocks that helped push the U.S. into recession.<br />The U.S. is now experiencing several such supply shocks at once, collectively throwing up a roadblock to what should be a powerful post-pandemic recovery.<br />The most pronounced supply problems are in housing and autos. Both usually lead recoveries as they respond to pent-up demand and low interest rates. This time, that demand is colliding with severely constrained supply.</td>

      <td>The highly contagious Delta variant of Covid-19 doesn’t pose an immediate risk to the strength of the U.S. economic recovery, with analysts expecting a robust expansion to continue in the second half of the year.<br />Many economists are maintaining forecasts for solid economic growth due to expectations of steady hiring and continued spending, driven by accumulated savings and Americans’ desire to travel and socialize more than a year into the pandemic.<br />They see limited disruptions to the economy as local health officials try to avoid restrictions and boost vaccinations in response to the recent case surge. Economists are more concerned about firming inflation than the Delta variant as they assess the economic outlook.<br />“The variant is a significant downside risk for the economy, but that risk is more than offset by what are still very strong fundamentals,” said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “Consumers have a lot of cash and seem eager to spend on activities they couldn’t do for 18 months. And, for now, it seems like the vaccines should be able to keep the spike in cases fairly low.”<br />Oxford, a forecasting firm, hasn’t changed its projection for U.S. gross domestic product—a broad measure of the economy’s output of goods and services. It expects GDP to rise at nearly a 9% annualized pace in the third quarter. Such historically strong growth would be in line with the stimulus-fueled expansion in the first half of the year.</td>

Mr. Aron said in an April interview that he viewed the company’s individual shareholders as “my bosses. They’re who I work for.”<br />Those shareholders, many of whom needle each other on social media not to sell AMC stock despite significant price moves, served as a financial lifeline for the company as it raced to raise funds while the pandemic was jeopardizing its future.</td>

It has only closed higher this year on the last two days in March, when it peaked at 93.3.<br />The global economy has been accelerating out of Covid-19 restrictions, led by an American economy turbocharged by high government spending. In the first three months of this year, that led to a strong dollar rally from a low of 89.4 in early January to the March high.<br />Investors are now growing more concerned that the U.S. recovery is reaching a plateau. The infrastructure bill that promised the next big wave of government stimulus could also take longer to be signed into law and may be smaller than expected. At the same time, China’s economy is slowing and the highly transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus looks likely to force some countries to reverse, or at least slow, their reopening plans.<br />That is prompting caution among investors.

In the late 1970s, an average of 418,000 new units of entry-level housing were built each year, according to data from Freddie Mac. By the 2010s, that number had fallen to 55,000 new units a year. For 2020, an estimated 65,000 new entry-level homes were completed.<br />“You can really draw a straight line from the 1940s down to the most recent years, which is really striking and also very concerning,” said Sam Khater, chief economist and head of Freddie Mac’s Economic and Housing Research division.<br />Mr. Khater said he initially expected to see this drop most acutely in historically expensive metropolitan areas such as New York and San Francisco.

Over time, they have been applied to swaths of the U.S. workforce, ensnaring janitors, baristas, schoolteachers and entry-level workers along with more senior employees like software engineers, sales representatives and top executives.<br />Around 32% of U.S. companies include the clauses in all of their employment contracts regardless of position or pay, according to a survey conducted by compensation data firm PayScale Inc. in coordination with management professors. Use of noncompete clauses surged partly because templates can be found easily online and pasted into contracts, said Evan Starr, a professor at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland and one of the authors of the survey.<br />The proliferation has drawn increased attention from regulators, lawyers and researchers. Though the clauses have until now been regulated at the state level, attorneys and scholars who study competition policy expect the FTC to propose a federal rule that would outlaw noncompetes for workers below a certain income level and may impose limits on the duration or scope of the clauses. An outright ban is unlikely, experts say.</td>

People want to get out and about.”<br />Coke’s sales volume for the quarter ended July 2 grew ahead of 2019 levels in markets such as China and Brazil but trailed in India, which was battered by the pandemic this spring.

Yet Ms. Bustamante says she doesn’t feel ready to return to her pre-pandemic jaunts to the city, and she is only comfortable meeting friends there one-on-one, preferably outdoors.<br />“You look at social media, and you see some people out there having all that fun,” says the 49-year-old product-management consultant in suburban Rockland County, N.Y. “I can’t picture myself in that picture.”<br />Ever since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave the all-clear for vaccinated people to gather indoors without masks and resume pre-pandemic activities, many have eagerly returned to dining inside restaurants, attending parties and flying to see friends and family. (And plenty of people already were doing so before.) Yet for others, returning to their former lives—and much of the outside world—is proving tough after more than a year of relative isolation.</td>

      <td>The defections could complicate the New York governor’s expected re-election bid as he fights off allegations that he sexually harassed staff and mishandled the pandemic</td>
      <td>For over a decade, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has been a fundraising juggernaut, taking in more than $130 million from developers, unions, finance executives and others to build a sheen of invincibility around his governorship.<br />But Mr. Cuomo is starting to lose some of his major donors, suffering defections in recent weeks that could complicate an expected re-election bid as he fights off a state sexual harassment probe and a federal investigation into how his administration handled Covid-19 in nursing homes.<br />The desertions are a worrying sign for a governor who has sought to project strength through one of the rockiest stretches of his 11 years as governor. Mr. Cuomo raised $2.3 million over the past six months—the second-smallest haul of any such period of his governorship, according to campaign finance disclosures filed last week. For the first time, he was outraised by a Republican rival, U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin, who announced a gubernatorial bid in April.<br />Jeff Gural, a real-estate developer and casino owner who has previously given $175,000 to Mr. Cuomo’s campaigns, says he is turning his back on the Democratic governor because he doesn’t like the way he conducts business and has felt threatened to donate in the past. Mr. Gural said recent reports about the governor’s alleged harassment—which Mr. Cuomo has denied—were concerning and he was unhappy with how the state decided to legalize mobile sports betting.<br />“He’s smart, but he’s a bully and his tactics are a disgrace. And people should know how he runs the state,” Mr. Gural said.</td>

Wall Street analysts had forecast adjusted earnings of $2.29 a share and revenue of $22.49 billion, according to FactSet’s survey.</td>

The horses are purchased with digital currency and act as NFTs, which are essentially digital collectibles that hold value.<br />Zed Run takes a fee from the money users pay to virtually breed horses on the site, as well as from race entry fees and the sale of these NFTs. Individual virtual horse owners stand to make money when the value of their horses rises, attracting higher prices on Zed Run’s horse breeding market and on the horse resale market. Every race also pays prizes for first through third place finishes in Ethereum, a cryptocurrency.<br />The price of Zed’s digital racehorses range from $130 to $45,000. Whole stables, which include multiple horses, have sold for over $250,000 and owners can resell horses, the company said.</td>

The group offers services such as a mobile wallet, loans and stock-trading, and is backed by Jack Ma’s Chinese financial-technology giant Ant Group Co. One97 aims to issue new and existing shares worth a total of up to 166 billion rupees, the equivalent of $2.23 billion.<br />Other companies considering IPOs include digital-payments platform One MobiKwik Systems Ltd., which filed its prospectus earlier this month, and logistics and supply-chain-services provider Delhivery Pvt., according to a company spokeswoman. Online cosmetics seller Nykaa E-Retail Pvt., API Holdings Pvt., the parent company of online pharmacy PharmEasy, and PB Fintech Pvt., the parent of insurance aggregator Policybazaar.com, are also considering listings, according to people familiar with their plans.<br />“This is the first set of these companies coming to the public market” in India, said Kaustubh Kulkarni, the head of investment banking for India at the local unit of  JPMorgan Chase  & Co.</td>

      <td>While the IAC company lacks the ‘buzz’ of a noteworthy rival, it seems to be doing more in terms of margins</td>
      <td>You may have never heard of digital media company Dotdash, but owner  IAC/InterActiveCorp  is probably making money off you anyway.<br />Dotdash describes three types of content online: nice to know, such as what your friends are up to on social media; want to know, including current events and sports; and need to know, like whether your cough could be something more serious.<br />Dotdash specializes in the third. Its 14 brands include Investopedia, The Spruce, Brides and Simply Recipes. Ever wonder what exactly is “adjusted” about “adjusted Ebitda” or how not to shrink your laundry? Creative wedding venues? How to make lasagna for 10 people? If you have had a question online over the past several years, there is a good chance you found your answer through one of Dotdash’s brands.<br />Dotdash, formerly known as About.com, has a history that dates back to the 1990s. It was acquired by IAC almost 10 years ago. Few know the company by name, even if they recognize its individual brands. That could soon change. Dotdash is still small, comprising just 7% of IAC’s total revenue last year. But with the spinoff of Vimeo recently completed, Dotdash is now the fastest-growing and the most highly valued wholly owned asset remaining under the IAC umbrella. JPMorgan analyst Cory Carpenter estimated last month that, excluding IAC’s minority stake in MGM, its majority stake in  Angi Inc.  and cash, Dotdash now constitutes roughly 55% of its value.<br />Competitor BuzzFeed Inc.’s plans for a public listing have turned heads back to digital media after some tough years, putting Dotdash’s recent performance in a positive light. Last month BuzzFeed, whose portfolio includes such brands as HuffPost and Tasty in addition to its listicle-heavy namesake brand, said it would go public through a merger with a blank-check firm. The deal, which includes a $300 million acquisition of youth entertainment and media company Complex Networks, is being valued at $1.5 billion.</td>

JPMorgan’s shares closed at $149.71 yesterday, after rising about 18% this year.<br />“This special award reflects the board’s desire for Mr. Dimon to continue to lead the firm for a further significant number of years,” the bank said in the filing.<br />“In making the special award, the board considered the importance of Mr. Dimon’s continuing, long-term stewardship of the firm, leadership continuity, and management succession planning amid a highly competitive landscape for executive leadership talent,” the bank said.<br />Mr. Dimon, 65, has led the bank since 2005 and maintains that his retirement isn’t a near-term event. The bank’s board earlier this year indicated that it wanted him to stay on for five to seven years, people familiar with the matter have told The Wall Street Journal. The new options are in addition to his regular compensation, the bank said.</td>

Mr. Bach said the IOC wanted to “encourage Olympic projects which use a high percentage of existing and temporary venues.”<br />The Brisbane Games are tentatively set for July 23 to Aug. 8, 2032, the same dates on the calendar as this year’s Tokyo Olympics, which begin Friday.</td>

The city has offered Yumeshima or “dream island,” a man-made patch in Osaka Bay, for a casino-centered resort.<br />Osaka Gov. Hirofumi Yoshimura said Wednesday that Osaka has received a proposal from MGM and Japanese financial-services company  Orix Corp.  to spend ¥1 trillion, equivalent to about $9 billion, to build a casino resort. They are the only group pursuing such a project in Osaka.<br />While the Osaka government hasn’t officially given the consortium’s plan the go-ahead, Mr. Yoshimura hailed the proposal. “I would like to invite the world’s best integrated resort to Yumeshima where many people in Japan and abroad can come and enjoy Osaka after the pandemic is over,” Mr. Yoshimura said.</td>

      <td>New York is opening its lucrative market to mobile sports betting, but gambling companies vying to operate in the state may have to pay a steep premium for the privilege.<br />State officials issued a request for applications from sports-betting companies earlier this month, with proposals due Aug. 9.  DraftKings Inc.  and FanDuel Group, the most dominant companies in the online betting industry, are expected to submit applications to the New York State Gaming Commission in the coming weeks.<br />DraftKings Chief Executive Jason Robins said at a  Goldman Sachs  conference in June that the company is “excited and hopeful that we’ll be able to put a very competitive bid forth and be selected as one of the handful of operators in New York.” FanDuel spokesman Cory Fox said the company is excited for the opportunity to offer its services in New York and was reading the request for applications closely.<br />The state estimates mobile betting will eventually generate $482 million in annual tax revenue from a roughly $1 billion sports wagering market. But New York isn’t making it easy for gambling companies, according to people familiar with the state’s plans. Companies must offer to pay the state at least 50% of their revenues, which some say could reach 60% to 65% in the competitive process.<br />New York State Budget Director Robert Mujica, a fiscal adviser to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, said the state expects major industry players will apply. “New York is a massive market,” Mr. Mujica said. “One way or another, providers will participate, so we think they’ll put their best foot forward.”</td>

But if Mr. Biden decides he would prefer his own pick, rather than the Republican chosen by President Trump, Fed governor Lael Brainard is the most likely candidate to succeed him.<br />“The president will engage with his senior economic team in a careful and thoughtful process to appoint a Federal Reserve chair in a timely manner,” a White House official said.<br />The White House declined to comment on specific names that may be under consideration both for Fed chair and other vacancies on the seven-member board of governors. “The president will appoint the candidates who he thinks will be the most effective in managing monetary policy,” the White House official said.<br />Administration officials said Mr. Biden will consult with his top economic advisers, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Council of Economic Advisers Chair Cecilia Rouse and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese, to discuss the coming pick. White House chief of staff Ron Klain is likely to play a leading role overseeing the search.</td>

Copia will focus on developing large-scale solar generation projects and battery facilities to store power and distribute it after sunset.<br />Carlyle has a long history of debt and equity investments in fossil fuels, but now the firm—and competitors like  Blackstone Group Inc.  and  KKR  & Co.—is pivoting to cleaner technologies. The money manager in April disclosed $22 billion of private-equity investments in traditional and renewable energy, representing 16% of total private-equity assets under management.<br />The initiative is part of a race on Wall Street, as large investment firms bankroll competing power projects amid a national pushto revamp electrical infrastructure. The shift comes as investors clamor for environmentally friendly financial products and as national infrastructure initiatives offer potential opportunities to private-equity firms.<br />“There is a recognition by these companies that this is a new asset class and that there’s an enormous amount of development prospects out there,” said Jason Burwen, interim chief executive of the U.S. Energy Storage Association trade group. “It’s a good time to be a capital provider.”</td>

      <td>Home buyers during the pandemic have been willing to take on long commutes in exchange for lower prices, a new analysis shows.<br />In some of the nation’s most expensive metro areas, home prices rose faster in areas with longer morning commutes to business districts compared with neighborhoods with short commutes, according to an analysis from  Zillow Group Inc.<br />That is a reversal from prior years, when home prices in those metro areas accelerated faster in neighborhoods close to job centers.<br />Analysts say the change reflects that commute length has declined in importance for home buyers, as many workers expect to travel to their offices less often going forward. At the same time, rapidly rising prices have made affordability a bigger concern for many buyers.<br />“It’s been a big change,” said Ed Pinto, director of the AEI Housing Center at the American Enterprise Institute, who expects the shift in home-buyer demand to be long-lasting. “There’s a huge group of people who can work from home, and they’ll continue to work from home when things go back to…normal.”</td>

At the same time, many investors think inflation readings may run hot for some period, then subside on their own or lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and slow the recovery.<br />The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note settled Tuesday at 1.208%, according to  Tradeweb ,  up slightly from Monday but still down from 1.3% Friday and its 2021 high of 1.749% set in March.<br />Yields, which rise when bond prices fall, climbed sharply earlier in the year, lifted by bets that the U.S. economy would reach full employment with remarkable speed because of a vaccine-fueled recovery juiced by large-scale government spending.<br />Adding to the rise were signals from Fed officials that they would hold off raising interest rates until after inflation climbed above their 2% target for a sustained period. That bolstered investors’ confidence that the Fed would let the economy run hot, creating sustained inflation that the central bank could later control with well-timed rate increases.</td>

The advance almost unwound the S&P 500’s steep drop from Monday and pushed the index to within 1.5% of its record closing high.<br />Contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 0.6% Wednesday, suggesting that the blue-chips index will add to its rebound at the open and inch closer to its all-time high. Futures on the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 edged up 0.2%.<br />Investors are putting concerns about the economic effects of the Delta variant to one side, though markets are expected to remain jittery heading into the peak summer vacation period. A banner start to the earnings season among the biggest U.S. companies is helping buoy sentiment. Many money managers also see few other places to deploy cash with yields on government and corporate bonds trading at depressed levels.<br />“The market is facing a genuine test: whether the link between case rises and hospitalizations is broken,” said Peter van der Welle, a multiasset strategist at Robeco. Nonetheless, Mr. van der Welle expects a second leg of the reopening trade—in which bond yields, economically sensitive stocks and commodities all rose—to get under way once there is more clarity about the Delta variant.</td>

      <td>Energy strategy proposes doubling renewable energy, slashing fossil fuels’ share of power grid to less than half over the next decade</td>
      <td>Japan is proposing to double the share of solar and other renewable energy in its power grid and slash the share of fossil fuels to less than half during the next decade, as the world’s third-largest economy becomes the latest to unveil ambitious plans to remake its energy system.<br />The targets appear in a draft of Japan’s latest national energy strategy unveiled Wednesday. They incorporate a huge jump in carbon-cutting goals, reflecting an increased international sense of urgency around climate change. The draft calls for an ambitious reboot of Japan’s nuclear fleet—the bulk of which is still offline after the country’s nuclear meltdowns in 2011. It also proposes building a hydrogen supply chain and includes the fuel for the first time in its proposed energy mix.<br />But experts say the plan will be extremely tough to execute by its deadline of 2030. And the persistence in the proposed energy mix of a significant amount of coal—the worst carbon emitter of the fossil fuels—highlights the challenges Japan and many other countries, especially in Asia, will have in transforming their energy systems.<br />Although the goals themselves are laudable, “this is a problematic (energy) mix in many ways,” says Takeo Kikkawa, a vice president of the International University of Japan and a member of the advisory committee that consulted on the energy strategy.<br />Japan has little chance of hitting its renewable and nuclear-energy targets and set its fossil-fuel targets dangerously low, he says.</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—Assets under management at Ant Group Co.’s highly popular money-market fund fell to their lowest level in years after pressure from China’s regulators forced the company to sit out an industrywide boom.<br />Data for the second quarter, released Wednesday, showed that the Tianhong Yu’e Bao money-market fund had the equivalent of $120.4 billion of assets at the end of June, down 20% percent from three months earlier to a level last seen in late 2016. Last autumn, before Chinese regulators forced Ant to call off its blockbuster initial public offering, the giant fund had more than $180 billion in assets under management.<br />Chinese billionaire Jack Ma’s Ant is the majority shareholder in Tianhong Asset Management, the company that manages the eight-year-old mutual fund. The name of the fund means “leftover treasure,” and it is sold on Ant’s ubiquitous Alipay app. Close to half of China’s population was invested in it at the end of 2020, and many have stashed money in their digital wallets in the money-market fund to earn income before spending it.<br />At its peak in early 2018, the fund managed assets totaling 1.69 trillion yuan, the equivalent of $260.6 billion at present exchange rates, and was the largest such vehicle in the world. It used to produce returns far in excess of Chinese bank deposit rates by buying bank certificates of deposit and other higher-yielding products. Its rapid growth and large size drew regulatory scrutiny at the time, leading Ant to  impose investment caps and open up its Yu’e Bao money-market investing platform to rival products.<br />The caps were subsequently scrapped after the giant fund started shrinking and losing investors to other funds.</td>

      <td>Streaming giant confirms interest in videogames as subscriber growth remains mired in post-pandemic slump</td>
      <td>It is as good a time as any for  Netflix  to test a new story line. Even a lucky turn in videogames won’t free the streaming giant from the need to keep playing Hollywood’s game, though.<br />Netflix used its second-quarter report Tuesday afternoon to confirm previously reported plans to enter the videogame business. No timing was given, though the company said the offerings would be included in its current subscription plans at no additional cost. The company isn’t backing away from its work on movies and TV shows, but said in its letter to shareholders “since we are nearly a decade into our push into original programming, we think the time is right to learn more about how our members value games.”<br />That news comes as Netflix remains mired in somewhat of a post-pandemic slump. It added 1.5 million net new paying subscribers in the second quarter, which was a bit better than it had forecast but still its lowest level of growth in nearly a decade. It also projected 3.5 million net adds for the third quarter—about 29% less than what Wall Street was hoping for. That would bring the total number of new subscribers to about nine million for the first nine months of 2021. Netflix added more than 28 million paying subscribers in the same period last year.<br />A foray into games might make sense for a company with an intimate knowledge of the viewing habits of a user base that now numbers over 209 million. It is also a tough business to crack—even the mobile gaming market that Netflix says it expects to target initially. There are many participants, but most of the money is still made by long-established properties. Games like “Candy Crush” and “Clash of Clans” remain in the top-five grossing charts even after nearly a decade on the market.<br />Netflix will need to keep battling it out for video streaming eyeballs. The company expects its pace of new releases to pick up in the second half of this year; analysts from Wedbush count 42 original shows and movies expected for the third quarter alone. But the company still has its own track record to compete with: Last fall included popular shows such as “The Queen’s Gambit,” “The Crown” and “Bridgerton.” Netflix shares are down nearly 2% this year, lagging behind many internet and entertainment peers. Streaming investors hyper-focused on subscriber growth aren’t playing games.</td>

      <td>The richest man on Earth briefly lost that title Tuesday morning, but only because for a few floaty minutes he was no longer on Earth. Jeff Bezos has spent two decades using his  Amazon  wealth to underwrite a rocket venture, Blue Origin. On Tuesday the company launched its first manned flight to space, with Mr. Bezos strapped on board the capsule.<br />After riding the New Shepard rocket to Mach 3, experiencing weightlessness, and parachuting back to the Texas desert, Mr. Bezos thanked the engineers and crew, along with “every Amazon employee and every Amazon customer, because you guys paid for all this.”<br />It’s easy to dismiss this as a joy ride, which in part it was, or as the indulgence of a rich man with attention-deficit disorder. But as billionaires’ hobbies go, this is more productive than, well, owning the Washington Post. “The architecture and the technology we have chosen,” Mr. Bezos said, “is complete overkill for a suborbital tourism mission.” That’s because the mission isn’t limited to expensive thrills.<br />Tourism is merely the first rung of the space ladder. Blue Origin has two more manned flights on the schedule for this year, and Mr. Bezos said the company is approaching $100 million in private sales. Virgin Galactic has presold hundreds of tickets for its space plane, which flew its founder, Richard Branson, to weightlessness last week. Elon Musk’s SpaceX has ferried NASA astronauts to orbit, but it has private flights on the calendar, too.<br />It isn’t clear how big this tourism market will be, but the competition is clearly on, as Blue Origin brags that its capsule has bigger windows than the other guy’s. As these companies strive to outdo each other, costs will fall. Engineering advances, such as reusable rockets that land vertically, have already slashed the price of getting cargo to space.</td>

      <td>Democrats have provided few details of what they plan to include in Sen. Bernie Sanders’s $3.5 trillion budget proposal, and now we know why. The real cost is $5 trillion or more, according to an independent analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which keeps an eye on fiscal matters.<br />The budget-resolution fact sheet Democrats circulated last week includes only a bare-bones description of the bill’s major programs for tax credits, new entitlements, healthcare, climate and housing. Some categories include this revealing caveat: “The duration of each program’s enactment will be determined based on scoring and Committee input.”<br />That’s Washington-speak for admitting the budget will be built on phony assumptions and gimmicks. Democrats know their proposed tax hikes and dubious “pay-fors” won’t come close to fully funding “every major program that President Biden has asked us for”—as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer claimed.<br />Their plan is to include every program but start small and pretend they’re temporary. This will let them skirt the budget-reconciliation rule that spending can’t add to the deficit outside a 10-year budget window without triggering a 60-vote threshold to pass.<br />The nonprofit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget examined the budget outline and on Monday released a more honest analysis of the bill’s cost. Its estimate is based on Joe Biden’s fiscal 2022 budget proposal and legislation that Democrats have already proposed that will fill in the budget blanks later this year. Assuming the major provisions will be made permanent and continue through the 10-year budget window, the group says, the “policies under consideration could cost between $5 trillion and $5.5 trillion over a decade.”</td>

The Trump Administration fixed it with a proper rule-making. But here we go again as President Biden has nominated the same woman for the same job to impose the same standard of injustice.<br />The woman is Catherine Lhamon, who is Mr. Biden’s nominee to be assistant secretary for civil rights in the Education Department. That’s the same job she held in the Obama years, when she was the top enforcer of Title IX guidance for colleges. Because “a Title IX investigation will never result in incarceration of an individual,” Ms. Lhamon’s office told colleges in a 2014 Q&A, “the same procedural protections and legal standards” that govern criminal proceedings “are not required.” Tell that to a young person whose life can be permanently scarred by a false accusation.<br />Her directive “strongly” discouraged “a school from allowing the parties to personally question or cross-examine each other during a hearing on alleged sexual violence” because it “may be traumatic or intimidating” for the victim. The standard of guilt for the accused was merely a preponderance of evidence. Several accused students sued in federal court, and more than one judge faulted schools for lack of due process under the Obama guidance.<br />Betsy DeVos, the Trump education secretary, sought to restore some basic fairness to Title IX cases. Her rule in 2020, issued after ample time for public comment, included such due-process protections as the right of both parties to cross-examine witnesses and present and challenge evidence.<br />Ms. Lhamon claimed on  Twitter  at the time that the DeVos rule was a return “to the bad old days, that predate my birth, when it was permissible to rape and sexually harass students with impunity.” That was false even in the “bad old days,” and it’s false about the DeVos rule. But Ms. Lhamon was unapologetic in her Senate confirmation hearing. It’s a safe bet that, if confirmed, Ms. Lhamon would roll back the due process protections.</td>

      <td>The Bay Colonists thought salvation could be earned through good works. Anne Hutchinson loudly disagreed. Trouble ensued.</td>
      <td>How did a dispute within a small breakaway group of Protestants over a seemingly obscure point of theology become an iconic episode in American history? The issue was whether one could earn eternal salvation through godly behavior, or whether the gift of saving grace is bestowed without regard to a person’s conduct. To the side led by Anne Hutchinson, the difference was between a popish “covenant of works” and a true “covenant of grace.” To the other, headed by John Winthrop, “free grace” portended “antinomianism,” a world of free love and social disorder in which the laws of church and state did not apply to true believers.<br />The protagonists, as Marilyn J. Westerkamp shows in “The Passion of Anne Hutchinson,” (Oxford, 312 pages, $29.95) were worthy adversaries. Winthrop, the leader of the Great Puritan Migration to Massachusetts Bay, was the colony’s frequent governor and the man whose vision of a “city upon a hill” became the stuff of presidential speeches. Hutchinson (1591–1643), the daughter of a dissenting minister, was a charismatic matron with a reputation for piety. Caught in the middle was the Rev. John Cotton, a Cambridge-educated divine with a foot in each camp. Resonating through the centuries, the controversy plays out in the parties’ own voices in diaries and trial transcripts.<br />Hutchinson herself speaks to the modern interest in women’s history. Called by the scholar Michael Winship “the most famous—or infamous—English woman in colonial American history,” she has been cast as a martyr for religious freedom, a victim of the patriarchy, or a sacrifice to social order at a time when Massachusetts was threatened by belligerent Native Americans and a hostile Crown. She was a prophet, a Jezebel or both.<br />Hutchinson arrived in Boston, age 43, in September 1634, on board the same ship that a year earlier had brought her adored pastor, John Cotton, to the New World. Accompanying her was her husband, William, a successful cloth merchant, 10 of their 11 surviving children, and a handful of relatives and servants. The Hutchinsons joined their eldest son, who had already crossed the Atlantic with Cotton. Among the wealthiest émigrés, they received a house lot across the street from Winthrop, grazing rights on Taylor’s Island in the middle of Boston Harbor, and 600 acres of farmland near what later became Quincy. William soon became a town selectman and a member of the General Court. Anne became a sought-after midwife and herbalist, known for edifying religious counsel in the birthing room.<br />By 1636, Anne was holding weekly prayer meetings for women in her home. At first, the gatherings followed the English custom of female “conventicles,” but as Anne’s fame spread her constituency broadened to include men. Eventually Hutchinson presided over two “public lectures” each week, attended by 60 to 80 followers. Her message—an increasingly strident condemnation of all the local clergy except Cotton—only exacerbated her challenge to the standing order.</td>

      <td>Americans haven’t wanted to understand what it means for a virus to be endemic.</td>
      <td>The difficulty of the news business is that you’re constantly trying to tell people their information is outmoded, which they resist since assimilating new information entails a cost. And yet here goes:<br />If you haven’t had Covid yet, you will. If you’ve had it once, you’ll have it again. If you’re vaccinated or were infected previously—which will one day be most people except the very young—your symptoms will likely be mild or nonexistent, but it’s not guaranteed. Words the CDC says about the flu it will say about Covid: “Vaccination is especially important for people 65 years and older because they are at high risk of developing serious complications from flu. Flu vaccines are updated each season as needed to keep up with changing viruses.”<br />Nobody is surprised when they get the flu for the second, the third, the eighth time in their lives. This is what epidemiologists meant when, for the last 15 months, they said the new coronavirus was likely to evolve and become endemic.<br />Which brings us again to the question of vaccine hesitancy. Media types have been worshiping a Kaiser Family Foundation survey that finds 86% of Democrats and only 52% of Republicans are vaccinated.<br />But all the problems of polling apply: fewer and increasingly unrepresentative are those of us who even bother to answer our phones; we’re cagey on partisan questions. The numbers also seem disproportionate to every correlate: Rural vs. urban. Young vs. old. Black vs. white. Kaiser says it aims for an error of plus or minus 3 percentage points; on party identification it achieved an error of 6 to 7 points.</td>

      <td>The Fed should pay attention to Milton Friedman’s wisdom.</td>
      <td>June’s inflation index jumped 5.4% from a year ago, the highest reading since August 2008. The experts were surprised. Clearly, Federal Reserve watchers never bothered to consult Milton Friedman. Lost is a core Friedman dictum: “Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.”<br />In his Feb. 23 testimony to Congress, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the growth in the money supply, specifically M2, “doesn’t really have important implications.” The experts, the press and the bond vigilantes were as quick to unlearn monetarism, if they ever had learned it, as Mr. Powell. Reporting about U.S. inflation rarely contains the words “money supply.” We are repeatedly told that the most recent upticks in inflation are anomalous and “transitory.”<br />Wrong. The inflation upticks aren’t temporary and were predictable, driven by an extraordinary explosion in the money supply. Since March 2020, the M2 has been growing at an average annualized rate of 23.9%—the fastest since World War II. There is so much money out there that banks don’t know what to do with it. Via reverse repurchase agreements, banks and money-market funds are lending money to the Fed to the tune of $860 billion. That’s unprecedented.<br />According to monetarism, asset-price inflation should have occurred with a lag of one to nine months. Then, with a lag of six to 18 months, economic activity should have started to pick up. Lastly, after a lag of 12 to 24 months, generalized inflation should have set in. That’s the standard monetarist sequence, and it’s been followed to a T.<br />To get a handle on what the recent money supply explosion implies for inflation, consider a monetarist model for determining national income. That famous model was displayed on Milton Friedman’s California license plates. It’s compact: MV=Py, where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money (the speed at which it circulates), P is the price level, and y is real gross domestic product.</td>

      <td>The U.S. ‘doesn’t hide from our shortcomings.’ But we shouldn’t further authoritarian propaganda.</td>
      <td>The “Spring Festival Gala” is a nationwide television event in China, broadcast annually the eve of the lunar new year. The Economist magazine describes the show as “the most-watched television programme on Earth” and “one of the most vetted by the authorities.” The Communist Party reviews and approves everything in it.<br />In 2018, according to the Economist, the gala included a skit featuring a Chinese actress “in blackface and African dress, with exaggerated fake buttocks and a bowl of fruit on her head. For no clear reason, she had in tow a blackfaced Chinese man dressed as a monkey.”<br />Derogatory depictions of blacks that became taboo in the West generations ago remain commonplace in today’s China. A few years back, a horrified reader sent me a video of a Chinese commercial for laundry detergent. It featured a Chinese woman placing a detergent pod in the mouth of a black man and then shoving him into a washing machine. At the end of the cycle, a “clean” Asian man appears. The commercial had been appearing for months in China without incident until outraged viewers in the English-speaking world saw it and the video went viral. Within the country, however, “mostly the ad was met with apathy, perhaps because there is limited public debate about racism in China,” wrote Emma Graham-Harrison in the Guardian newspaper.<br />If these episodes shock the sensibilities of most people in the U.S., they haven’t deterred the Biden administration from tapping the likes of China to lecture Americans on our racial progress. Last week Secretary of State Antony Blinken invited officials from the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “systemic racism” in the U.S. This would be the same Human Rights Council whose membership includes not only China but also Russia and Cuba. Remarking on the decision, Mr. Blinken said that the U.S. doesn’t “hide from our shortcomings” and that this move will help “confront the scourge of racism, racial discrimination, and xenophobia.” If only.<br />These countries are not interested in any honest or objective scrutiny of America’s record on race—our Civil War to end slavery, our civil-rights movement to end Jim Crow, or how we twice elected a black man as president of a country that remains overwhelmingly white. It doesn’t matter to them that black Americans are far more prosperous than other black people. Or that, whatever our faults, very few blacks (or other racial and ethnic minorities) are trying to leave the U.S., while untold millions still want to migrate here.</td>

      <td>There will be dangerous consequences if Biden doesn’t respond strongly to the kidnapping plot.</td>
      <td>The foiled kidnapping plot against activist and journalist Masih Alinejad, an Iranian-born U.S. citizen living in New York City, has sparked a wave of outrage. The Justice Department’s indictment and detailed court documents indicate the Islamic Republic’s significant investment in the plot. The most troublesome part of this case, however, has been the Biden administration’s weak public response, which invites more malign behavior from Tehran.<br />Hundreds of dissidents have been threatened, kidnapped or assassinated since 1979, when the current regime rose to power in Iran. Since 2018, however, the Islamic Republic has carried out its campaign of terror with a new fervor. In 2019, Tehran lured, kidnapped and killed Ruhollah Zam, an Iranian dissident journalist residing in France. In July 2020, the Islamic Republic abducted Jamshid Sharmahd in Dubai and brought him to Iran, where he has been detained ever since. Mr. Sharmad is a lawful permanent resident of the U.S. The regime also abducted Habib Chaab, an Iranian-Swedish political activist, in October 2020.<br />Like other Iranian activists, the Brooklyn-based Ms. Alinejad has long faced threats for her opposition to the clerical regime. But attacking a U.S. citizen on American soil is something the Islamic Republic hasn’t attempted in more than four decades. Why now?<br />Iran, pressed to show its strength by the tide of discontent rising among its restive population, is likely taking these actions to send two messages. The first is to the Iranian people: No matter where you flee to, if you speak up, we will find you. This is at a time when antiregime protests are erupting in the country. The second and more important is meant for the U.S.: We will come after your people on your soil, spreading terror and brutality in the belief that, as the regime’s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, put it, “America can’t do a damn thing against us.”<br />So far, President Biden has proved Khomeini prescient. His cowed stance is dangerous not only for those residing within the U.S. but for liberty’s advocates all around the world. The plot to kidnap an American citizen from New York has thus far gone unrecognized and uncondemned by Mr. Biden. The one tweet that did come from Secretary of State Antony Blinken didn’t even name Iran as the perpetrator or mention that an American citizen had been threatened on U.S. soil.</td>

      <td>‘The draconian rule, harsh punishments, and resulting climate of fear within Cuba by the source of the quote, cannot be diminished.’</td>
      <td>From a statement posted July 19 by the public-relations Instagram account of Penn State University, where a wall featured a quote from Fidel Castro:<br /><br />The Paul Robeson Cultural Center provides programs and support services to encourage and cultivate the appreciation and celebration of diverse perspectives, experiences and cultures. The Center seeks to make true the mission of the institution by serving students in the development of character, conscience, and social responsibility through racial identity development, cultural enrichment, social justice, and inclusion. . . .<br />The quote in question was chosen in concert with our Student Liaisons Advisory Board in early 2018. The Board, comprised of one representative (and one alternate) from each of the nine student organizations housed in the center and other invited cultural student organizations on campus, provides the PRCC senior staff with feedback on center programs and initiatives, insight on current campus/student issues, and serves as an assessment group to garner input for future program ideas and initiatives. While the quote was chosen for its recognition of and direction toward social progress, the draconian rule, harsh punishments, and resulting climate of fear within Cuba by the source of the quote, cannot be diminished. As our staff work toward critical reflection with our students, analyze social movements, and encourage freedom of thought, we too must be critical of ourselves and those we raise up. We must avoid actions that create an unwelcoming atmosphere in our space or our programs. For that reason, the quote has been removed and we will continue to work with our student liaisons and the tri-Caucus’ to identify a quote which expresses our intended messages of equity and justice.<br />We welcome conversations with those students impacted by this quote and will implement new processes to gather and engage community input regarding our facility, programs, and community engagement. The work of our Center is never done and forever evolves, and so must we.</td>

      <td>A show at the Morgan Library & Museum explores the efforts by the Pakistani-American artist to bring the aesthetic of centuries-old Indo-Persian manuscripts into dialogue with contemporary art and Western art history.</td>
      <td>New York<br />In 1989, Shahzia Sikander enrolled in the illuminated manuscript painting course at the National College of Arts in Lahore, Pakistan, her native city. The discipline was considered hopelessly outmoded, even stifling to creativity, but the 20-year-old aspiring young artist thought it offered possibilities. She mastered the tradition’s complex paper preparation, meticulous techniqueand conventions of representation, and employed and subverted them all in her thesis project, “The Scroll” (1989-90), five-plus feet of fractured, gorgeously patterned, obsessively detailed interiors informed equally by 16th- and 17th-century Safavid miniatures and by Cubism. The home is presented as the expected sphere for a Pakistani woman. In handsomely furnished rooms, servants crouch, sweep, wash floors, and prepare and present foodwhile the family relaxes. A young girl dressed in white appears multiple times, sometimes transparent and ghostly, always turned away. On the far right, she paints a portrait of an identical white-clad figure who poses in profile, her dark hair nearly obscuring her featureless face.<br />“The Scroll” is among the first images we encounter in “Shahzia Sikander: Extraordinary Realities,” a retrospective survey organized by the Rhode Island School of Design Museum and on view through Sept. 26 at New York’s Morgan Library & Museum. It announces the approach and many of the dominant themes that Ms. Sikander would continue to explore: perceptions of women, self-portraits, contemporary life and its inequities, the mythological and the fantastic—exquisitely rendered and filtered through snatches of Eastern and Western traditional art. As we move ahead to work made when Ms. Sikander pursued an MFA at RISD, followed by a residency at the Glassell School of Art at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, between 1995 and 1997, we witness her experiments with a looser touch and bolder scale, and her development of a lexicon of ambiguous, anthropomorphic signs and symbols.<br />Paint becomes increasingly physical as Ms. Sikander’s work matures, enriching the rigorously clean surfaces of traditional miniature painting and sometimes canceling out fragile drawing. Carefully rendered images based on Safavid and Mughal prototypes are veiled by translucent watercolor, while tremulous, cascading lines of white paint suggest veils, imprisonment and more, triggering thoughts about restrictive societies and East/West conflicts. In “Who’s Veiled Anyway?” (1997), a polo player riding through a stylized landscape is almost obscured by a cage/veil of white lines. Ms. Sikander fragments figures, defies logical orientation and rational scale, provocatively forcing conflicting visual languages associated with different times and cultures to coexist in mysterious, loaded images, sometimes dissecting historical narratives for her own purposes. She turns the curling hair of the Gopis, the milkmaids devoted to Krishna, into a repeated floating glyph, for example.<br />Works such as the pale, luminous “Intimacy” (2001) are like supercharged art-history lessons. A nude Venus, precariously balanced on an antelope, seems to have ridden in from Bronzino’s 16th-century allegory “Venus, Cupid, Folly, and Time,” in London’s National Gallery. She reaches up to embrace a voluptuous Indian female deity, minimally outlined, while a sari-clad figure looks on, aided by a headless classicizing nude. Sinister birds, schematic architecture, hints of pattern, repeated dots and a wealth of delicate painting incidents keep us off balance, conjuring up different time periods, cultures, allusions and conceptions of what a painting can be. We’ve met the embracing women previously, in Sikander’s “Promiscuous Intimacies” (2020), a large patinated bronze sculpture outside the entrance to the show. Confronted by the painting, we realize how crucial Ms. Sikander’s hand and intimate scale are to the resonance of the image.</td>
