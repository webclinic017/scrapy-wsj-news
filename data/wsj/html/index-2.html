The case concerns the night of Aug. 25, 2020: Mr. Rittenhouse shot and killed two men and wounded another as he patrolled the city with a rifle and a small medical kit amid unrest after the police shooting of Jacob Blake.<br />Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed the misdemeanor charge of possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 17 years old. The defense had argued a person of that age could carry such a weapon under Wisconsin law as long as it wasn’t a short-barreled rifle. After the prosecution conceded that the AR-15-style rifle didn’t have a short barrel, Judge Schroeder dropped the charge. The judge also agreed to allow prosecutors to offer jurors a number of less serious charges to consider if they can’t agree on the more serious charges.</td>

But we know that illegal immigration has become a top concern of voters, and the amnesty provisions that Democrats want included in their Build Back Better reconciliation bill are unlikely to help matters.<br />Anxiety about illegal immigration typically increases during economic downturns, when foreign workers get blamed for unemployment. That’s obviously not the situation today. The economy is not in recession, and the number of available jobs far exceeds the number of people looking for work, even as employers have increased pay and offered signing bonuses to attract new employees. The current concern about illegal immigration has less to do with the labor market and more to do with the hundreds of thousands of people entering the country illegally while Biden administration officials play down the crisis or sit on their hands.</td>

      <td>The Federal Reserve’s latest policy statement reveals a dogged determination to accommodate despite increasing evidence of economic recovery, strong demand for labor and rising inflation. Chairman Jerome Powell seems eager to urge patience on raising interest rates for the sake of increasing labor participation. This approach reflects lessons learned about economic growth during the Trump administration, but changed conditions render it inappropriate for the current moment.<br />It isn’t that the framework is faulty. To the contrary, it incorporates the realization that low unemployment combined with productivity gains isn’t inflationary because it results in increased output. This contradicts the Phillips-curve notion that low unemployment leads to high inflation—which central banks must then counter by raising interest rates.</td>

Grant at Virginia’s Appomattox Court House on Palm Sunday, April 9, 1865, the flames fanning the Civil War were extinguished—so the story goes—as abruptly as if turned off by a switch. Offered generous terms to abandon their rebellion, Lee’s soldiers supposedly stacked rifles meekly and returned to civilian life, never again to take up arms against their country.<br />But as America’s sloppy withdrawal from Afghanistan recently reminded us, the final days and weeks of war, and the large-scale evacuations that invariably follow, are seldom, if ever, orderly. There were always problems with the rosy myths about Appomattox and its aftermath, not least among them the fact that ex-Confederates soon undertook a second civil war, against Reconstruction in general and African-Americans in particular.</td>

He was accused of using fraudulent means to obtain thousands of internet protocol, or IP, addresses from the American Registry for Internet Numbers, a small Virginia-based nonprofit that allocates the addresses that computers use to communicate online.</td>

      <td>Tom Donahue’s documentary looks at the enigmatic entertainer and the mercurial nature of what ‘cool’ means.</td>
      <td>People of a certain age—boomers and their elders, specifically—probably never imagined a time when they would have to explain Dean Martin. He seemed to be everywhere. He had an enormously successful run with a TV variety show, as well as hit records, club dates and movies. Just as important, he was a kind of one-man brand: the singer who wasn’t quite Sinatra, the host who wasn’t quite Carson, the actor who didn’t pretend to be Brando but who was so effortlessly charming he could make even his muffed lines into comedy material.<br />As its title implies, director Tom Donahue’s “Dean Martin: King of Cool” (with no apologies to Miles Davis) is out to define not just Martin but the quality of “cool” itself, at least in its postwar, Eisenhower-to-Kennedy-era sense. That the actor Jon Hamm is among those interviewed by Mr. Donahue is fitting; “Mad Men” helped make ’60s cool cool once more. Observers ranging from rapper/entrepreneur RZA to the cultural critic and academic Gerald Early weigh in on Martin’s contributions to, among other things, civil rights, however tangential they might have been: Martin was a member of the vaunted Rat Pack, as was Sammy Davis Jr., even though Davis couldn’t eat in certain Las Vegas hotels where he and his singing, dancing, joke-cracking white cronies performed. Martin was a Midwesterner, born in Steubenville, Ohio, in 1917 as Dino Crocetti, a second-generation Italian-American who didn’t speak English until he went to school. He didn’t make sense as the smoothest guy in show biz. “King of Cool” suggests he knew that all too well.</td>

      <td>Young people are put through their paces as they train to be dog handlers, eying a coveted spot at the Westminster Dog Show.</td>
      <td>‘The Mighty Underdogs” might make one think, however fleetingly, of a junior edition “Best in Show,” Christopher Guest’s wonderfully snarky 2000 comedy about dog shows, dogs and dog-show people. But the Discovery series is more akin to “Spellbound,” the 2002 film about the national spelling bee that spawned an entire school of documentaries, ones in which a director will focus on a specialized pursuit, the charming children and less-charming parents involved, and rolls the dice about which subjects will win both hearts and the game.<br />Like “Spellbound” and its kin—which includes every kid version of a competitive reality show—“The Mighty Underdogs” is much more about the people than the contest, or even the dogs, which are upstanding, hardworking and would seem to have fewer issues than the young people learning to handle them. It’s a fiercely competitive arena—thousands of kids try to win the requisite number of qualifying competitions to reach the Westminster Dog Show, but only a fraction do. Their motivations for competing may vary (“My therapist suggested it,” says one) but they’re generally likeable, with stories to tell and much to learn. Which they do. So do we.</td>
