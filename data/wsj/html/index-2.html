      <td>Senators are hoping to strike deal on how to pay for the legislation, which includes $600 billion in new spending</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Lawmakers sparred Monday over Senate Democrats’ decision to impose a midweek deadline on a bipartisan group still scrambling to reach an agreement on a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill.<br />Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said last week he planned to set up a vote Wednesday opening debate on the infrastructure bill. But the bipartisan group of 22 senators hasn’t yet struck a deal on how to fully pay for the cost of the legislation, which would spend roughly $600 billion above projected federal spending on improvements to roads, bridges and broadband access, among others.<br />Over the weekend, the group agreed to remove a source of revenue disliked by Republicans that would strengthen the Internal Revenue Service’s collection of unpaid taxes. That left lawmakers racing to find another way to offset the bill’s cost and complete its text.<br />“There was a little movement in the wrong direction when it came to pay-fors,” Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas), a member of Senate GOP leadership, told reporters Monday. “There’s a bipartisan desire for us to do a real infrastructure bill that’s responsibly paid for,” he said. “The problem is they haven’t been able to do it on Sen. Schumer’s timeline.”<br />Lawmakers said Monday they weren’t sure what would happen if there wasn’t enough support Wednesday to begin debate on the infrastructure bill. Republicans have said they wouldn’t vote to start debate Wednesday unless an agreement largely has been fleshed out.</td>

      <td>The Delta variant spooks markets, but the vaccines work even if the virus won’t go away.</td>
      <td>Will the pandemic ever end? That’s what investors asked Monday as they sold off stocks and rushed into bonds on fears that Covid-19’s Delta variant will slow the economic recovery or lead to more lockdowns. Let’s hope the political class has learned some lessons from the last 18 months—namely, that Covid will always be with us, and that we have to live with it without shutting down the economy.<br />New Covid uncertainty and political angst explains the 2.1% drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Value stocks tied to the reopening such as airlines, hospitality and energy companies took the biggest hits. Companies that have benefited from lockdowns were less affected.  Etsy ,  which has made a niche market selling hand-made masks, rose 3.2%.<br />The Delta variant is estimated to be more than twice as transmissible as the original Covid strain that emerged from Wuhan. Australia reports that several people were infected after “fleeting” contacts in a shopping mall. U.S. Covid cases have tripled in a month, as states lifted restrictions and travel rebounded. In the U.K., which has among the highest vaccination rates in the world, cases are approaching their winter peak.<br />Previously infected individuals appear to be more susceptible to re-infection by the Delta variant, which could explain some of the rising cases. The  Pfizer  vaccine is also estimated to be 10% to 30% less effective at preventing symptomatic illness, which means more infections among the vaccinated. Chinese vaccines appear to be less effective, and many developing countries that took the Chinese shots are administering booster shots by Western manufacturers.<br />But none of this is cause for Covid panic or more lockdowns. Vaccines are still highly effective at preventing severe illness, which is why hospitalizations in the U.K. have increased much less than cases. Some 99% of hospitalized Americans now are among the unvaccinated. Most vaccinated people with new infections—such as the five Texas Democratic state lawmakers who fled to Washington, D.C., last week—experience cold-like symptoms.</td>

      <td>The once-secret report, now public, is a warning for a derelict Congress.</td>
      <td>The Trump Administration never released its much-mooted 116-page argument for “national security” tariffs on  Volkswagen s and other foreign cars, and now we know why. Credit to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo for finally publishing it this month and letting the public see the shoddy handiwork.<br />President Trump ultimately didn’t impose the suggested tariffs of up to 35% on foreign autos, but the report is a warning of how much trade power Congress has ceded. A law known as Section 232 lets the President “adjust” imports if they threaten to impair “national security.” The autos report defines that expansively to include not only “national defense,” but also “the general security and welfare of certain industries” that are believed “critical.”<br />Hence the absurdity. The autos report cites data from 2017, and that year the world’s biggest car maker was  General Motors ,  which produced 8.9 million vehicles, including two million made in the U.S. The fourth-largest was  Ford ,  which made 6.1 million automobiles, 2.4 million in the U.S.<br />The report also claims that under Section 232 it doesn’t matter whether the purportedly perilous imports come from staunch American allies—which they do. The No. 2 and 3 auto manufacturers in 2017 were Toyota and Volkswagen. In Toyota’s case, its facilities inside the U.S. that year made a million automobiles. So did  Honda  and the company then called Fiat Chrysler. Yet the report treats Chrysler as foreign, as if it would represent a fifth column during America’s coming war with Italy.<br />The analysis of Mexico suffers the opposite problem. “Imports,” the report frets, “now exceed American-owned production in the United States.” This narrow framing excludes GM’s and Ford’s capacities across the border. Auto makers have sought efficiency by integrating North American supply chains, and the report admits that “80 percent of Mexican vehicle production is exported to the United States.”</td>

      <td>Democrats attack tech firms to deflect from Covid setbacks.</td>
      <td>When a bully gets what it wants, it comes back for more.  Facebook  has spent the last year acquiescing to increasingly aggressive liberal demands to suppress content. So it’s no surprise that Democrats have decided they can also get away with making CEO Mark Zuckerberg a scapegoat for plateauing rates of vaccination in the U.S.<br />Last week the White House launched a pointed offensive against Big Tech firms for allegedly not controlling enough vaccine-related speech by users. Press Secretary Jen Psaki criticized the companies from her daily podium, and the Surgeon General pressed them in a report. President Biden declared over the weekend that Facebook is “killing people,” though he walked back that “killing” point on Monday.<br />Sen. Amy Klobuchar snarled that social-media firms should “take this crap off of their platforms that are basically telling people, ‘oh, hey, there’s problems [with the vaccine]’ when we know science proves there isn’t.” The messages are clearly coordinated.<br />Vaccine hesitancy is slowing America’s recovery from the pandemic. Yet Facebook released a rare rebuttal to its progressive tormentors, noting that “vaccine acceptance on the part of Facebook users in the US has increased by 10-15 percentage points” to 85%. It also says the U.K. and Canada “have similar rates of Facebook usage to the US,” yet “those countries have achieved more than 70% vaccination of eligible populations,” Mr. Biden’s July 4 goal.<br />Democrats are paying for having promoted vaccine skepticism in the presidential campaign last year. Then-candidate Biden warned that a rapid approval timeline could be politicized, a point echoed by some who resist the vaccine today, and Vice President Kamala Harris publicly doubted a Trump-approved vaccine. It’s no surprise that this skepticism is now playing out among some Americans when the same politicians say vaccines are safe when they’re in power.</td>

      <td>He says more spending lowers prices by . . . well, you figure it out.</td>
      <td>The White House rolled out President Biden on Monday to take a victory lap on Covid and the economy six months into his tenure. This wasn’t the best timing given that asset prices took a header on fears about Covid’s Delta variant (see nearby). But stocks fluctuate, and more notable for the coming months was Mr. Biden’s discourse on inflation.<br />Someone in the White House must think inflation is a growing political problem because Mr. Biden spent most of his time on the subject explaining why it’s no problem at all. “Our experts believe and the data shows that most of the price increases we’ve seen are—were expected and expected to be temporary,” Mr. Biden said.<br />Price increases were expected by whom? By contributors to these pages, sure. But not by the White House budget office, which forecast inflation of 2.1% in 2021 and 2022 in its recent budget proposal. Not by the Federal Reserve, which has underestimated inflation at each of its meetings this year. At its June monetary policy meeting the median forecast among Fed officials for 2021 was 3%. In March their forecast was 2.2%. In June the actual consumer-price increase over a year ago was 5.4%.<br />Then there was Mr. Biden’s novel analysis that his $4 trillion spending plan will keep inflation in check. “If we increase the availability of quality, affordable child care, elder care, paid leave, more people will enter the workforce,” Mr. Biden said. “These steps will enhance our productivity—raising wages without raising prices. That won’t increase inflation. It will take the pressure off of inflation, give a boost to our workforce, which leads to lower prices in the years ahead.”<br />So Mr. Biden thinks that cradle-to-grave government subsidies with no obligation to work will somehow cause more people to work. That sure hasn’t worked with his enhanced federal unemployment benefits.</td>

      <td>George W. Bush and Joe Biden are contemporaries, born just four years apart. They both came of age during the Vietnam War. But as commanders in chief, the two would draw very different conclusions from Vietnam. These differences were most recently underscored by Mr. Biden’s decision to conclude the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan and bring the troops home.<br />Mr. Bush, who has mostly steered clear of politics since leaving office, publicly called Mr. Biden’s move “a mistake.” Though he didn’t invoke Vietnam, he did wonder aloud about the consequences for Afghan women and the friends America would be leaving behind. “They’re just going to be left behind to be slaughtered by these very brutal people, and it breaks my heart.”<br />President Biden betrays no such qualms.<br />“The Taliban is not the North Vietnamese Army,” he says. “There’s going to be no circumstance where you’ll see people being lifted off the roof of an Embassy of the United States from Afghanistan.”<br />Mr. Biden’s words about embassy rooftops bring back memories of a similar reference from Mr. Bush back when I served as his chief speechwriter, a time (pre-surge) when many had written Iraq off as hopeless and wanted our troops out at almost any cost. But where Mr. Biden meant these words as reassurance, Mr. Bush expressed them as resolve. “Billy,” he told me, “we are not going to abandon the people of Iraq the way we abandoned the people of Vietnam, from the rooftop of an embassy.”</td>

We lunched in Tallinn, Estonia. How many people (other than Estonians) can say that? For silver 25th we cruised again. Off the Alaskan coast, on a little boat named the Liseron, my husband caught a 55-pound halibut for our anniversary dinner.<br />This month we celebrate our 30th.

      <td>A 5,000-word essay by the strongman explains his thinking. It pays to listen.</td>
      <td>Writing long, historically focused opinion pieces is an activity more characteristic of think tankers than heads of state, but Russian President Vladimir Putin is anything but conventional. Last week he published a 5,000-plus-word article that reviews the last millennium to conclude that Russians, Belarusians and Ukrainians share a common history, faith and destiny.<br />In Mr. Putin’s view, Western powers have tried for centuries to separate them, but those efforts are doomed to fail. He argues that “the anti-Russia project has been rejected by millions of Ukrainians” in Crimea, the Donbas and elsewhere. The Russian president believes that after centuries of common development and trade, the Ukrainian economy simply cannot flourish without close integration with Russia. Without his country, Ukraine will flounder, despite the occasional aid it receives from its Western paymasters, Mr. Putin writes. Even before the pandemic, Ukraine’s gross domestic product per capita was below $4,000. “This is less than in the Republic of Albania, the Republic of Moldova, or unrecognized Kosovo.” (Moscow doesn’t recognize Kosovo’s independence from Serbia.) “Nowadays,” Mr. Putin writes, “Ukraine is Europe’s poorest country.”<br />Some observers dismissed the essay as an empty propaganda ploy aimed at distracting Russian public opinion in the face of a surging pandemic. Others saw it as an announcement that Russia will escalate its support for the pro-Moscow forces in the smoldering conflict in eastern Ukraine. Since deception and surprise are fundamental tools of Mr. Putin’s statecraft, anything is possible, but Western powers would be well advised to take the essay seriously. The Russian president’s policies will always and inevitably reflect his calculations about the opportunities and risks he faces at any given moment, but his strategic objectives are unmistakable. Mr. Putin’s quest to rebuild Russian power requires the reassertion of Moscow’s hegemony over Belarus and Ukraine.<br />In Belarus, where the Kremlin enabled the embattled government to survive months of pro-democracy protests and Western sanctions, Mr. Putin has crushed any hopes President Lukashenko had of escaping Moscow’s embrace. Ukraine is a tougher nut to crack. But the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is moving inexorably toward completion, weakening Ukraine’s influence over European policy making. Infighting and disorganization also continue to prevent the European Union from becoming a significant geopolitical actor. Amid all this, Mr. Putin has served notice that he will patiently but relentlessly pursue his strategic goals at Kyiv’s expense.<br />The best way to think of Russia these days is as being constrained but not contained. That is, the West has failed abysmally to develop a coherent policy to stop the Kremlin’s attacks on its neighbors or its opposition to the EU and the American-based world order. Sanctions don’t deter Mr. Putin; the West is hopelessly disunited on Russia policy, and the resulting incoherent policies offer Moscow opportunities from the Middle East to Myanmar to advance its foreign-policy agenda and bolster its commercial interests. Under these circumstances Russia will continue to test the West, and Mr. Putin will look to victories abroad to bolster his standing at home.</td>

      <td>An ‘emergency psychiatrist’ ﬁnds that only his patients’ words, not the language of science and medicine, can truly describe their suffering.</td>
      <td>For patients in the throes of serious mental illness—and for their families—life can be hard, at times agonizing. Clinical care givers, repeatedly called on to provide insight and offer compassion, face their own wrenching difficulties. And yet the challenge of caring for the mentally ill can also be a call to action. So it was for Karl Deisseroth, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at Stanford University whose memoir, “Projections” (Random House, 231 pages, $28), describes his experience as a clinician and researcher, offering up case studies from his practice and exploring the biological underpinnings of his patients’ conditions.<br />Dr. Deisseroth tells us that he entered medical school planning to become a neurosurgeon but found himself unexpectedly captivated by his student psychiatry rotation, drawn both to the human drama and to the scientific imperative to understand the mechanistic basis of psychological dysfunction. For many patients, he soon realized, “nobody could give answers to the simplest questions” about what their disease “really was, in a physical sense, or why this person was the one suffering, or how such a strange and terrible state had come to be part of the human experience.”<br />On his worst days, he says, he wanted to leave medicine entirely, unable to bear the extremes of suffering he was encountering. “It is not just the magnitude of the pain but also its incessance—the unrelenting descent into the abyss, day after day, year after year.” Yet on balance he found engaging with patients both intriguing and essential. In contrast to ailments like a fractured leg or a badly pumping heart, he notes, psychiatric problems can’t be directly monitored. It’s the brain’s “hidden communication process, its internal voice, that struggles,” he writes. There is nothing to measure except words, “the patient’s communications, and our own.”<br />At times, the words can be revealing. Winnie, an intellectual property lawyer, tells her doctors that she had started worrying about the “information vampires” around her and has taken to lining her room with metal to prevent a neighbor from accessing her thoughts. Her condition suggests the onset of schizophrenia. Then there’s Mr. N., a dour older patient who can barely muster any words at all and evinces a lack of interest in his own granddaughter. These symptoms may point to the “anhedonia of depression,”the inability to find reward or motivation in life’s natural joys. Patients with a slippery condition called borderline personality disorder, we learn, are often emotionally manipulative and “engage, entwine, and draw in others, as least for a time.” Meanwhile, patients with autism, Dr. Deisseroth explains, struggle with the “rate of information flow,” a difficulty that complicates the many social interactions that are rich in data and require rapid processing.<br />Dr. Deisseroth is best known in scientific circles as a pioneer of optogenetics, a technique that allows researchers studying so-called model organisms (like fish or mice) to examine how particular neurons contribute to complex behaviors. First, through genetic engineering, specific brain cells are made responsive to light. Then scientists activate the cells using fiber-optic lasers threaded into the recesses of a living brain. Applying this approach in mice, for instance, researchers have shown that distinct groups of neurons are responsible for different components of anxiety, like rapid breathing and risk avoidance. For the author, these studies suggest a way to think about the precise “separability of one element of an inner state.”</td>

      <td>They start with important truths—slavery was wicked—and get carried away into monomania.</td>
      <td>The political philosopher Isaiah Berlin turned an obscure fragment by the ancient Greek poet Archilochus (“The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing”) into an intellectual’s cocktail-party game. In a famous essay, published as a book in 1953, Berlin suggested that the world is divided between hedgehogs and foxes—between those who believe in One Big Thing (one all-sufficient super-explanation), and those who are content with a more modest, irrational and even incoherent idea of history’s unfolding. Karl Marx was a supreme hedgehog: Everything, for him, was about the conflict of economic classes. Franklin D. Roosevelt was a restlessly improvising fox.<br />The world’s hedgehog population tends to expand in times of stress and change. Lately it has exploded in the U.S. Hedgehogs are thick on the ground, all of them advancing One Big Thing or another—each peering through the lens of a particular obsession. At the moment, the biggest One Big Thing is race—the key, it seems, to all of America, to the innermost meanings of the country and its history.<br />It isn’t really true. Race is one of many big things in America. It is hardly the most important. Americans need to desanctify the subject of race—to mute its claims, which have grown absolutist and, as it were, theological in their thoroughness, their dogmatism.<br />Critical race theory has spread across the U.S. like—forgive the expression—a virus, coming to infect primary schools and high schools and universities, foundations, art museums, big corporations, the military, local, state and federal government bureaucracies. It’s everywhere in the West Wing. President Biden, who spent almost 40 years following the ways of an amiable political fox in the Senate—exchanging pleasantries and now and then doing legislative business with Confederate mossbacks like Strom Thurmond and James Eastland—has, in his old age, signed on with the monomaniacs of the left.<br />The hedgehog’s trajectory may begin on the side of undeniable and important truth—for example, the truth that slavery was a great wickedness in America (as it was elsewhere in the world), and that race prejudice has been a chronic American dilemma and a moral blight that has damaged and scarred the lives of millions of black American citizens over generations.</td>

      <td>Hospitalizations are also rising; doctors say patients are younger, sicker and largely unvaccinated</td>
      <td>Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations across the U.S. are growing steadily higher as the infectious Delta variant takes hold and the pace of vaccination subsides from highs reached in April.<br />The country has reported an average of 32,287 new coronavirus cases each day over the past week, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Johns Hopkins data, more than double what the seven-day average was 10 days ago. The uptick in cases has touched every state and Washington, D.C., with the seven-day average of newly reported cases exceeding the 14-day average in each place for the past four days, according to the data.<br />Coronavirus-related hospitalizations have also jumped, rising 35.8% between July 7 and July 13 compared with the previous seven days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br />Doctors and epidemiologists point to the Delta variant, also known as B.1.617.2, as a main cause. The variant, now dominant in the U.S., is estimated to be 40%-80% more infectious than the Alpha variant. First detected in India late last year, Delta played a significant role in a record-setting surge of infections there and has since led to increases in cases around the world. Existing Covid-19 vaccines are effective against the variant, though no vaccine is 100% effective.<br />While the latest U.S. Covid-19 metrics are still far lower than peaks reached early this year, they have raised concern among public-health officials, epidemiologists and investors. U.S. stocks, oil prices and bond yields all fell Monday as anxiety mounted over the spread of the Delta variant and its potential impact on the global economy—similar to trading patterns seen in the earliest days of pandemic.</td>

      <td>OTTAWA—Canada said it would allow fully vaccinated Americans to enter the country for recreational or tourist activities beginning Aug. 9, more than a year after authorities first closed the 5,500-mile border to most travelers to limit the spread of Covid-19.<br />The government said Monday that border restrictions for fully vaccinated travelers from other countries could also be lifted beginning Sept. 7, assuming Canada’s Covid-19 caseload stays relatively low.<br />“We are very pleased to gradually and responsibly open up,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. He said the decision to allow fully vaccinated Americans to visit Canada before tourists from other countries “is in recognition of our unique bond, especially between border communities.”<br />American citizens and permanent residents will need to provide proof of their full vaccination status, with their last dose taking place at least two weeks before their arrival, and must not have any Covid-19 symptoms, officials said. They will also be required to present evidence of an approved negative Covid-19 test taken within 72 hours of their arrival in Canada. Officials said that starting Aug. 9, they won’t require follow-up tests from people who are fully vaccinated unless they are selected for random testing.<br />The U.S. Department of Homeland Security declined to say Monday whether it planned to renew or modify its own border restrictions with Canada. The two countries will need to decide by Wednesday whether to renew their shared border restrictions for another month, as they have done since March 2020, or modify them. Canada’s public-safety minister, Bill Blair, said Monday that he was told the U.S. expects to renew its current restrictions.</td>

      <td>In Opera Parallèle’s remount of Joby Talbot and Gene Scheer’s fact-based opera, the story of a perilous mountain expedition is presented using sophisticated animation.</td>
      <td>“Everest,” an opera by Joby Talbot and Gene Scheer, made a powerful impression at its Dallas Opera world premiere in 2015. A taut, absorbing depiction of a real, ill-fated expedition to the summit of Mount Everest in 1996, the piece zeroes in on three climbers—Rob Hall (the expedition’s leader), Doug Hansen and Beck Weathers—and Jan Arnold, Hall’s pregnant wife back home. It explores their connections but mostly their profound isolation in the face of the raging blizzard that will cost Rob and Doug their lives.<br />Opera Parallèle, the home company of conductor Nicole Paiement, who led the premiere, has remounted the piece as a digital graphic novel, which is now available on demand from the Dallas Opera’s new streaming channel (rental $19.99; no subscription required; available through Jan. 16, 2022). This ingenious production focuses the action even further on that isolation, as well as on the hubris that prompts humans to challenge the unforgiving natural world, and the porous border between life and death.<br />Directed by Brian Staufenbiel, with the work of illustrator Mark Simmons and director of photography David Murakami, the film is laid out to look like a book, with multiple panes per page, floating in a black, starry background of seemingly infinite space. Black, white and shades of blue dominate the visual palette, depicting the mountain and a blank-eyed chorus of the dead—representing the hundreds of climbers killed over decades of attempts at the summit—that surrounds the living characters. Only the living humans are drawn in warm colors. They are animated in a lifelike manner, their faces made mobile with technology that reproduced the expressions of the singers as they recorded their parts in a studio. That color and movement embodies the living characters’ hope of survival but also their frailty, since the chilly, block-like backgrounds; the stiff, looming chorus; and the steady, inexorable pacing of the rest of the animation all point to a bad outcome.<br />This visual environment and tempo complemented the music, which balances the hopeful solo voices against the storm that rages in the orchestra and the eerie, echoing constancy of the chorus that counts out the time—“2:59. 3:12. 3:21”—with every minute making a safe descent less likely. The vocal characterizations are distinctive: Nathan Granner’s poignant tenor expresses Rob’s adventurous spirit, his sense of responsibility for his clients—rather than leaving the ailing Doug behind, he drags him along and finally dies beside him—and his love for Jan. Baritone Hadleigh Adams ably conveys Doug’s fundamental weakness; mezzo Sasha Cooke makes Jan, patched through to Rob as he dies on the mountain, a heartbreakingly stalwart companion. Bass Kevin Burdette embodies Beck’s life force as he hallucinates a backyard barbecue and his daughter, Meg (Charlotte Fanvu); her appearance draws him back from death and prompts him to save himself.<br />The chorus part was performed by a quartet of singers, their voices skillfully expanded into a larger ensemble through multitrack recording. The big orchestra called for in the score was represented by a digital soundtrack created by engineer Magnus Green in collaboration with Ms. Paiement, who also conducted the singers. It was efficient, and supplied the necessary momentum and background, but the richness and variety of the acoustic instrumental sound was missing, flattened into a more generalized, electronic timbral effect. Drawing and animation successfully rendered the story of “Everest” through a new lens; however, compressing its orchestral music into one dimension, while appropriate for the medium and certainly cost-effective, felt like a loss.</td>

      <td>Behind the rout, investors say, is a growing list of concerns about the recovery</td>
      <td>Stocks, bond yields and oil prices declined Monday in the most acute sign yet that investors are second-guessing the strength of the global economic recovery that sent markets soaring this year.<br />Markets rallied in the first half of 2021, thanks to investors’ bets that economies would bounce back, as countries rolled out Covid-19 vaccinations and lifted restrictions on businesses. Reports on everything from retail sales and housing prices to employment have shown swaths of the U.S. economy healing, helping send the S&P 500 to 39 record closes this year and almost double from its March 2020 trough.<br />Monday’s pullback put a dent in that narrative. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 725.81 points, or 2.1%, to 33962.04, logging its steepest decline since October. Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which falls as bond prices rise, sank to its lowest level since February. And U.S. crude oil prices slid 7.5%—marking their worst session since September.<br />Behind the rout, investors say, is a growing list of concerns about the recovery. The Delta coronavirus variant has spread rapidly, reigniting the debate in several countries about whether governments should resume lockdowns and curb activity. Meanwhile, inflation has accelerated faster than many anticipated, and strained U.S.-China relations have put pressure on trillions of dollars’ worth of U.S.-listed Chinese companies.<br />Many money managers believe the global economy will be able to keep growing. They just don’t know how quickly—and whether the gains will be enough to keep increasingly pricey-looking markets rising after a banner first half.</td>

      <td>The electronic duo’s highly anticipated album builds off the aesthetic of their first, culminating in a suite of songs that are as atmospheric as they are grounded in real time.</td>
      <td>Electronic music duo Darkside sounds very of-this-moment, but its roots can be traced back for at least a half-century. The band comprises 31-year-old Nicolás Jaar primarily on vocals and electronics and 35-year-old guitarist Dave Harrington, and each plays multiple instruments. Together, they make psychedelic dance music with long, gradual builds that are alternately unsettling and ecstatic.<br />The allure of this project is how artfully Darkside combines the passions of each member. Mr. Jaar made an immediate impact in 2011 with his solo album “Space Is Only Noise,” with songs featuring his eerie and odd voice built on the foundation of pulsing minimal techno. He has since released several solo albums and soundtracks and has staged art installations, while also collaborating with higher-profile artists as on the 2019 LP “Magdalene” by English art-pop singer FKA Twigs. Mr. Harrington’s roots are in jazz and improvisational rock, and his work under his own name touches on the Grateful Dead, early 1970s space-rock, and the jazz fusion of Miles Davis. The first Darkside full-length, 2013’s “Psychic,” found them meeting in the middle, with Mr. Jaar’s stretched out dance grooves serving as a rhythmic bed for Mr. Harrington’s spare funk riffing and cosmic exploratory leads.<br />The record was a critical hit, and the pair were an instant must-see at festivals. Their ability to stitch their songs together into long tracks with staggering climaxes brought to mind the concert prowess of Daft Punk, a connection reinforced when Darkside created an album-length remix of the French duo’s 2013 LP “Random Access Memories.” But just as Darkside seemed poised for a commercial breakthrough, Messrs. Jaar and Harrington set it aside and moved on to other work. It was almost as if they preferred to stay underground, and it was unclear if they would record as Darkside again. But after eight years and a lot of work by the two men in other realms, the project returns with “Spirals” (Matador), out Friday.<br />The LP opens with “Narrow Road” and a chiming prepared guitar, followed by the moan of Mr. Jaar’s voice. The fact that a stringed instrument is the first sound we hear serves as a preview for the rest of the record, which sticks reasonably close to the aesthetic of “Psychic” in most respects but finds Mr. Harrington stretching out instrumentally. On Darkside’s debut, his solos on electric guitar were his most notable contribution, but several tracks here are built around his acoustic playing, lending a tinge of moody, gothic folk to the bass-heavy beat.<br />Many of these pieces flow one into the next, as they do during the band’s live show, so “Spirals” often feels more like an extended suite than a collection of songs. “Narrow Road” bleeds into “The Limit,” which features Mr. Harrington’s strummed acoustic as a rhythmic element. His chordal pattern hints at jazz and funk, but does so with the absolute minimum number of notes and gestures. And his guitar has a reverberating glow that binds it to the surrounding electronics, lending a halo effect to the instrument that conjures the softer side of Roxy Music.</td>

Leichty said the university system acted reasonably to protect public health when it required all of its students, faculty and staff to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 by July 1, with limited medical and religious exceptions.<br />In saying so, the judge denied an injunction sought by eight college and graduate students who claimed the university’s vaccine policy unconstitutionally infringes on their bodily autonomy and medical privacy.<br />The case is among the first to tackle the constitutionality of Covid-19 vaccine requirements at public universities.<br />Hundreds of private and public colleges and universities have adopted vaccine policies like Indiana University’s—in schools mostly clustered on the East and West coasts. Antivaccine activists have focused on public institutions, which are bound by constitutional restraints as government entities, and have brought lawsuits under the 14th Amendment and its protection of fundamental liberties.</td>

      <td>GAO says Labor Department found $12.9 billion in misspent tax dollars, an amount that likely is low</td>
      <td>States overpaid billions in unemployment assistance after enhanced and extended benefits were approved last year, according to a federal watchdog.<br />A Government Accountability Office report issued Monday said the Labor Department found $12.9 billion in overpayments made in several unemployment programs from April 2020 through March 2021, including some benefit payments that were a result of fraud.<br />In March 2020, Washington lawmakers approved an expansion of the unemployment-benefits system in response to the Covid-19 pandemic and the related economic downturn. Two programs were created: one that offered unemployment assistance to gig workers, the self-employed and others not previously eligible for benefits, and another that extended payments after state benefits were exhausted, which typically occurs in six months or less.<br />Lawmakers also provided a federally funded enhancement on top of amounts approved by states. Initially the enhancement was $600 a week. Since late December 2020, it has been $300 a week.<br />The amount of overpayments represents about 2% of the roughly $660 billion in unemployment benefits paid out by the Treasury Department during the year ended March 31, 2021, though right- and left-leaning analysts at think tanks agree with the GAO that the overpayment rate is likely understated. The Treasury figures don’t include unemployment benefits paid by states, but do include all the enhanced and extended benefits, which were federally funded.</td>

No U.S. advertisers have asked NBCUniversal to cancel their Olympics plans, the spokesperson added.<br />A Toyota spokeswoman said the company has been running an ad titled “Start Your Impossible” in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. In the ad, which mentions Toyota’s Olympics sponsorship, athletes drive a futuristic Toyota car. The spokeswoman said the company decided a while ago not to run the ad in Japan in light of local concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.<br />A company executive in charge of public relations, Jun Nagata, told local media Monday that the decision was made because a commercial in Japan advertising Toyota’s ties to the Olympics wouldn’t be properly understood given widespread domestic concerns about the Games.</td>

      <td>The Biden administration on Monday proposed sharply higher penalties for larger hospitals that don’t make their prices public.<br />The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for enforcing rules requiring hospitals publish their prices, is seeking to raise penalties as high as $2 million a year for large hospitals that fail to make prices public. Large hospitals are those with more than 30 beds.<br />The proposed penalty is a sharp increase from the $109,500 maximum per year per hospital under existing rules. For hospitals with 30 or fewer beds, penalties remain the same.<br />The proposal comes after many hospitals failed to publish their prices as required by federal rules that took effect this year, undercutting policy makers’ goal of boosting competition and choice through transparent pricing.<br />As of Monday, data from price-transparency startup Turquoise Health Co. shows no usable pricing data from 32% of 4,885 acute care, children’s or rural primary-care hospitals.</td>

      <td>Attorney general’s order follows disclosures that the Justice Department secretly pursued phone records of journalists at several news outlets</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Attorney General Merrick Garland sharply limited federal prosecutors’ ability to obtain records of reporters’ contacts when investigating government leaks of sensitive information on Monday, curtailing a longstanding practice that had drawn criticism in recent weeks, including from President Biden.<br />In a memo to federal prosecutors, Mr. Garland said the agency’s prior policies hadn’t properly weighed the national interest in protecting journalists from forced disclosure of their sources, saying they needed such protection “to apprise the American people of the workings of their government.”<br />Mr. Garland had promised he would bar prosecutors from seizing reporters’ information after recent disclosures that the Justice Department under former President Donald Trump secretly sought and obtained 2017 phone records from reporters at the Washington Post, CNN and the New York Times while trying to identify their sources. That sparked outrage among lawmakers, press-freedom organizations and Mr. Biden, who said he would no longer allow such tactics.<br />Mr. Garland, who as a federal judge took strong stands in support of reporters’ rights and First Amendment protections, told lawmakers in June that the new policy would be the “most protective of journalists’ ability to do their jobs in history.” He met with news executives to discuss their concerns at least twice in recent weeks.<br />The new policy includes exceptions for cases involving an agent of a foreign power or a member of a foreign terrorist organization, or when steps need to be taken to “prevent an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm,” the memo said.</td>

      <td>The end of economic contraction marks official starting point for the uneven expansion since then</td>
      <td>The U.S. officially climbed out of a recession in April 2020, concluding a pandemic-driven economic contraction that lasted two months, making it the shortest on record.<br />The announcement Monday from the National Bureau of Economic Research also marks April as the official start of the economic recovery from the initial shock of the coronavirus pandemic last spring, which triggered widespread business and school closures, a steep drop in demand for services and record job losses.<br />The recession ended the country’s longest recorded economic expansion, which began in June 2009 and lasted 128 months, according to the bureau’s Business Cycle Dating Committee, the accepted arbiter of recession dates in the U.S.<br />The committee uses a variety of indicators to identify the peaks and troughs that frame economic contractions, defining “recession” as a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy that typically lasts more than a few months. The group typically waits until a business cycle is well under way before declaring it has started. While it broke with past practice last summer by saying when the most recent recession began, it took more than a year for it to declare its duration.<br />“The recent downturn had different characteristics and dynamics than prior recessions,” the NBER committee said in a statement. “Nonetheless, the committee concluded that the unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warranted the designation of this episode as a recession, even though the downturn was briefer than earlier contractions.”</td>

As part of the agreement, Mr. Joseph will become foreign minister in Mr. Henry’s cabinet. Other appointments are still under negotiation.<br />In an audio recording sent to reporters late Sunday, Mr. Henry said he would seek to collaborate with political factions to unify the country.<br />“As prime minister, I make a solemn appeal to national unity…to protect our country from the multiple dangers that trouble us,” he said. “It is going to be through dialogue and collaboration that we will shape together the policies to implement in this interim period.”</td>

Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), would oversee the Biden administration’s plans to tighten regulations on Wall Street firms. That could include heightened scrutiny of cryptocurrencies; open-end mutual funds and hedge funds and their roles in market turbulence last year; and the financial sector’s exposure to climate-change risks.<br />Mr. Steele is the director of the Corporations and Society Initiative at Stanford Graduate School of Business, which seeks to “promote more accountable capitalism and governance,” according to its website. He previously served as a staffer at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and also worked at Public Citizen, a progressive watchdog group, before joining Mr. Brown’s staff in 2010.<br />In recent years, he has been a vocal proponent of treating climate change as a systemic risk to the financial system, and called on U.S. regulators to do more to confront the potential dangers, such as more frequent wildfires or droughts that threaten banks’ physical assets.<br />In a February 2020 paper, he argued the 2010 Dodd-Frank law gave regulators broad power to use macroprudential regulation to address climate-related risks, including through the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Federal Reserve. For example, the Fed could use its authority to limit fossil-fuel investments based on their prospective risks to financial stability, he said.</td>

Some traders also remain wary of more travel shutdowns, which would have an outsize impact on oil prices.<br />“If we stagnate or retrace some of the demand increase we’ve seen thus far, the market will move from being undersupplied to oversupplied into the back half of the year,” said Rebecca Babin, a senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth, U.S.<br />Brent crude, the global gauge of oil prices, ended the day down 6.8% at $68.62 a barrel.</td>

      <td>The most curious claim is the one that he somehow restrained Trump from starting a war with Iran.</td>
      <td>Gen. Mark Milley is a courageous and honorable man who has served his country with uncommon gallantry. There are few less edifying spectacles in modern life than to watch those whose military experience never went beyond playing with GI Joes sneerily denounce the actions of men who have repeatedly put their lives on the line for their country. Like all top military leaders, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs has played the politics of Washington like a finely-tuned harp, but he has also served multiple tours of active duty. In a nation that canonizes violent criminals and beatifies self-absorbed celebrities, the general is a living reminder of the qualities that actually made this country great.<br />But his repeatedly demonstrated valor shouldn’t inoculate him from accountability for his words. By all accounts Gen. Milley is a thoughtful man and that should equip him to understand that he has made a grave mistake that risks great harm to his own reputation and to the trust Americans place in the integrity of their military.<br />This isn’t a complaint about his apparent genuflection to the postmodern cultural orthodoxy of inherent white sinfulness (though the report published last week and reported in these pages about the U.S. Navy’s readiness—or lack thereof—puts some flesh on the bones of the criticism that the politically sensitive modern American military hasn’t got its priorities in order).<br />The more immediate damage Gen. Milley risks stems from his decision to spend much of the past six months apparently scripting his own John Frankenheimer remake for the benefit of eager journalists and his approving masters in the White House. In the past week we’ve had breathless accounts from a proliferation of books by reporters about Donald Trump’s final hours in office that cast the general as the hero-soldier of “Six Days in January,” a real-life movie in which he saves the nation from—I think I have this right—World War III, a coup d’état and the desecration of the Constitution.<br />Gen. Milley is a keen student of history, and in these florid accounts we are invited to see a man who identifies with Benjamin Franklin and his fellow revolutionaries in ”all hanging together” against President Trump, and who lets us know that if only he’d been around in 1933, the Reichstag Fire wouldn’t have led to the Nazis’ seizure of power.</td>

      <td>The agency overcounts Covid hospitalizations and deaths and won’t consider if one shot is sufficient.</td>
      <td>A tremendous number of government and private policies affecting kids are based on one number: 335. That is how many children under 18 have died with a Covid diagnosis code in their record, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Yet the CDC, which has 21,000 employees, hasn’t researched each death to find out whether Covid caused it or if it involved a pre-existing medical condition.<br />Without these data, the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices decided in May that the benefits of two-dose vaccination outweigh the risks for all kids 12 to 15. I’ve written hundreds of peer-reviewed medical studies, and I can think of no journal editor who would accept the claim that 335 deaths resulted from a virus without data to indicate if the virus was incidental or causal, and without an analysis of relevant risk factors such as obesity.<br />My research team at Johns Hopkins worked with the nonprofit FAIR Health to analyze approximately 48,000 children under 18 diagnosed with Covid in health-insurance data from April to August 2020. Our report found a mortality rate of zero among children without a pre-existing medical condition such as leukemia. If that trend holds, it has significant implications for healthy kids and whether they need two vaccine doses. The National Education Association has been debating whether to urge schools to require vaccination before returning to school in person. How can they or anyone debate the issue without the right data?<br />Meanwhile, we’ve already seen inflated Covid death numbers in the U.S. revised downward. Last month Alameda County, Calif., reduced its Covid death toll by 25% after state public-health officials insisted that deaths be attributed to Covid only if the virus was a direct or contributing factor.<br />Organizations and politicians who are eager to get every living American vaccinated are following the CDC without understanding the limitations of the methodology. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky claimed that vaccinating a million adolescent kids would prevent 200 hospitalizations and one death over four months. But the agency’s Covid adolescent hospitalization report, like its death count, doesn’t distinguish on the website whether a child is hospitalized for Covid or with Covid. The subsequent Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report of that analysis revealed that 45.7% “were hospitalized for reasons that might not have been primarily related” to Covid-19.</td>

And how does President Joe Biden return the favor? Now safely ensconced in the White House, Mr. Biden accused the company of mass homicide on Friday—and didn’t retract his statement until Monday.

That’s exactly what he was saying last week, as Mr. Restuccia notes:<br />As deceptive and ungracious as Mr. Biden’s retreat is, perhaps he realized—to the extent he is able to realize such things—that he had stumbled into an argument that he was not going to win. Over the weekend Facebook vice president Guy Rosenwrote on the company’s blog:<br />Hmm. So why has the U.S. experience been so different?

Ted Kennedy or Mayor John Lindsay might pay more in taxes should their policies be adopted. But they have already accumulated their wealth, and a little less is not going to change their lifestyles. Besides, wealthy candidates running for office often seek to trade part of their wealth for power. Even if they lose, some near-wealthy candidates, like New York’s Maya Wiley, can gain prominence and enhance their careers with a credible run for office. This is the textbook definition of self-interest.<br />It’s not hypocrisy or values but life experience that matters most. Few candidates know what it feels like to be down and out, to try and raise a family on a minimum wage. Even Kamala Harris had parents who came to this country to pursue their doctoral degrees.<br />The left can’t find true working-class candidates to run because they’re too busy working. The best it can do is to field well-intentioned limousine liberals who try to make up for their lack of working-class experience by advocating far-reaching social programs, assuming that this is what the working class wants. Then they wonder why many working-class voters support Republicans, whose economic policies “run counter to their economic interests.” Might it be that limousine liberals misunderstood their needs in the first place?<br />Joseph P.

      <td>Managing the entitlement more effectively upsets the agency’s union leaders.</td>
      <td>Social Security is the third rail of U.S. politics. As George W. Bush wrote, touch it and you are toast. Now you are toast if you manage the program to serve Americans better (“The Meaning of Biden’s Firing Spree,” Review & Outlook, July 13).<br />President Biden fired Social Security Commissioner Andrew Saul because he pushed hard to make systems and operations more efficient. Managing Social Security more effectively upsets the agency’s union leaders.<br />Under the Social Security statute, the commissioner can be removed only for cause. Union disapproval does not meet that test. But Supreme Court rulings that similar removal clauses for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Federal Housing Finance Agency were unconstitutional emboldened the president to give the unions what they wanted.<br />Mr. Biden also thumbed his nose at effective management by appointing an acting commissioner, Kilolo Kijakazi, with limited management experience. She served on the Bipartisan Policy Center’s 19-member Commission on Retirement Security, for which I was a chairman. The politically balanced, distinguished members approved a plan to fix Social Security by increasing benefits for lower-income retirees, slowing down benefit growth for the higher-income, and gradually increasing taxes. The only dissenter was Ms. Kijakazi.<br />James B. Lockhart III</td>

      <td>Community violence intervention programs offer one promising approach to national problem</td>
      <td>Washington Nationals pitchers had just finished a disappointing half-inning when the sound of gunfire pierced the normal crowd noise at Nationals Park Saturday night. The sound was unmistakable, though the source was a mystery: Was it just another random Washington shooting, or a Mandalay Bay-style attack in which a gunman was seeking mass murder in a crowded venue?<br />The 33,000 people inside the stadium weren’t going to wait to find out. They surged toward the exits and spilled out onto the streets, taking cover where they could find it, including some of us who found refuge in an apartment building thanks to a stranger who simply held open the door. The exodus was fairly orderly under the circumstances; most disconcerting were the scattered scenes of parents huddled over crying children.<br />The gunfire turned out to be a drive-by shooting just outside the stadium gates, in which at least three people were wounded. Thus the incident, while unsettling on a larger scale, was less traumatic than the shooting just one day earlier and 3 miles away in which a 6-year-old girl, who had not yet started first grade, was killed when caught in a similar outburst of gunfire.<br />She was among 101 homicide victims in Washington this year and, as the Washington Post noted in its coverage, died on the third anniversary of the shooting death of a 10-year-old killed by a stray bullet while walking to an ice-cream truck, and seven months after a 15-month-old was struck while in a car seat.<br />There now is no doubt that America, particularly urban America, is experiencing a post-pandemic surge in gun violence. The Major Cities Chiefs Association, an organization of large-city police executives, reports that homicides in those jurisdictions rose 29% in the first quarter over the same period a year earlier, while aggravated assaults rose 9%. That follows a 33% rise in homicides in 2020 over 2019.</td>

The MSS, he added, had “fostered an ecosystem of criminal contract hackers who carry out both state-sponsored activities and cybercrime for their own financial gain.”<br />The U.K. and European Union joined in the attribution of the Microsoft email hack, which rendered an estimated hundreds of thousands of mostly small businesses and organizations vulnerable to cyber intrusion. But the public shaming did not include punitive measures, such as sanctions or diplomatic expulsions, a contrast with how the administration recently punished Russia for a range of alleged malicious cyber activity.</td>

She said he forced her to endure a “cycle of intimidation, abuse and humiliation.”<br />In court papers filed in New York County, attorneys for Mr. Black say that the married private-equity mogul was engaged in a consensual, on-and-off relationship with Ms. Ganieva for six years until she began extorting him in 2015 by threatening to go public with their affair.<br />During their relationship, Mr. Black gave Ms. Ganieva millions of dollars of gifts, paying the rent for her pricey Upper East Side apartment, buying her a luxury car and Steinway piano, financing lavish vacations, paying her tuition at acting school and at Columbia University, and funding a $40,000 commissioned portrait of her, according to the court filing.<br />In 2015, Ms. Ganieva asked for a meeting with Mr. Black, during which she threatened to go public with their relationship unless he paid her an additional large sum of money, the filing states. While Mr. Black didn’t meet her initial demand of $100 million, the two did reach an agreement later that year, according to the court document.</td>

The number of funded Robinhood accounts increased by 4.5 million between the end of March and the end of June, reaching 22.5 million in total.<br />But the company’s growth is decelerating from the torrid pace earlier in the year.

The agreement also provides an avenue for AT&T to use some Dish wireless spectrum licenses to support both companies’ customers, according to the filing.<br />The partnership will likely attract scrutiny from the U.S. Justice Department, which helped Dish’s entry into the wireless market through a complex deal that cleared the way for cellphone carrier  T-Mobile US Inc.  to buy Sprint Corp.

Wall Street analysts have predicted that the two TV providers could save money by merging, though antitrust enforcers might resist the combination of two businesses that are often the only source of pay-TV channels in rural areas.

Prosecutors have charged 20 traders with spoofing misconduct and settled criminal cases over spoofing with  JPMorgan Chase  & Co.,  Deutsche Bank AG  and  Bank of America Corp.<br />Another trial is set to begin Monday in Chicago federal court against two former Bank of America traders, Edward Bases and John Pacilio. The two are accused of spoofing precious-metals futures on exchanges operated by  CME Group Inc.  The trial, which could last three weeks, will involve debates over trading charts that purport to show the spoofing, as well as testimony from traders and expert witnesses interpreting whether the conduct was manipulative. Messrs. Bases and Pacilio have denied the government’s allegations.<br />Mr. Zink and the Justice Department fraud section doubled down on the campaign after losing their first spoofing trial in 2018 against a former UBS Group AG trader. The department prevailed at trial last year against two former Deutsche Bank precious-metals traders accused of spoofing. The defendants were sentenced last month to a year in prison.</td>

      <td>China’s new national carbon market is up and running. But to really be effective, carbon prices will have to rise quickly.</td>
      <td>While the world has been focused on spacefaring billionaires over the past week, a big development for planet Earth has only merited moderate attention: On Friday, China’s long awaited national carbon market started trading.<br />How well that market functions could go a long way toward deciding how much chance the world really has to reduce the probability of worst-case climate scenarios. It also could end up being a key issue between China and the West. If the U.S. and the European Union conclude China is serious about tackling emissions, that could help spur more aggressive climate action in the developed world—and open up more space for a less zero-sum approach to relations in general.<br />So far, cautious optimism is probably warranted. But the price of carbon in China is still clearly too low, and the market itself still excludes key energy users like steel. Both need to change soon. Without a declining supply of total credits over time and auctions as in Europe—rather than just allowances distributed to power producers based on their previous years’ power and carbon output as in China’s current system—substantial emissions cuts could remain elusive. The shaky finances of coal plants and their banks also muddy the water for Beijing on tough, quick action against the fuel.<br />The carbon market closed at 51.23 yuan, equivalent to $7.91, per metric ton on Friday according to Thomson Reuters. That is still well below prices in Europe, where a metric ton will cost you around $60, and probably below levels needed to really change behavior. For instance,  ANZ Bank  estimates that a 36 yuan per metric ton carbon price would only represent around an extra 5% operational cost for Chinese coal plants. And a 2016 World Bank paper found that reducing Chinese emissions in 2030 by 16% from their baseline estimate would require carbon prices rising to 157 yuan per metric ton by that date.<br />Regulators do appear open to fixing problems. Draft regulations released in January set a maximum penalty of only 30,000 yuan ($4,630) for not buying enough offsets. A more recent proposal from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment in March suggests a 500,000 yuan maximum. For large generators that may still be far too low, but at least it shows a willingness to move in the right direction.</td>

While the company has touted rapid progress in debt reduction, as of March it still had interest-bearing debts of 674 billion yuan, equivalent to $104 billion.<br />Evergrande’s Hong Kong-traded stock dropped 16% to close at 8.21 Hong Kong dollars, equivalent to $1.06, the lowest since early 2017. The company’s onshore and international bonds also fell in price. A 10.5% dollar bond due 2024 declined 6 cents to 61.4 cents on the dollar, lifting yields to 33%, according to Tradeweb.<br />A court in east China’s Jiangsu province froze 132 million yuan, equivalent to $20.4 million, of bank deposits and assets held by Evergrande units, at the request of lender China Guangfa Bank Co. The ruling was uploaded on July 13 to a Chinese government portal, but was circulating among investors on Monday. The court said it made the decision to protect Guangfa’s legal interests.<br />Evergrande said a subsidiary owed 132 million yuan to a Guangfa Bank branch in Jiangsu, but said the loan isn’t due until March 27, 2022. Evergrande said it would sue the bank for abusing legal procedures. Calls to Guangfa Bank went unanswered on Monday afternoon.</td>

      <td>German company agrees to buy R&D and manufacturing facility aimed at cutting edge cancer therapies</td>
      <td>BioNTech  SE, the company behind one of the most widely used vaccines against Covid-19, has agreed to acquire a U.S. manufacturing plant from Kite, a unit of  Gilead Sciences Inc.,  in a deal aimed at strengthening its core business of developing cutting-edge cancer therapies.<br />The deal focuses on Kite’s research, development and manufacturing activities relating to neoantigen T-cell receptor cell therapy, an experimental form of cancer treatment. BioNTech said it would acquire Kite’s neoantigen TCR cell therapy research and development platform, and a manufacturing facility comprising 50 employees in Gaithersburg, Md. The companies didn’t disclose the financial terms.<br />BioNTech shot to fame for the Covid-19 vaccine that it co-developed with Pfizer Inc.--the first shot authorized for use in the U.S. and Europe. But its main focus before the pandemic had been developing personalized cancer therapies that harness the body’s own immune system.<br />Among the approaches it was investigating were so-called mRNA vaccines aimed at training the body’s immune system to fight tumors. These vaccines are based on genetic material containing the instructions for key proteins linked to the virus or cancer cell in question.<br />Early in the pandemic, BioNTech quickly pivoted to aim that technology at the new virus. The resulting vaccine was developed at breakneck speed and became its first, and so far only, authorized product. That work transformed BioNTech from relative obscurity to one of the best-known companies in the world.</td>

      <td>Election-related litigation has surged in recent years as political parties seek an advantage</td>
      <td>Voting laws passed in the wake of the 2020 election are facing a wave of court challenges, setting up a series of legal battles this year that could help reshape the rules around voting for years to come.<br />At least two dozen states have passed laws this year that either expand voting rules or tighten them, according to New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, a public-policy think tank. At least 30 lawsuits are aimed at laws in 11 states that opponents say restrict voting access with measures such as shortening the time period for mail-in and early voting, increasing verification requirements and placing limits on providing food or water to people waiting in line to vote.<br />Mostly liberal groups have challenged these new bills on grounds that they violate aspects of the Voting Rights Act, the First and 14th Amendments and the Americans with Disabilities Act. In Georgia, which has become the epicenter of the fight, groups have filed nine lawsuits over legislation that was passed in late March, according to the Brennan Center. A lawsuit filed by the Justice Department last month against Georgia added firepower to the legal battle over the new voting laws.<br />The states and conservative legal groups supporting the laws say they are necessary to bolster public confidence in elections and dismiss the litigation as meritless. Liberal groups say these laws are designed to make it harder for people of color to vote and potentially give an edge to Republicans in future elections.<br />The lawsuits are part of a surge in voting-related litigation after a series of close national elections showed both political parties that something as seemingly mundane as election rules can be key to their hold on power, legal academics said. The high stakes fuel both legislative action and fundraising for more lawsuits, said New York University law professor Richard Pildes.</td>

Chip shares have risen in part thanks to a pandemic-induced global shortage of semiconductors that has driven up the prices of everything from laptops to automobiles.<br />One reason for Nvidia’s outperformance, analysts say, is that its chips’ parallel-computing capabilities make them better than rivals’ for artificial-intelligence performance and mining cryptocurrencies. Nvidia’s graphics processors are used for mining ethereum and the cryptocurrency’s value has soared this year, even after a recent correction.<br />That surge has exacerbated the shortage of gaming chips. Nvidia plans to sell cards aimed at the crypto market and has employed technical adjustments to make gaming processors less useful to miners. Analysts also expect Nvidia to get a boost from tech and autonomous-vehicle companies using its chips to navigate traffic or track online behavior.</td>

Some companies have had to scale back production and delay new releases. All this has halted what had been a strong start to the year.<br />Smartphone makers, for much of the year, avoided the parts disruptions faced in the auto, personal computer and home-appliance industries. Phone manufacturers purchase key parts roughly a half a year in advance, but now those stockpiles have shrunk.<br />For  Samsung Electronics Co. , the world’s largest smartphone maker, problems sourcing key parts contributed to an expected 20% drop in shipments from the previous quarter.

We’re literally making history tonight.”<br />England officially dropped almost all coronavirus restrictions Monday, including mask requirements and size limits on gatherings, in a bet by Prime Minister Boris Johnson that mass vaccination—and British common sense—will prevent another deadly wave of Covid-19. Mr. Johnson has said most legally enforceable public-health measures would be relaxed and the public must decide for themselves what risks they are willing to bear when considering wearing masks or staying away from crowds, as is the case in some U.S. states.<br />The plan represents a radical experiment in managing Covid-19 as the rich world enters a new phase of the pandemic where vaccines mean the virus is down but not out. Anxiety over what happens next has split scientists, lawmakers and the public.<br />“The virus sadly is still out there,” Mr. Johnson said late Sunday in a message urging people to be cautious. He and his finance chief entered a 10-day spell of isolation Sunday after Health Secretary Sajid Javid tested positive for Covid-19. “Go forward tomorrow into the next step with all the right prudence and respect for other people and the risks that the disease continues to present,” Mr. Johnson said.</td>

As those talks falter, the U.S. is running through options intended to induce Iran to keep negotiating or punish it if it doesn’t, according to U.S. officials and people familiar with the matter.<br />One plan being drafted would choke off Iran’s swelling crude-oil sales to China, the country’s main client, through fresh sanctions targeting the shipping networks that help export an estimated one million barrels a day and bring critical revenue to Iran, the officials said.<br />The new steps would take place if nuclear talks fail, the officials said. The plan would involve the aggressive enforcement of current sanctions already banning dealings with Iran’s oil and shipping industry through new designations or legal actions, the officials said. In the past, the U.S. has, for instance, sanctioned the captain of a Syria-bound Iranian crude tanker and obtained the seizure of fuel cargoes Tehran was sending to Venezuela.</td>

State and local governments, along with institutions such as hospitals and universities, issue municipal bonds to raise money for projects that include building schools and paving roads.<br />Many affluent households fear that President Biden and the Democratic-controlled Congress will raise taxes. On the campaign trail, Mr. Biden proposed raising the top individual income-tax rate to 39.6% from 37%, among other changes to taxes for high-income households and corporations. Democrats won control of Congress—but narrowly—and recently have been working to decide which tax proposals they should try to pass. That change in the top individual rate is one of the proposals that has the broadest support among Democrats and appears more likely to occur than other proposals.</td>

The U-turn is a setback for Mr. Ackman, who crafted a first-of-its-kind pact that set it apart from a wave of other deals orchestrated recently by special-purpose acquisition companies.<br />In June, Mr. Ackmann said his SPAC had agreed to buy a 10% stake in Universal from French media conglomerate Vivendi SE for about $4 billion. The deal valued Universal at some $40 billion. Typically, such deals involve a previously listed SPAC, or blank-check company, merging with an unlisted business, taking it public.<br />Mr. Ackman’s deal was different: New York Stock Exchange-listed Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd., the SPAC, didn’t intend to merge with Universal but instead become a shareholder ahead of an already-planned listing by Universal in the Netherlands. People familiar with the matter said it was structured that way because of tax and legal implications for Vivendi, The Wall Street Journal reported.<br />The structure was hailed by some as a feat of financial engineering that also freed Mr. Ackman from some of the usual constraints of SPACs.

The networks, currently owned by Jamaica-based Digicel Group, are adjacent to subsea cables that carry communications between Australia and its neighbors.<br />A deal would be the latest move by the Australian government seeking to limit Chinese influence in the region, particularly in the telecommunications sector. Australia has banned Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei Technologies Co. from involvement in its 5G mobile network. In 2018, Australia said it would build an undersea high-speed internet cable to the Solomon Islands, shutting out Huawei from the project.

The Saudi Public Investment Fund will own over 60% of the company, which is expected to have a market capitalization of about $36 billion based on the SPAC’s current share price.<br />The listing represents the fruits of a well-timed 2018 investment in Lucid when it was struggling for survival. Its Saudi lifeline came thanks to Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince who was pushing his country’s Public Investment Fund to spend unprecedented sums on startups as part of a bid to diversify the country’s wealth away from oil.<br />More recently, the Saudi investment in Lucid benefited from the meme stock phenomenon that has reshaped financial markets. A flood of amateur stock traders has pushed up prices of companies merging with SPACs, especially in the electric-vehicle space, as traders bet that startups will emulate  Tesla  Inc.’s  stock market success leveraging the auto industry’s shift away from gasoline engines.<br />Lucid and the SPAC it is merging with,  Churchill Capital Corp. IV ,  gained a particularly avid following on Reddit and  Twitter .  After the pending merger of the two companies was reported in January, an online frenzy pushed Churchill’s stock up more than 500% by February before shares retreated significantly.</td>

The latter could include requiring money funds to be backed by equity capital in the way that banks are—although similar proposals have been rejected before.

He has said he hopes this will be the first of thousands that can make space travel safe and routine, and cheap enough to allow millions to follow. Eventually.<br />Richard Branson’s  Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc.  also plans to take tourists to space after flying its founder there earlier this month. Blue Origin aims eventually to use its space exploration to tap the energy and material resources of the solar system to save this planet.<br />The flight is scheduled for 9 a.m. EDT Tuesday and will be livestreamed by Blue Origin starting at 5.30 a.m. on outlets including wsj.com. Weather or technical glitches could delay the launch from Van Horn, Texas. The current forecast shows a slight chance of rain that is expected to clear in time.</td>

      <td>TOKYO—A Tokyo court on Monday sentenced Americans Michael Taylor and Peter Taylor to prison for their roles in the escape of former Nissan Motor Co. chief Carlos Ghosn from Japan.<br />Michael Taylor, a 60-year-old former Green Beret, received a two-year sentence. Peter Taylor, his 28-year-old son, received a sentence of one year and eight months. The court said they would get credit for 90 days already served in Japan.<br />The sentences are the latest fallout from the flight of the former Nissan chairman from Japan in late December 2019, which allowed him to avoid a trial over financial charges. Mr. Ghosn, who had been living in Tokyo, hid inside a box and departed Japan on a private jet, ultimately arriving in Lebanon where he now lives. He denies wrongdoing and says he fled because he didn’t think he could get a fair trial.<br />The Taylors’ defense team had sought a suspended sentence that would have allowed the defendants to return home quickly. The defense argued the Taylors were motivated by an altruistic desire to rescue a man from a Japanese justice system they believed tortured people. After their extradition to Japan in March, the Taylors said they no longer believed that the Japanese justice system tortures people, based on their firsthand experience.<br />Presiding Judge Hideo Nirei said the father-son duo deserved prison time.</td>

      <td>My firing as commissioner violates a 1994 law that aimed to shield the agency from partisanship.</td>
      <td>The name of the Social Security Administration’s commissioner isn’t one most Americans would recognize. This is largely by design. Congress, presidents from both parties, and previous commissioners have made it a point to ensure the commissioner’s role remains nonpartisan. That is why President Biden’s decision to fire me is so unsettling. I was only two years into my six-year term as SSA commissioner. By targeting me, the administration has politicized the SSA.<br />The Social Security Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994 brought the SSA out from under the Department of Health and Human Services and made it an independent agency. The law established that an SSA commissioner “may be removed from office only pursuant to a finding by the president of neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.” The email asking for my resignation gave no reason for termination.<br />Throughout my career, I have worked under both Democratic and Republican administrations to serve the American people. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama trusted me to serve as chairman of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board.<br />SSA commissioners, given their term length, have served different administrations in the past. Following his 2007 appointment by Mr. Bush, Commissioner Michael Astrue served through Mr. Obama’s first term and into his second. Mr. Biden should remember this well since he was vice president at the time.<br />The purpose of the fixed, six-year tenure for SSA commissioners is to provide stability for the agency and to shield it from partisan meddling. For a sense of the independent and bipartisan nature of SSA commissioners, look no further than my 77-16 confirmation vote in the Senate. As commissioner, I made it a priority to keep the agency nonpolitical, and most of my executive staff were career civil servants. But with one action, Mr. Biden created confusion and uncertainty about the political neutrality of SSA commissioners.</td>

Diego Suarez, who was at that meeting, told me last week by phone from Miami that, in the KGB man’s opinion, Havana’s internal-security apparatus was more sophisticated than the Kremlin’s.<br />A former senior U.S. official told me on Wednesday that when he and others met with the same KGB general—Oleg Kalugin—in Washington in 2001, he told them that the machine controlling the Cuban police state was more “effective” than the Soviet system had been.<br />This testimony is worth contemplating in the wake of unprecedented antigovernment demonstrations across Cuba last week. The island’s rich ruling elite have spent decades cultivating a monstrous, merciless state-security structure for occasions such as this. Now it has unleashed a wave of terror on the island that would make Stalin blush.<br />Watching the Interior Ministry and the military do their dirty work, it’s hard to believe regime collapse is imminent. Yet last week’s protests overwhelmed a network that is supposed to be airtight. The breadth of the uprising reveals a nation at the breaking point. Any lingering pretense of regime legitimacy has been shredded—at home and abroad.<br />On July 11 in the municipality of San Antonio de los Baños, some 22 miles from Havana, a group of pro-democracy activists launched a protest. It was far from the first of its kind. This column has been documenting the work of Cuban dissidents for more than two decades. But on that Sunday something new happened.</td>

      <td>Minecraft started as a Covid diversion and became a class in political science.</td>
      <td>My kids survived lockdown by living online, playing Minecraft. They linked up with friends and escaped into this virtual realm, where the goal is to survive and prosper in the wilderness. They re-created “Lord of the Flies,” marooning themselves on a distant world free of adult supervision, where they either had to create a new society or, well, kill one another.<br />In an age when videogames and action movies keep getting faster, Minecraft is mind-numbingly slow. My younger son, 12, spent weeks raising turtles on a farm to get their shells. I am astounded that he has the patience to do this. He is reluctant to walk our real dog, but he cares enthusiastically for his virtual pets.<br />In the real world, I provide for all of my kids’ needs, but in Minecraft they have to work for everything they create. A neighbor told me that for the first time she can remember, her son swept the kitchen floor. “It’s kind of like playing Minecraft,” he told her, adding that he’d just finished cleaning debris (known as “podzol”) from his online property.<br />The kids get really upset when someone steals their stuff. And no one wants to maintain the communal areas. To establish some order, one of the kids—the James Madison of the group—decided to draft a set of basic governing principles in their dedicated chat room. The kids, eager to protect what they had built, all signed the document.<br />These rules specially prohibit “griefing”—either being a nuisance or disrupting the experience by exploiting quirks in the game’s design. To enforce the rule, the kids built a courthouse and appointed a judge. They were excited about the first trial—the adjudication of a theft of “netherite,” a rare mineral. It was like the olden days when town folks flocked to the courtroom to witness a spectacle. The trial began at 8 p.m. on a Friday. The opposing sides made their respective arguments. The judge—the oldest player and Gandalf of the group—ruled, and then a fight broke out and the players all killed one another. Fortunately, in Minecraft, players can come back to life. In the end there were no hard feelings.</td>

Ms. Tamimi, an unabashed advocate for terrorism against Israelis and Jews, lives free in Jordan despite its 1995 extradition treaty with the U.S.<br />Malki and her friend stopped for lunch at a pizzeria in central Jerusalem and were at the counter when a Hamas human bomb, a young man carrying a shrapnel-laced exploding guitar case, entered. Ms. Tamimi, who later called this “my operation,” picked the site for throngs of children it attracted and brought him there, instructing him what to do and fleeing minutes before the thunderous explosion.<br />Arrested by Israeli forces and tried, Ms. Tamimi admitted all charges and was sentenced in 2003 to 16 life terms. But in 2011, she and 1,026 other convicts were exchanged by Israel for a soldier, Gilad Shalit, held hostage by Hamas. Stunned, we watched Ms. Tamimi’s arrival in Jordan on Oct. 18, 2011, to raucous receptions at Amman’s airport, in a courthouse and at the University of Jordan. Exultant media interviews underscored her utter lack of regret.</td>

      <td>The case of Carlos Ghosn lays bare the differences in corporate, legal and political cultures between Japan and the West.</td>
      <td>On Nov. 19, 2018, Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn was taken into custody as he passed through Tokyo’s Haneda airport. He was eventually charged with underreporting his income and using millions in Nissan funds to cover personal investment losses, and if convicted he faced up to 15 years in prison. But after spending 130 days in custody, and posting $13.7 million in bail, he fled Japan for Lebanon, hiding in an audio equipment case as it was rolled onto a private jet. He now lives in Beirut, out of reach of Japanese prosecutors.<br />It’s an astonishing story, but only a small part of the one that Hans Greimel, a veteran car industry reporter, and William Sposato, a journalist based for many years in Japan, choose to tell in “Collision Course: Carlos Ghosn and the Culture Wars That Upended an Auto Empire.” Messrs. Greimel and Sposato’s book is less a tale of Mr. Ghosn’s rise and fall than an examination of the differences in corporate, legal and political cultures between Japan and the West. How is it that such advanced economies and societies can so often misunderstand each other? And was Mr. Ghosn simply a victim of this historic pattern?<br />Mr. Ghosn was born in Brazil to a family with Lebanese roots. As a child he moved to Lebanon and then France, where he stayed, earning a pair of engineering degrees and rising through the ranks at Michelin and later Renault. A citizen of France, Brazil and Lebanon, he is fluent in English, French, Portuguese and Arabic. In 1999, when Renault invested in Nissan, Mr. Ghosn was tapped as chief operating officer of the Japanese automaker.<br />At Renault, headquartered near Paris, Mr. Ghosn was known as “Le Cost Killer,” and in his new role he more than lived up to his reputation. He cut jobs, closed plants, paid down debt and renegotiated with suppliers, paying no regard to Japan’s cozy corporate networks and traditions. Within three years Mr. Ghosn had risen to become chief executive, and Nissan was back in the black. He lived the part of the globe-trotting corporate titan, jetting frequently between Tokyo and Paris and elsewhere, preaching the importance of scale in the car industry. In the meantime, he and his wife raised four children, before they divorced in 2012. When Mr. Ghosn married a second time in 2016, he celebrated with a party at the Palace of Versailles that would come to symbolize his growing hubris.<br />While other international car partnerships failed, including Daimler-Chrysler and Volkswagen-Suzuki, Mr. Ghosn made Renault-Nissan work. He capped his career in 2016 with the purchase of a controlling stake in Mitsubishi, creating the largest auto group in the world. One of Mr. Ghosn’s former advisers told the authors of “Collision Course” that what his boss was trying to do “was unprecedented in the history of the auto industry, which was combine strong companies that are truly nationally significant and keep them together,” not just for one economic cycle but in a way that “was really permanent.” Given the economic and symbolic importance of the car industry, he was also frequently having to manage the attentions of meddlesome politicians.</td>

      <td>Biden’s capital-gains rate hike is worse than it looks. Under rising prices, it could eat 112% of a return.</td>
      <td>June’s 5.4% inflation highlights one of President Biden’s more damaging and quixotic economic proposals: to raise the top tax rate on capital gains. Nominally, he would pull it up to match the tax rate on ordinary income. But the real rate, taking inflation into account, would be so high that investors could dramatically change their behavior, badly harming the economy and job market.<br />While soaking the rich might sound attractive, the president’s proposal is more like drowning them. On paper, the president’s proposal would raise the nominal capital-gains rate from the current 20% to 39.6%, plus the ObamaCare 3.8% Medicare surcharge. Many investors who would be subject to the proposal live in places like California and New York City, where the combined federal, state and local tax rates would reach 56% and 58%, respectively. Capital-gains taxes on corporate shareholders are already a double tax, since income is taxed at the corporate level before being remitted to shareholders. The total federal, state and local income taxes paid by corporations and shareholders on corporate income would be as much as 75% under the Biden proposals.<br />That’s all before inflation. Capital-gains taxes apply to nominal returns. If you bought a stock decades ago for $100 and sell it today for $1,000, you’ll pay taxes on the $900 profit, never mind that a substantial part of it reflects the dilution of the dollar’s value. As inflation accumulates, savers’ assets are driven up in price. But inflation-induced appreciation doesn’t raise real wealth, which erodes as these phantom gains are taxed. This problem, which exists in the current tax code, could be solved by indexing the basis on which the gain is calculated—in our example, revaluing the $100 purchase price in 2021 dollars before calculating the profit.<br />For the past 20 years, the nominal average annual total return on the S&P 500 index has been about 8.6%. If this continues in the future and the Federal Reserve succeeds in hitting its 2% inflation target—an optimistic prospect, given wildly excessive fiscal policies this year—total real returns, after inflation, will be about 6.6%. A 58% tax rate on an 8.6% nominal return is the equivalent of a 76% tax on after-inflation returns of 6.6%. An investor would keep less than a quarter after-inflation gain.<br />This risk calculus looks even dicier considering how the Fed has defined inflation. The central bank’s definition—the price index on personal-consumption expenditures—includes services the government pays for, like Medicare reimbursements to doctors, which have nothing to do with what Americans pay for out of their own pockets. The consumer-price index, which relates more directly to what consumers pay for themselves and what Americans intuit as the cost of living, tends to run about 0.4 points above the Fed’s inflation measure. Using this more realistic understanding of the cost of living, the real marginal tax rate would be about 80.5%.</td>

But Iran’s behavior during the interregnum shows what it thinks about President Biden’s arms-control overtures.<br />Federal prosecutors said last week that an Iranian intelligence network planned to kidnap a U.S. citizen in New York and bring her to Iran. A dual U.S.-Iranian national, Masih Alinejad has reported extensively on human-rights abuses by the Islamic Republic. The journalist has built a large following on social networks while pushing for a tougher American approach to Tehran.<br />The prosecutors, who indicted four Iranian nationals, said Iranian intelligence has targeted others in Canada, the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Last year Tehran executed Ruhollah Zam, a France-based Iranian exile abducted while traveling in Iraq. Europe has previously imposed sanctions on Iran for planning terrorist attacks and murders on the Continent.<br />Meanwhile, Reuters reports that an Iranian commander has encouraged Iran-backed militias to step up attacks on U.S. targets in Iraq and Syria. Shiite militias have attacked U.S. positions in Iraq at least 26 times since President Biden took office, estimates Behnam Ben Taleblu of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Mr. Biden ordered retaliatory airstrikes on the armed groups twice this year. But two American service members were wounded this month during a rocket barrage after the last pinprick U.S. retaliation.<br />Iran’s violations of the 2015 nuclear deal also continue. Lame duck President Hassan Rouhani says the country can enrich uranium to weapons-grade purity, or about 90%. So far it has stopped at 60%, but that’s well above the 3.67% allowed under the deal. The government is stockpiling other illicit material and ignoring its inspection obligations to the International Atomic Energy Agency.

These numbers don’t count those who cross illegally and aren’t caught, and they mask the human exploitation of migrants by the cartels that control border crossings.<br />The migrants keep coming despite the vocal pleading of Biden officials because migrants perceive the benefits are worth the risk. The Biden Administration is expelling adults under a pandemic-era emergency policy. But news reports say it is considering an end to that policy, which means migrants would be able to seek asylum and remain in the U.S., often with permission to work, while they wait for their cases to be heard. That can take years given the backlog, and many will never show up in court.<br />No wonder so many pay the cartels and take their chances on the trek through Mexico rather than stay in Central American countries with little economic opportunity and no rule of law. Apparently America’s “systemic racism” isn’t as awful as the Biden Administration claims. But the surge of migrants is a growing political crisis for Democrats, whose failure to fix the broken incentives is costing them support, including among Hispanic-Americans in the border counties of Texas.</td>

      <td>Technology exists to restore the internet if Biden is willing to use it.</td>
      <td>Despots have often sought to crush democratic uprisings by shutting down the internet. Cuba’s Communist government did so last week, but President Biden can leverage U.S. technology to tear down Cuba’s cyberwall.<br />As anti-government protests spread last week, Havana restricted access to social media and messaging platforms, limiting communications on the island and hiding its brutal crackdown from the world. Repressive regimes can be expected to resort to internet controls more often if they aren’t forced to pay a price.<br />Iran shut down the internet for a week in November 2019 amid its violent crackdown of protests over rising fuel costs. Former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak regime’s ordered internet providers to disconnect all users in 2011 as unrest swept his country. Myanmar shut down the internet for more than 19 months in regions with ethnic conflict and persecuted Muslim minorities.<br />Mr. Biden told reporters his Administration is “considering whether we have the technological ability to reinstate that access” in Cuba. The U.S. does have that ability, though it won’t be without logistical challenges. The question is whether the Administration has the political will to do it.<br />Some Cubans have been using a censorship-circumvention tool known as Psiphon to access websites, though connectivity is slow and not secure. Another technology the U.S. could deploy is high-altitude balloons that float in international airspace. Google pioneered the technology with its startup Loon, which aimed to connect remote and rural areas of the developing world. Tennis-court-size aerial balloons function as self-navigating wireless cell towers that can deliver mobile internet coverage over more than 4,000 square miles.</td>

      <td>Killing of 6-year-old girl, evacuation of Nationals stadium among rising number of gun incidents in D.C.</td>
      <td>Two high-profile weekend shootings in Washington—one killing a 6-year-old girl and another prompting the evacuation of the Washington Nationals ballpark—put a spotlight on rising gun crime in the nation’s capital and some U.S. cities.<br />In the District of Columbia, the number of assaults involving a gun has increased year over year since 2018 and is higher this year so far than at the same point in 2020, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from Washington, D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department public portal.<br />Through this weekend in the District of Columbia, 455 assaults involving guns had been reported, compared with 422 through mid-July 2020, police data shows. The category of assaults includes any use of a gun in the incident and isn’t limited to shootings. Specific data on shootings wasn’t readily available Sunday.<br />The higher rates of gun crimes mirror trends in other cities such as New York, Philadelphia and Chicago, where shootings are up compared with this point last year and homicides are rising or are near high levels seen last July.<br />“This is a pretty national phenomenon,” said David Abrams, an economist and law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, who studies crime. He said the jump in shooting and homicides in many large cities started in mid-2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic but researchers are still sifting through the data to isolate specific causes.</td>

      <td>Lawmakers, White House move to finish $1 trillion plan by midweek</td>
      <td>Lawmakers dropped plans to pay for a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure package in part by boosting tax-collecting enforcement at the Internal Revenue Service, a setback for the bipartisan measure ahead of a looming deadline for agreement.<br />The shift came after pushback from Republicans who were wary of granting the agency more money and power, Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), one of the lead negotiators, said Sunday on CNN. Legislative aides from both parties confirmed the move.<br />The change means that the plan to strengthen the IRS to do more to collect taxes owed but not collected—a priority for President Biden—has stalled, at least for now. But lawmakers say it could be revived elsewhere, in a separate spending package pushed by Democrats.<br />Unknown on Sunday was whether or how quickly lawmakers would be able to coalesce around a new source of revenue. But the decision to exclude the IRS provision means lawmakers will have to scramble to replace it to complete the infrastructure package before a midweek deadline, and it casts new uncertainty over the talks.<br />Republicans and Democrats have spent weeks trying to negotiate an infrastructure deal, including funding for roads, bridges and broadband. But they have struggled with how to cover the cost without increasing the federal deficit, which has risen to record levels over the past few years because of tax cuts and pandemic-related spending. They have said the plan will be fully paid for with new revenues.</td>

      <td>The long-feared possibility that the Covid-19 pandemic could disrupt the Tokyo Olympics is rapidly emerging as a reality, as Games organizers scramble to deal with a rising load of athletes and officials who are testing positive upon arrival in Japan.<br />The stream of positive cases is quickly demonstrating how difficult it will be to stage one of the world’s largest events during a global pandemic. Tens of thousands of participants from more than 200 countries are entering a country where the vaccination rate of the local population remains low and the more-contagious Delta variant is spreading.<br />Officials have a dilemma that will run throughout the Games. The Japanese public is deeply wary of the Olympics, fearing an outbreak that will spill into the general population. So they are deploying strict rules to limit the risk—which could block athletes from participating if they become ensnared in Covid protocols.<br />South Africa’s soccer governing body said Sunday two of its men’s team members based in the Olympic Village and a technical staff member had tested positive and were being isolated. Also testing positive after arrival was International Olympic Committee member Ryu Seung-min from South Korea, Games organizers said.<br />And on Sunday, the British Olympic Association confirmed that six athletes and two staff members from its track and field team were identified as close contacts of an individual—not from the Team GB delegation—who tested positive following their arrival in Tokyo on Friday. The British delegation members have continued to test negative and are in self-isolation in their rooms at the team’s camp.</td>

      <td>Without the drama of last year’s Tour, the 22-year-old Slovenian took the yellow jersey after Stage 8 and kept it all the way to Paris.</td>
      <td>PARIS—When Tadej Pogacar stunned pro cycling to win last year’s Tour de France as a 21-year-old rookie, he wore the leader’s yellow jersey for all of one stage—the last one. This year, the peloton’s dominant stage racer had more time to savor it.<br />Pogacar stamped his authority on the Tour after barely a week this year and held the lead for 13 stages all the way to a procession on the Champs-Elysées. With a target on his back, he held off attacks in the Alps and the Pyrenees to claim three stages. And by the time he rolled into Paris, his winning margin was 5 minutes and 20 seconds, the largest at the Tour since 2014.<br />“Last year, I was less stressed about everything,” Pogacar said in a press conference before Sunday’s ceremonial stage. “This year is a bit more difficult off the bike but I think it’s more enjoyable. I can enjoy the moment.”<br />In keeping with tradition, Sunday was mere confirmation for the yellow jersey. The real intrigue surrounded the British sprinter Mark Cavendish, who reached Paris with a shot to surpass Eddy Merckx’s mark for career stage wins at the Tour de France.<br />Cavendish had improbably reeled off four victories over the past three weeks to tie the record at 34. But in the frenzy of the final sprint on Sunday, he lost contact with his leadout man, found himself boxed in and missed out on victory No. 35. Cavendish could only slam his handlebars in frustration as he crossed the line. He still went home with the Tour’s green jersey for winning the points classification.</td>

      <td>Ingersoll Rand Inc.  has made takeover bids for component maker  SPX Flow Inc.  that have so far been rebuffed, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The industrial-machinery company’s most recent all-cash offer valued SPX Flow in the low-$80s a share, the people said, or around $3.5 billion. SPX shares closed Friday at $62.09, giving the company a market value of about $2.6 billion.<br />Charlotte, N.C.-based SPX primarily makes components for machinery used by food-and-beverage and industrial companies. Ingersoll Rand, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of industrial pumps and compressors, has a market value of about $20 billion.<br />In 2019, the former  Ingersoll-Rand  PLC, then incorporated in Dublin, agreed to merge with Gardner Denver Holdings Inc. The deal combined Gardner Denver’s selection of compressor, pump, vacuum and blower products and services with the part of Ingersoll Rand that made similar tools and systems as well as equipment for lifting and material handling, and golf carts.<br />The remainder of the company—heating, ventilation and air- and temperature-controlled transport businesses—became  Trane Technologies  PLC.</td>
