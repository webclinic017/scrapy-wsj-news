      <td>Google is resilient, but it isn’t bulletproof.<br />First-quarter results from parent company  Alphabet Inc.  on Tuesday afternoon showed that the world’s largest online advertising company is hardly immune to the pressures being felt by others in the sector. Total advertising revenue grew 22% year over year to $54.7 billion, but still fell shy of the $55 billion expected by Wall Street. The main culprit was YouTube, where ad revenue of nearly $6.9 billion fell about 8% short of the $7.4 billion analysts were expecting. YouTube’s ad revenue also saw substantial deceleration, growing 14% on year in the most recent quarter compared with 25% growth in the December period and 49% growth in last year’s first quarter.</td>

MSNBC host Ari Melber warns that Mr. Musk could hack the political debate by having the website “secretly ban one party’s candidate” or “turn down the reach of their stuff, and turn up the reach of something else, and the rest of us might not even find out about it until after the election.”<br />Uh, hello? Twitter has banned President Trump. A month before the 2020 election, it moved to “turn down the reach” of the New York Post’s reporting on Hunter Biden’s laptop. Those actions weren’t secret, but Mr. Melber’s alarm echoes what conservatives have been saying for years about big tech’s censorship. As long as the usual Silicon Valley overlords controlled all of social media, progressives didn’t mind. But Elon Musk buys Twitter, and suddenly freer speech is a national crisis.</td>

That’s why Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s recent remarks about Chinese power in the Pacific are worth noting.<br />“I share the same red line that the United States has when it comes to these issues,” Mr. Morrison said Sunday of China’s growing influence in the Solomon Islands. “We won’t be having Chinese military naval bases in our region, on our doorstep.” He declined to elaborate on how Canberra would respond if his red line is crossed.</td>

      <td>For much of its history, American society was awash in the biblical ideas, themes, names and gimcrackery—for good and ill.</td>
      <td>Many Americans born after 1960 have trouble imagining that for much of the country’s history the Bible was a chief source of national identity. Older Hollywood directors sometimes get it right. Take “Liberty Heights” (1999), written and directed by Barry Levinson (born 1942). The film explores relations among Jews, blacks and WASPs during the 1950s when Baltimore’s public schools were integrated. In one scene the Jewish son of a burlesque-theater owner watches an African-American girl, the daughter of a surgeon, during their class’s recitation of Psalm 23. They have different takes. He likens it to singing the National Anthem before an Orioles game. She says it provides a brief respite before a busy day of study. Whether ceremonial or therapeutic, Bible-reading in public schools was, by the 1950s, among the last uncontested conventions of America’s Bible civilization.<br />Mark Noll’s “America’s Book: The Rise and Decline of a Bible Civilization, 1794-1911” explains how the Bible achieved this status. The new nation’s rejection of European forms of Christendom such as sacral monarchy and state churches left the Bible to bear the burden of America’s attempt to create a Christian civilization. A completely secular republic was never a possibility except for the most free-thinking of free thinkers. The Founders virtually to a man insisted that a republic depended on a virtuous citizenry, and that the best source of morality was religion. Despite the variety of Protestant denominations, church leaders and public officials agreed that the Bible was the best and most reliable guide for determining moral consensus.</td>

Mr. Musk’s own finances will be in a world of hurt if his Twitter turnaround fails and simultaneously the helium comes out of Tesla’s stock price. So financial realities will work to corral his impulses to some extent. He won’t be ending Twitter’s reliance on advertising, which accounts for 90% of revenue. He won’t be junking the “content moderation” needed to keep advertisers from fleeing.</td>

      <td>A new series on Paramount+ dramatizes the shaky road ‘The Godfather’ took from page to screen.</td>
      <td>Spoiler Alert: “The Godfather” got made. Nonspoiler alert: In “The Offer,” it almost doesn’t. “Godfather” cultists, and we are legion, will find the entire 10-part dramatic series—presented by the studio that almost didn’t make the movie—not just impossible to refuse, but nerve-racking: A world without Francis Ford Coppola’s masterpiece? The film that may well be the crowning achievement of American cinema? Unthinkable. And yet, in the early ’70s, it was very thinkable. In fact, the series more than implies that the film was a series of small miracles from the time it rose out of Mario Puzo’s pulpy novel to the night it won the Best Picture Oscar for 1972. As never happened, Michelangelo might have fallen off the scaffold; Mozart might have been born to a butcher; Ronald Reagan might actually have starred in “Casablanca.” How masterpieces do happen is usually the result of fortuitous happenstance, pitfalls avoided, stupidity sidestepped. “The Offer” catalogs it all.<br />The series, created by Michael Tolkin, carries a very unusual source credit—“Based on Albert S. Ruddy’s experience of making ‘The Godfather.’” Not surprisingly, Mr. Ruddy (now 92 years old) is the hero of the piece, portrayed with heroic nerve and considerable charisma by Miles Teller (“Whiplash”), as the producer who hurdles the myriad human obstacles preventing the Corleone family’s emigration from page to screen: Paramount president Robert Evans (Matthew Goode) is desperate to salvage his struggling studio, but not so desperate that he doesn’t foist his wife, Ali MacGraw (Meredith Garretson), on director Arthur Hiller (Jake Regal) for the lead in “Love Story.” Mob boss Joe Colombo (Giovanni Ribisi) is using his newly formed Italian-American Civil Rights League to convince America that the Mafia doesn’t exist, something “The Godfather” is insisting it does. Charles Bluhdorn (Burn Gorman), head of Gulf+Western (which then owned Paramount), is inclined to go along with the charming Ruddy, though his unctuous functionary, Barry Lapidus (Colin Hanks), is undermining the film at every turn.</td>

      <td>Years ago in a different America, media folk would express concern that a rich guy buying a media outlet might enforce an ideological viewpoint. Now with Elon Musk and Twitter, the media pack is terrified that he won’t. The great fear among the press corps is that the social-media platform might allow all consumer thoughts to be expressed.<br />Perhaps we can thank the failures of university educators for the amazing transformation of U.S. journalists from stouthearted defenders of free speech to its most formidable domestic opponents. The new conventional media view is that the most important challenge facing Twitter is figuring out which theories to suppress and which nonviolent speakers to silence. The idea that one might allow an open forum is now treated by many prominent pundits almost as a reason to call the vice squad. CNN’s Brian Stelter warns:</td>

It would serve American interests to reallocate it in ways that counter Iran’s influence.<br />Lebanon’s politics, including its upcoming parliamentary elections, are in Hezbollah’s grip.

Porn, racial slurs and spam are all protected under the First Amendment, but few users want to see them. Even for the narrow categories of speech that aren’t protected, nearly all content blocking on social media goes against the first principle of free-speech jurisprudence—the ban on prior restraint, or censorship without judicial review.<br />The first step to solving these conundrums is to recognize that different free-speech principles apply in different contexts, and there are three key different kinds of forums. Speech protection is strongest in a “public forum.” If Twitter were such a forum, almost all content blocking would be an impermissible prior restraint. But Twitter isn’t a public forum, most obviously because it isn’t run by the government (even though its censorship is sometimes at official behest). At the other end of the spectrum is private property. If you’re a visitor in someone else’s home, he’s free to kick you out simply for offending him.</td>

For brokerage giant and bank  Charles Schwab ,  this pressure comes in the form of what it calls cash sorting: People take some of their yet-to-be invested cash that is earning very little and move it into a money-market fund or other higher-yielding alternative.

After a speedy love-hate business courtship that lasted two weeks, the social-media website agreed Monday to accept Mr. Musk’s buyout offer of $44 billion.<br />What a gamble for Mr. Musk, who argues he can unlock value in Twitter that its current leadership can’t. According to the Journal, the financing proposal he announced last week includes $21 billion in personal equity. That amounts to roughly 10% of his net worth, going by the Forbes estimate. As collateral on debt, Mr. Musk would also pledge about a third of his Tesla stake. It isn’t every day the world’s richest man makes a bet like this.</td>

One is Moscow’s obsessive pursuit of nationalist and imperial ambitions—unifying the two countries and eliminating a separate Ukrainian identity. The other is Vladimir Putin’s misperception—he is an insulated, overconfident autocrat who misplayed his hand.<br />These theories are surely true, but years of working in and writing about wars have taught me there’s usually more to the story. Whether it’s a world war, a U.S. invasion or a West African rebellion, observers are quick to focus on passions and mistakes and to demonize leaders who launch a conflict. Yet most wars have strategic roots as well, ones that work in concert with passions and mistakes. Ignoring this makes finding a path to peace difficult.</td>

      <td>After losing a union vote in New York, the company accuses the NLRB of bias.</td>
      <td>Amazon is pushing back against the recent union election at its Staten Island facility in a novel way: by taking on the National Labor Relations Board itself, alleging that the NLRB behaved in ways showing bias in favor of the union. In the process, Amazon may force courts to clarify an important ambiguity in American labor law and make the NLRB, the agency charged with overseeing workplace elections, act more neutrally.<br />In the 25 official objections Amazon filed with the board, the company argues that the NLRB’s “interference and mismanagement” prevented “a free and fair election” at its Staten Island facility. Among other things, Amazon alleges that the board arbitrarily excluded some workers from the bargaining unit in which the union had to show 30% support to hold a vote. The company also alleges the NLRB let union representatives distribute marijuana to workers in exchange for votes and intimidate workers opposed to collective bargaining. (The union’s lawyer told the Associated Press that  the intimidation allegation is “patently absurd” and handing out marijuana “is no different from distributing free T-shirts and it certainly did not act to interfere with the election.”)</td>

      <td>The Pentagon needs clarity about its authority, not micromanagement.</td>
      <td>To most onlookers, the U.S. appears to be in the midst of a successful cyber defense campaign against Russia. As Gen. Paul Nakasone, commander of U.S. Cyber Command, recently testified before Congress, the U.S. military is deploying military members to the region to sit “side by side with our partners.” Cyber Command has also “crafted options for national decision makers” and is “conducting operations as directed.” Yet at a pivotal time in Ukrainian cyber defense, the Biden administration is reportedly considering a proposal to take away Defense Department authorities to conduct offensive cyber operations and reinstate a centralized approval process from the White House. This would be a mistake.<br />All departments and agencies within the federal government operate under different authorities, delegated from the president through executive policies and from Congress through law. These define what an organization can and can’t do and when it needs to ask for permission. In a conflict or military campaign, the president (and sometimes Congress) delegates authorities to the Defense Department to conduct operations.</td>

One morning, he appeared in the hallway toting a stepladder. From a leather bag he pulled a stencil set, pencils, a few rags and a small pot of black paint. Balancing his tools as he climbed the ladder, he traced out an inscription on the wall: “Life is not determined by what you want. Life is determined by the choices you make.”<br />The message was at odds with Mr. Seaver’s blusterous style, but I was transfixed. No one before had asked me to consider this notion. I’d been under the juvenile impression the world would always be my oyster.</td>

When stewardesses, as they were then called, began appealing to the newly created Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to challenge the airlines’ discriminatory hiring practices, the airlines fought back, using what was known as the BFOQ loophole in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. They defended their right to hire only women and to fire them if they gained weight, married, got pregnant or entered their 30s, arguing that being a young, thin, single woman was, in fact, a “bona fide occupational qualification” for the position.<br />“It wouldn’t be much of an exaggeration to say that in the 1960s the airplane cabin was the most sexist workplace in America,” writes Nell McShane Wulfhart in “The Great Stewardess Rebellion.” Most passengers at midcentury were male business travelers; airlines believed that having young, pretty stewardesses gave them a competitive advantage. Ms. Wulfhart’s exhilarating account describes how a number of stewardesses, galvanized by the women’s movement, took on the airlines and won.</td>

In the next decade, it also means abating emissions from gas itself.<br />Industry sees this as an opportunity, not a “death sentence.” American oil and gas CEOs have said they see carbon capture as a $3 trillion to $5 trillion industry by 2050. As the country moves to 100% clean power by 2035, American companies lead on technologies to produce emission-free electricity with gas. There are immense job opportunities in the gas industry’s transition to net zero. Don’t take my word for it; look at the industry’s investments.</td>

Respect for patient autonomy is one of the pillars of principle-based medical ethics, and it is considered by many as the most significant because of the value placed in modern Western society on individualism and liberty. Aren’t patients allowed to choose doctors with different opinions?<br />Medical science is ever changing. Today’s contrarian concepts often are tomorrow’s standards of care. Ignaz Semmelweis, the Hungarian obstetrician who introduced hand washing into medical practice, was ostracized. I wrote against such one-size-fits-all approaches as the 39-week rule in obstetrics. Years later, the rule was found to increase stillbirths and other fetal and maternal morbidities.</td>

      <td>Worries about the war in Ukraine, China’s Covid-19 outbreak, a U.S. or European recession and surging global inflation are making a long-spurned asset increasingly popular with Wall Street’s top money managers these days: cash.<br />As stock and bond prices have retreated from records in the tumult of headlines, more asset managers said they are looking to move funds into low-risk, cash-like assets. That marks a shift from recent years, when steadily climbing equity indexes trained investors to buy every dip and not miss out on gains by holding cash.</td>

      <td>‘I am sorry. I got this one wrong,’ Melvin founder Gabe Plotkin writes to clients</td>
      <td>Gabe Plotkin scrapped a plan to start charging performance fees again at his beleaguered hedge fund, Melvin Capital Management, after encountering backlash from investors.<br />Mr. Plotkin on Thursday told clients he planned to shrink the size of Melvin’s hedge fund by several billion, to $5 billion, and resume charging performance fees even though his investors are still sitting on steep losses. Those who had been invested at the start of 2021 have lost 51.8% through March, after a big hit Melvin suffered in January of last year due to the meme-stock rally.</td>

      <td>Will the French President tack to the left or listen to his economic liberalizing instincts?</td>
      <td>French President Emmanuel Macron won a second five-year term on Sunday over Marine Le Pen, and the Western alliance against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine can breathe easier. The question is whether Mr. Macron will do more in the next five years to make France great again.<br />The President is the first French leader to earn a second term in two decades, and he owes his victory in part to the luck of having Ms. Le Pen as an opponent. A political newcomer in 2017, he beat Ms. Le Pen by 32 percentage points while warning of his opponent’s radicalism and vowing to restore French dynamism. Projections Sunday showed a smaller if still decisive 58-42 victory.</td>
