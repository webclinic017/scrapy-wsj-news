      <td>The Court must consider the Constitution and long-time precedent.</td>
      <td>The Supreme Court takes up its most important abortion case in years on Wednesday, and the question will be how the Justices maneuver their way out of a thicket they should never have entered 50 years ago. Will the Court, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, settle for an incremental ruling that upholds a Mississippi ban on abortion after 15 weeks, or will it overturn its misguided precedents and return the regulation of abortion to legislatures in the states?<br />These columns have long supported a policy of legal abortion before viability, albeit uneasily as technology has revealed the development of the fetus. But we have had no hesitation in saying that Roe v. Wade (1973) and its progeny, notably Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), were wrongly decided. Abortion is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution, and its regulation is a classic example of police powers reserved for the states.</td>

      <td>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell finally abandons the word to describe 6% inflation over the last year.</td>
      <td>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell finally jettisoned the word “transitory” to describe today’s inflation, and we suppose it’s better late than never. Asked by Sen. Pat Toomey on Tuesday how long inflation would have to persist before the Fed no longer considers it to be transitory, Mr. Powell abandoned the word.<br />The chairman acknowledged that inflation has long since gone beyond the central bank’s 2% target. He then said that some people define transitory to mean “short-lived.” But at the Fed “we tend to use it to mean that it won’t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation.” He added that perhaps it’s time for the Fed to “retire” the word and “try to explain more clearly what we mean.”</td>

President Biden’s decision to nominate partisan Gigi Sohn to the FCC provides fresh evidence of the Democratic Party’s leftward lurch.<br />Among Mr. Biden’s inner circle, Ms. Sohn’s political tweets no doubt earn nods of approval. “I have Republican Friends—They’re Not All Insane;” “if g-d forbid Trump wins, the only thing protecting our Republic is the Ds taking over the Senate;” “I don’t give a rat if you want to still be a Republican. But if you think @realDonaldTrump is destroying the Constitution and this country, you must vote for @JoeBiden, full stop.” But there is a difference between dime-a-dozen West Wing political appointees and the long-lasting power and influence of an FCC commissioner. Ms. Sohn’s rabid partisanship disqualifies her as a candidate for the FCC.</td>

From there one proceeds to “layering,” in which intermediaries “obscure the original source of disinformation and spread propaganda far and wide.” The coup de grâce arrives with “integration,” the point at which the lie has been so widely propagated that it becomes accepted as truth.<br />Mr. Helberg here isn’t describing the process by which theSteele dossier, concerning Donald Trump’s alleged Russia collusion, deranged American politics for five years. Instead, the author’s purpose in “The Wires of War: Technology and the Global Struggle for Power” is to explain how Russia and China, among others, seek to wage digital war on America and its allies.</td>

The fire of April 15, 2019, that destroyed the mighty roof and central spire has inspired what must be the world’s greatest act of collective cultural philanthropy. Over $940 million has already been collected from donors, some 340,000 in all, from all over the world.<br />What animated them was the promise that the cathedral would be re-created, exactly as it was, which was by no means a sure thing. Days after the fire Édouard Philippe, then French prime minister, declared that the cathedral would be rebuilt in a way “that bears the mark of our time.” Architects took him at his word: One proposal would have replaced the burned-out roof with an airy greenhouse, another with a municipal swimming pool. But if Photoshopped gags are the mark of our time, they had a positive effect. An outraged public demanded that the destroyed portions of the cathedral be rebuilt just as they were. So it was decreed, and early this year the process of selecting oak trees for the roof began.</td>

While there are several programs from which a fledgling cook or baker can actually learn something (“Christopher Kimball’s Milk Street” is a favorite, along with “Good Eats” and “America’s Test Kitchen”), “Baking It,” with its Barry Manilow-inspired theme song, has taken a good bit of inspiration from the beloved “Great British Baking Show,” tossing out the Bakewell tarts, Victoria sandwiches and hot-water-crust pastries in favor of an indigestible combination of heartwarming and snarky, as whipped up by hosts Andy Samberg and Maya Rudolph. Those comical presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins were great on the original “GBBS,” but one didn’t tune in just to see them.</td>

It’s also a film made by her grieving husband. On paper, it shouldn’t work at all. It works measurably better on screen.<br />But Andy Ostroy, the film’s producer and director, is also a widower walking a tightrope, and he does so successfully most of the time. He’s given himself two tasks. One is revisiting the murder of his wife, whose body was found in November 2006 at her Greenwich Village office, hanging from a bed sheet. (The killer was hoping New York City police investigators would dismiss the death as a suicide, which they initially did.) The other is paying tribute to Shelly. To that end, he interviews family, friends and friends who were colleagues—among them Paul Rudd, Keri Russell, Cheryl Hines, Nathan Fillion and, notably, director Hal Hartley, for whom the actress starred in “The Unbelievable Truth” (1989) and “Trust” (1990), films that made both their reputations. Also appearing is Sara Bareilles, who wrote the music and lyrics for the 2015 stage adaptation of “Waitress,” which had its Broadway premiere at the Brooks Atkinson Theater in 2016 and ran there until 2020. (The show’s current revival ends in January.)</td>

Both he and the magazine agreed that he should take a break from writing the column and finish his book. On this particular column, Mr. Kirn ran into conflict with the fact checker, but the fact checker was overruled by the editor and Mr. Kirn’s opinions stayed put.<br />It borders on the absurd for Mr. Kirn to play the martyr to left-wing orthodoxy at Harper’s, since the magazine’s reputation for defending liberalism and criticizing political correctness and “wokeness” is now world renowned. We set a very high standard in this regard: Indeed, the two Easy Chair columnists who followed Mr. Kirn, Lionel Shriver and Thomas Chatterton Williams, have been much tougher on the censorious, intolerant left than Mr. Kirn ever was.</td>

      <td>The chief justice has a chance to protect the Supreme Court, strike a blow for democracy, and overturn bad decisions.</td>
      <td>The Supreme Court hears its most important abortion case in a generation on Wednesday. Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization concerns a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of gestation. That’s more permissive than the laws of nearly every country in Europe. But because it applies before viability, it conflicts with Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992).<br />Roe and Casey have corrupted America’s law and disrupted its politics for decades. Dobbs provides the court an opportunity to end the damage by restoring abortion policy to the democratic processes in the states. Many observers expect Chief Justice John Roberts—wary of overturning precedent and anxious to defend the court from political attacks—to search for a compromise. But his record provides compelling reasons to think he will forge a supermajority of justices to overturn Roe and Casey definitively.</td>

      <td>New variant raises concerns but may still remain vulnerable to current vaccines</td>
      <td>Omicron is the latest variant of the coronavirus to raise concerns about the course of the pandemic in the U.S. and around the world. Here’s what we know so far about the variant first detected in southern Africa.<br />Viral variants are new versions of a virus that arise due to small changes in its genetic code. Over the course of the pandemic, there have been many variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but only a handful of note, including the Delta variant, and, most recently, the B.1.1.529 variant, also known as the Omicron variant. Most changes in the genetic code, or mutations, don’t really affect how the virus operates, but sometimes they can give the virus an advantage and allow it to spread more easily. Variants that are able to spread more efficiently become more prevalent, while others fizzle out.</td>

      <td>Iran got $5 billion, but the world’s poor countries aren’t benefitting from ‘special drawing rights.’</td>
      <td>After a year of deliberation over how best to respond to the economic crisis caused by Covid-19, the International Monetary Fund announced in August a new general allocation of special drawing rights equivalent to $650 billion. SDRs are financial instruments that provide governments that are IMF shareholders access to hard currency. The IMF and World Bank normally impose strict transparency and reporting conditions on how funds may be used.<br />There were clear, negative, upfront consequences to any SDR allocation. SDRs must be distributed in proportion of IMF shareholding. All IMF members, even rogue nations, receive them, so Iran got some $5 billion and Belarus $1 billion. These windfalls undermine international efforts to use economic pressure to change these regimes’ bad behavior. The allocation added more than $17 billion to Russia’s record-high reserves, enhancing Moscow’s ability to absorb any international financial blowback arising from its decisions to choke off European gas supplies and amass troops on the Ukrainian border.</td>
