      <td>The latest version of government price controls is barely better than the first.</td>
      <td>So much for self-reflection after a political drubbing. Democrats are responding to last week’s defeat by rushing President Biden’s spending framework through the House while rewriting it on the fly—and they’ll worry about the consequences later. Consider the latest compromise to reduce drug prices, which will do the opposite.<br />Progressives hope that passing legislation in the name of lower prices will increase senior support for their spending bill. But some House Democrats balked at earlier legislation that imposed draconian price controls that would have killed the incentive for drug innovation. Enter Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, who pieced together an agreement between their party’s warring factions. It should come with a black-box warning.</td>

      <td>How’s this for a self-imposed foreign-policy setback: America’s most important ally in the most important theater of world politics has been without a Senate-confirmed U.S. ambassador for more than two years. The Foreign Relations Committee finally approved former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s nomination to be U.S. ambassador to Japan last week, but he awaits a vote on the floor.<br />The last American ambassador to Japan, Bill Hagerty, was confirmed in July 2017, and the Trump Administration strengthened ties with Tokyo as competition with China intensified. Mr. Hagerty left the post in summer 2019 to run for U.S. Senate in Tennessee, and President Trump’s 2020 nominee to replace him didn’t get a Senate vote before the November election.</td>

      <td>Both parties often mistake voter frustration with the other team for devotion to their own cause.</td>
      <td>Hungry true believers tend to energize political parties, but their habit of putting purity above pragmatism leads to impatience with moderate colleagues. Eventually the young purists cannibalize the majorities they need to govern. As defeat looms, they announce dramatically that it’s their “last chance” to pass historic legislation. They argue that real conservatives or real progressives would accept nothing less.<br />Republicans have been where the Democrats are headed—with absolute power comes absolute overreach. In 2016, Republicans ran the table, winning control of the presidency, House and Senate. While they had control of Washington, many Republicans refused to accept victories they didn’t consider “conservative enough.” But total control of the federal government apparatus is rare. Republicans should have found a way to compromise on the speed and size, not the direction, of their reforms. Persistence and ideological consistency would have been rewarded over time with big, enduring changes moving the nation in a more conservative direction. Instead, Republicans bickered among themselves and went for big victories that either failed completely or provoked electoral backlashes.</td>

Once Mr. Biden signs the bill into law, the true work of fixing our infrastructure will begin.<br />But there is a danger.

Though preoccupied with the cares of office, Mr. Xi still has time for the little people, the Xinhua profile marveled. Mr. Xi “used his own money to help finance the medical treatment of a villager from Liangjiahe.” This paragon of leadership even inspects “pigsties and toilets to obtain first-hand information of people’s livelihood.”<br />On the evidence of this unsigned article, President Xi can check “achieve total control over Xinhua” off his to-do list.

The Culture War Still Works.” On MSNBC Joy Reid claimed that “education” as an issue is “code for ‘white parents don’t like the idea of teaching about race.’ ” Barack Obama planted the seed while stumping for Terry McAuliffe in Richmond, when he accused opponents of campaigning on “phony trumped-up culture wars.”</td>

Her kidneys shut down, and she lapsed into a coma. Nine days after her diagnosis, she was dead.<br />The culprit: the medicine she had been given to cure her. The liquid used to dissolve the antibiotic, it turned out, had poisoned her kidneys. The manufacturer had never tested the product for safety—and at the time wasn’t legally obliged to do so. Prodded by this disaster, Congress passed a law in 1938 mandating the safety testing that might have saved Joan and the 104 other Americans who died from the toxic remedy.</td>

The political authorities’ response may determine whether Iraq has a chance to emerge from endless crisis or is set on a path of Lebanonization—de facto rule by armed militias in the service of a foreign state.<br />No group has claimed responsibility for the three drones launched at Mr. Kadhimi’s residence in the Green Zone, the area where government offices are located in Baghdad. But the affiliation of the perpetrators is not in doubt. Only Iran-supported Shiite militias have the means, motivation and ability to mount an armed drone attack of this type.</td>

The number of new Covid-19 cases has fallen in recent months, but a resurgence this summer, tied to the Delta variant, coincided with a slowdown in hiring and economic growth.</td>

      <td>CURVEBALLS, from the Delta variant to supply chain snafus, may be threatening the holidays. If procrastination or the many disruptions of 2021 mean you’re only now planning a seasonal getaway, consider these five wonderful-in-winter destinations where bookings are still available and room rates won’t break the bank.<br />Intrepid travelers with a thirst for Italy should consider Conegliano-Valdobbiadene, an appellation at the heart of Italy’s Prosecco production, in the province of Treviso. A onetime retreat for Venetian nobility, the area, aka the “Prosecco Hills,” comprises a mosaic of vineyards, rural villages, old churches and castles, and is one of Italy’s most recently designated Unesco World Heritage sites. It’s also strategically positioned: Venice is just an hour’s drive south, while to the north lie the scenic Veneto Dolomites and Parco Nazionale delle Dolomiti Bellunesi—about an hour by car. The stylish ski resort of Cortina d’Ampezzo is about a 90-minute drive from Conegliano. Source your own holiday fizz by visiting local wineries, like Villa Sandi, that open during the holidays (other than on Dec. 24 and Dec. 31). Bunk down at the Villa Abbazia, a Relais & Châteaux hotel housed in an 18th-century mansion and garden complex in the town of Follina. December rates from about $240 a night</td>

It was the video of remote learning that stimulated parents to object to school abuses.<br />For many years our schools have worked to keep parents out of the classroom. Seventy years ago it was accepted practice for parents to come into a classroom to observe. Using the mantra of security, it is now virtually impossible for a parent to see what is being taught in the schools. This must change. School boards grew out of the culture of the one-room schoolhouse. Local citizens erected a school, hired a teacher and then supervised the school. The teacher was brought in as an employee. A return to traditional school-board management is a must.</td>

Both the Los Alamos Hot Dry Rock geothermal energy program and a similar British project in Cornwall were terminated. An attempt to extract energy from the magma under Kilauea Iki within Hawaii Volcanoes National Park also failed. Drilling technologies have improved, but geothermal-energy recovery still depends on hydrology and net energy gain, not loss. Prof. Borden’s argument doesn’t hold water.<br />James Bresee</td>

      <td>Be reassured that whatever you do, the risk is extremely low.</td>
      <td>If you’re agonizing about whether to have your young child vaccinated against Covid-19, be reassured: The risk is extremely low either way. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 42% of U.S. children 5 to 11 had Covid by June 2021, before the Delta wave—a prevalence that is likely greater than 50% today. Of 28 million children in that age range, 94 have died of Covid since the pandemic began (including deaths before newer treatments), and 562 have been hospitalized with Covid infections.<br />Serious complications are so uncommon in this age range that of 2,186 children in the  Pfizer  vaccine study, no child in either the vaccine or placebo group developed severe illness from Covid. Sixteen of the 663 unvaccinated children developed Covid infections, compared with only three of the 1,305 vaccinated ones—an effectiveness rate of 90.7% against infection. Thus it’s safe to assume that vaccinating a healthy child would take his extremely low risk of serious disease and drive it down even lower.</td>

      <td>FOR GRANDMILLENNIALS, thrifters and other lovers of décor, half the fun of hosting a holiday dinner is setting the table. They happily hunt for mix-and-match plates and brainstorm tabletop themes all year round. For other people, the mere idea of a theme is off-putting and overwhelming. We asked a panel of experts to offer some Thanksgiving table do’s and don’ts, and they unanimously recommended restraint. “It’s a mistake to get fixated on the theme,” advised Wayne, Pa., designer Eddie Ross. He’s seen people get overzealous when it comes to turkey motifs, for example—incorporating them on everything from plates to napkins and even littering the spread with gobbler figurines. It can quickly go, he said “from making a pretty statement with, say, one turkey[-patterned] linen on a burlap tablecloth to a turkey tag sale.” Below, eight ideas to bring some merry but elevated design to your feast without going over the top.<br />Don’t build a centerpiece so tall your guests have to part the greenery like a spy in the hedges just to talk across the table. Sara Hillery, a designer in Richmond, Va.,  recommends a low decoration that runs down the length of an extended table. This shallow garland of eucalyptus and dried citrus should keep the conversation welling.</td>

      <td>The famed restaurant survived two global pandemics and now soaring seafood costs. A brief look at its vaunted history</td>
      <td>For the Time Capsule series, we spotlight a cherished restaurant, hotel or landmark that’s changed remarkably little over the years. This week, we visit Grand Central Oyster Bar in New York.<br />WHEN IT opened in 1913, as the main dining room for the city’s new Beaux-Arts transportation hub, what we know today as the Grand Central Oyster Bar was baldly dubbed the Grand Central Terminal Restaurant. Its name was the only prosaic thing about it. Persian carpets covered the floors, cane-backed chairs stood at tables draped in white linen, and a ceiling of vaulted canopies inlaid with sand-hued tiles glistened above electric chandeliers. The sprawling subterranean space dazzled diners arriving or leaving on the Wolverine, the 20th Century Limited and hundreds of other trains that chugged in and out of Grand Central every day. Over the decades the Persian rugs were tossed, the white linen gave way to red-and-white checks and diners sat elbow-to-elbow at counters that displaced many of the tables. Well into the 1960s, deals were sealed in the clubby (and quieter) adjoining Saloon, over lunches of dry martinis and silken oyster pan roasts. But by the early 70s, rail travel was in rapid decline, and the Oyster Bar along with it: The ceiling tiles were darkened from time and neglect, aqua contact paper covered the marble pillar bases, and plastic fish festooned fishing nets that hung from the ceiling. On the last day of July 1974, the Oyster Bar closed. Later that year, restaurateur Jerome Brody takes the helm and the restaurant reopens.</td>

Ron Wyden’s proposed “billionaires tax” on accumulated capital gains got thrown out of the latest version of the massive spending bill—but not before winning the endorsement of President Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. It’s disturbing that they would even consider a plan that would put a stake in the heart of U.S. capital markets, dwarfing whatever benefit it might provide for social programs.<br />American public capital markets have been shrinking for decades. There are half as many public companies today as there were in the late 1990s. The costs of going public and being public are high and being pushed higher by an ever-increasing panoply of disclosure and governance requirements. Although initial public offerings have surged recently, in part because of high valuations and the rise of blank-check companies, Mr. Wyden’s “billionaire” tax would put a quick end to any long-term comeback by imposing, for the first time in U.S. history, a capital gains tax on assets’ unrealized gains. Since the country’s founding any capital gains taxes have applied only when an asset is sold.</td>

There is actually little room to constrain Chinese steel exports to America: China does not even make the top-10 list of foreign steel suppliers to the U.S. Last year, by volume, China accounted for less than 2% of our global steel imports. Blind anti-China policy reflexes can unwittingly result in much ado about (almost) nothing.</td>

Ms. Windsor is executive director of American Family Voices, a “dark money” nonprofit that has for years received much of its revenue from the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD), Internal Revenue Service filings reveal.<br />Yet Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D., R.I.), America’s leading denouncer of “dark money,” has repeatedly cited CMD’s attacks on his enemies and invited its leader to testify before him. Perhaps the senator should investigate his friends’ dark financial ties to this ugly, race-baiting interference in an election.</td>

      <td>“It’s been a long time since” . . . 1971. Fifty years ago on Nov. 8, the album “Led Zeppelin IV” was released, which included the eight-minute classic “Stairway to Heaven.” It was a year of transition from turmoil to modernity, a songwriter’s paradise. And yes, I’m a sucker for anniversaries.<br />Back in 1971 we listened to music on LP records—for the uninitiated, 20 or so minutes of music pressed into vinyl, spun at 33 1/3 rpm and amplified from a scratchy needle to giant speakers. Without TikTok, my generation wasted time poring over album-cover art in search of hidden meaning and reading the liner notes printed on the album sleeves.</td>
