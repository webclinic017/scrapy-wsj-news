      <td>A Russian invasion of Ukraine would be a seminal event that accelerates the new world disorder. The signs have been building for years, but America and its allies are unprepared, as democracies usually are, for the trouble to come. President Biden has a particular obligation to explain the stakes and unite the country as other Presidents have done to meet the challenge.<br />The Biden Administration has done a decent rear-guard job of mobilizing Europe and NATO in opposition to Russia’s designs on Ukraine—despite his blunder in dropping Nord Stream 2 sanctions. The allies are mostly on board the U.S. promise of “massive consequences” if Russia invades, though we wonder how long Germany, France and Italy would stay the course. The weak Western sanctions after Russia’s invasion of Georgia in 2008, and Crimea in 2014, encouraged Vladimir Putin to believe Europe lacks the will to resist with anything serious.</td>

Bloomberg reports that on Saturday all seven U.S. LNG export terminals had tankers docked or loading for the first time, with much of the gas headed to Europe.<br />Demand for U.S. exports helped set a record 13.3 billion cubic feet of gas loading at the LNG export terminals. Demand is so great that regulators have let tankers fill up at the Calcasieu Pass plant in Louisiana, which is still under construction.</td>

      <td>The threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine is shaking up a fragile global oil market, pushing prices closer to $100 a barrel as traders calculate that supplies will struggle to cushion the effect from any significant disruption in Russian fossil fuel exports.<br />Demand for oil has outpaced production growth as economies slowly rebound from the worst of the pandemic, leaving the market with a small buffer to mitigate an oil-supply shock. Russia is the world’s third-largest oil producer, and if a conflict in Ukraine leads to a substantial decrease in the flow of Russian barrels to market, it would be perilous for the tight balance between supply and demand.</td>

      <td>If you can believe it—and at this point you probably can—some people still say the sustained surge in prices across developed economies is transitory. As comforting as that thought might be for Democratic strategists panicking about November’s midterm election, a deeper dive into last week’s awful price data suggests it isn’t true.<br />The 7.5% increase in January on an annual basis is ominous enough. But the important fact is that the current inflation is nearly everywhere, including around the world. The United Kingdom’s central bank expects inflation to exceed 7% this spring and for inflation-adjusted living standards to decline by about 2% this year. Inflation in the eurozone hit 5.1% in January, prompting the perennially dovish European Central Bank to start contemplating an interest-rate increase this year.</td>

      <td>Congressional Democrats are debating which taxes to increase, while the Biden White House is negotiating a world-wide cartel to limit tax competition. But in the 50 states there is a dramatic increase in tax competition to provide the best government at the lowest cost.<br />Economists have long noted the power of interstate tax competition for jobs and investment. In 2021 the 10 states that gained the most residents from domestic in-migration had an average total state and local tax burden as a percentage of income of 7.7%, notably lower than the 9.9% of the 10 states that lost the most residents.

      <td>Getting bogged down in Europe will impede the U.S.’s ability to compete with China in the Pacific.</td>

Many in the American foreign-policy establishment argue that the appropriate U.S. response to any such invasion is a major American troop deployment to the Continent. This would be a grave mistake.<br />The U.S. can no longer afford to spread its military across the world. The reason is simple: an increasingly aggressive China, the most powerful state to rise in the international system since the U.S. itself. By some measures, China’s economy is now the world’s largest. And it has built a military to match its economic heft. Twenty-five years ago, the Chinese military was backward and obsolete. But extraordinary increases in Beijing’s defense budget over more than two decades, and top political leaders’ razor-sharp focus, have transformed the People’s Liberation Army into one of the strongest militaries the world has ever seen.</td>

A synagogue represents our safe and sacred home, and when one is attacked, our entire community feels vulnerable. We testified before Congress last Tuesday about this threat and the urgent need to expand federal funding to protect Jewish and other religious institutions.<br />The federal government already provides some money to protect houses of worship through the Nonprofit Security Grant Program, but it’s not enough for the times we live in. Anti-Semitism is all too common; white nationalism and other kinds of extremism (including neo-Nazism) are spiking; and a growing number of American citizens are drawn to the use of violence to express their political views. A Department of Homeland Security National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin last week warned that the country is in a “heightened threat landscape” that is increasing in its “volatility, unpredictability, and complexity.” Religious institutions of all kinds need to be more prepared in case of violent attacks.</td>

Undoubtedly cupidity was a major factor in the European conquest of Africa, India and the New World, but it wasn’t a major factor in 20th-century history. Hitler, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot, who were responsible for more than 100 million deaths, were driven by dehumanizing ideologies and a lust for power.</td>

Their government, headed by the Liberal Party, has become decidedly illiberal.<br />The truckers, engaged largely in peaceful acts of civil disobedience, call themselves the Freedom Convoy. But they aren’t an organized group with a leader. Some set out from western Canada last month in opposition to a vaccine mandate. Along the way others joined the original pack in person, in spirit—and even in solidarity. On Feb. 8, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported “the tow trucks operators on contract to the City of Ottawa [were] taking a hard pass on requests to haul vehicles out of protest areas, according to the city’s top public servant.”</td>

Tedium, divine and otherwise, is but a small piece of the story. Ms. Havrilesky aims to explore marriage in full: “the feeling of safety, the creeping darkness, . . . the tiny repeating irritations, the rushes of love, the satisfactions of companionship, [and] the unexpected rage of recognizing that your partner will probably never change.”</td>

Indeed, some of the most coveted watches today are those that not only tell time but also tell of someone else’s life and times. Sleuthlike, savvy collectors and dealers track down archival evidence of watches’ provenance, posting the stories online, significantly increasing both interest and value.

Minnesota is very large, about the size of the U.K. While events in the Twin Cities make national news, there is so much more to our state than Mr. Morrow implies.<br />Living about 80 miles southwest of the Twin Cities, I find that Mr. Morrow’s 1973 description of Minnesota is still accurate: “courtesy and fairness, honesty, a capacity for innovation, hard work, intellectual adventure, and responsibility . . . remarkably civil.”</td>

      <td>While I appreciate Andrew Doran’s efforts to raise awareness of anti-Semitism, his argument that “Christians Need to Confront Anti-Semitism” (Houses of Worship, Feb. 4) is outdated and deflects from the real problem. The Catholic Church realized 60 years ago that it needed to confront anti-Semitism, and it did so in the Second Vatican Council. The church eliminated doctrines of deicide and supersessionism, while issuing formal apologies for Christianity’s role in centuries of persecutions.<br />Protestant denominations, especially Lutheranism, have confronted their histories of anti-Semitism, too. U.S. evangelicals may be the best example of the new warmth of feeling that has resulted. Extraordinary progress has been made in Christian-Jewish relations, so much so that the Christian community is now among the Jewish people’s best friends.</td>

      <td>Interior designers push back on five truisms about kitting out little rooms to make them look larger—paint it all white, avoid patterns—and tell you the truth</td>
      <td>DOES A SMALL room decorated like a monk’s cell—white walls, sparse furnishings—really seem larger than it would if adorned more luxuriously? No, say design experts. “Fabric, textures—so often people feel that if they put all this in, it’s going to make [a small room] feel claustrophobic,” said London interior designer Nicole Salvesen, of Salvesen Graham. “It actually has the opposite effect. You’re making [the room] feel more considered, which gives it a grandeur, small or not.” Here, designers debunk this and four other truisms of designing a small room to disguise its size.<br />Truth: A rich color on walls and ceiling fools the eye. You won’t feel closed in, said interior designer Sindhu Peruri, of Los Altos, Calif., because when darker paint is used to dissolve a sense of defined geometry, powder rooms and closet-sized bedrooms will appear larger. Playing down architectural details helps too. Hadley Wiggins, a designer in Peconic, N.Y., said she plays with the perception of a room’s size by painting window sashes and trim the same color as the walls, “allowing the eye to travel continuously instead of stopping on some jarring focal point or moment of contrast.”</td>

On the other hand, when things go wrong, many of those enthusiasts expect OpenSea to enforce rules and compensate people who are ripped off—exactly the kind of role that centralized institutions have traditionally played.</td>

Stella McCartney and Hermès are making “mushroom” leather handbags.

Thus, eco-conscious fashion fans are excited by the possibility of strutting around in fruits, veggies and fungus (yes, fungus). But while these earthy substitutes might seem more ethical than animal products, they come with their own share of problems.</td>

      <td>A mixture of ambition, rivalry, smarts and luck made PayPal an early Silicon Valley success story.</td>
      <td>Next week marks the 20th anniversary of PayPal becoming a publicly traded company. The IPO valued the online payments processor at nearly $1 billion—an eye-opening sum at the time. Back in the day, technology firms marked such occasions with glitzy celebrations. PayPal took a different path. Its youthful employees gathered in the parking lot of their Palo Alto, Calif., office building, where the company’s enigmatic chief executive, Peter Thiel, performed a keg stand and then played 10 simultaneous games of speed chess, winning nine of them.<br />Jimmy Soni tells that story and many others in “The Founders,” a gripping account of PayPal’s origins and a vivid portrait of the geeks and contrarians who made its meteoric rise possible. His richly reported narrative includes corporate intrigue, workplace hijinks, breakthrough innovation and first-class nerdiness.</td>

      <td>The ‘Queen of Flowers’ can carry many symbolic meanings: romantic, political and even spiritual.</td>
      <td>When I type the word “flower” into my iPhone’s emoji engine, the algorithm presents me with a red rose. Since at least the early centuries B.C.,  around the first appearance of a poem once attributed to Sappho, the rose has been known as “The Queen of Flowers.” How, among the garden’s many worthies, did it earn such pride of place?<br />Like the apple, the rose has become a logo—in contemporary culture, for romantic love. The rose that TV’s bachelor or bachelorette hands out, the bud magically preserved in Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast”—these perfect blooms represent a dense bouquet of ideas and ideals. Bette Midler doesn’t sing songs about tulips.</td>

      <td>Is the reign of the hedge fund as business titan a thing of the past?</td>
      <td>Books on current business or economic events that aim for a popular audience usually gravitate toward a now-standard strategy. The “Barbarians at the Gate” technique—inspired by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar’s 1989 book chronicling the takeover of RJR Nabisco by leveraged buyout firm  Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  & Co.—serves up a fast-paced, moment-by-moment account of a spectacular transaction or economic crisis. “Barbarians at the Gate” itself sold tens of thousands of books, as did its worthiest successor in the early 2000s, Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind’s “The Smartest Guys in the Room,” about the fall of Enron. The 2007-09 crisis gave us “Too Big to Fail,” Andrew Ross Sorkin’s 600-page, behind-the-scenes account of bank rescues and the Lehman bankruptcy.<br />Max Frumes and Sujeet Indap’s “The Caesars Palace Coup” brings this technique to the takeover of Harrah’s casino group (later called Caesars), its demise, and its highly contested bankruptcy case. Like other “Barbarians” imitations, it gives the cast of characters at the beginning, a scorecard for the flurry of names to follow, and a detailed index at the end, so that participants can thumb through to see if they’re mentioned. The story gets going when Apollo and TPG, two private equity funds, buy Harrah’s for $90 a share at the worst possible time, the peak of the real-estate bubble, closing the deal in 2008. (Private equity is the new, gentler label for firms like KKR, as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is now known, that were once called leveraged buyout or “takeover” firms; they buy companies using borrowed money, try to whip them into shape and take them public again.)</td>

      <td>A ‘campaign of intervention’ signals a shift in attitude toward a much-used procedure as birthrates drop</td>
      <td>China is stepping up efforts to reduce abortions in young women, signaling a shift in official attitude toward a widely used procedure that has long been part of state-directed family planning.<br />A recent plan by the government-backed China Family-Planning Association outlined a “campaign of intervention” to reduce unplanned pregnancies and abortions among adolescents and unmarried women. It said the aim was to “improve reproductive health.” The plan, posted on the association’s website, was dated Jan. 28 and has been referred to in some Chinese media in recent days.</td>
