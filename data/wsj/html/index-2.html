This is like an engineer saying he merely wants to remove a section of the Hoover Dam. Watch out for le déluge.

      <td>Inflation ate up much of the income gains, which came with greater dependency.</td>
      <td>Among the Biden administration’s favorite claims is that it has cut child poverty in half. True, the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan increased the amount of the child tax credit and made advance payments to those who qualify, putting money into the hands of many poorer Americans. But the size of a government check doesn’t matter so much as what you can buy with it. Doubling your income is worthless if everything you have to buy is suddenly twice as expensive.<br />The advance payments to alleviate child poverty were partly or fully eroded by the higher prices caused by President Biden’s policy trifecta of increased demand, crimped supply and an accommodative monetary policy. This year’s resulting 6.8% rise in the consumer-price index isn’t likely to slow down, particularly since 40% of core CPI is shelter, composed of rent and owners’ equivalent rent. This measure lags behind housing prices, which are booming. The 9.6% gain in producer prices will also eventually will be pushed on to consumers.</td>

The state-run Global Times quoted a manager at a state-owned rare-earth enterprise based in Ganzhou: “The new company will enforce stricter rules on the production quantity as well as the export volume of rare earths, which may also drive up prices.”</td>

But he enters the holiday season facing a series of obstacles that have damaged his political standing and left many Democrats frustrated and anxious about looming midterm elections.<br />The aggressive Omicron variant of Covid-19, following the Delta variant last summer, has driven up infections across the nation ahead of the Christmas holiday, even among those who have been vaccinated and received booster shots. Many Americans are struggling to find available tests, and the 500 million at-home tests the Biden administration has pledged to distribute won’t become available until weeks after Omicron began its rapid spread across the country. The resurgence of the pandemic represents a dramatic reversal from the president’s hopes at the start of last summer that the U.S. would achieve independence from the virus.</td>

      <td>Joan Didion’s literary moment is now in its sixth decade. It began in 1968 with a book of essays called “Slouching Towards Bethlehem” and is still ticking away, with releases of several new volumes of her collected work. Altogether Ms. Didion, now 86, is the author of five novels, 10 books of nonfiction, and a play, with additional credits as co-writer on about a dozen film and television projects. In January, Alfred A. Knopf published “Let Me Tell You What I Mean,” a volume of fugitive essays from 1968 to 2000, and the Library of America has recently printed two collections of her canonical works, from “Run River” (1963) through “The Last Thing He Wanted” (1996). (A third volume of post-2000 material is planned but not scheduled.) As always, the LOA’s omnibus editions are well-upholstered objects, enhanced by excellent chronologies and notes on the texts. The second volume, out this week, contains some of Ms. Didion’s most arresting writing from the 1980s and ’90s, including “Democracy,” a political thriller with echoes of Graham Greene and V.S. Naipaul, and California essays about Patty Hearst and the history of the Los Angeles Times.<br />Ms. Didion’s big subject is atomization: the sense that American culture over the decades has been shattering into pieces, making coherent narratives impossible. In response she developed a writing style—collaged, skittering, rich in eccentric details and wary in tone—that critiqued the societal fracturing she witnessed in tumultuous times and places: San Francisco’s Summer of Love, Los Angeles at the time of the Manson murders, Manhattan during the 1989 trial of the Central Park Five.</td>

McCain and Manchin used to explain their courageous views should inspire members of Congress and the president to follow their example.

Mr. Clayton stifled the crypto industry while in office, yet now he calls for the government to facilitate the adoption of the technology.<br />The director of national intelligence wrote to Mr. Clayton at the time, urging that regulatory certainty would allow U.S. companies to compete against Chinese rivals. A bipartisan group of members of Congress wrote to Mr. Clayton on the same topic, noting the SEC’s crypto posture was “unsustainable.” Former SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest cautioned against taking an enforcement action against my company, Ripple, calling it “highly problematic.”</td>

One must be cautious, however, in comparing scientific and innovative capacity in China and the U.S.<br />Industrial indicators, like total computer or solar-panel production, are important for geopolitics, but they are unreliable, indirect metrics at best for tracking innovation. Comparing numbers of scientific papers or patents is most useful when each place has similar standards. Comparing numbers of STEM graduates is useful when graduates are trained similarly, and when similar proportions engage in similarly advanced research after graduation. The U.S. and China are enormously far from these conditions for comparison.</td>

During this time, police practices varied substantially. Ascribing causality to any one tactic is sophistry.</td>

      <td>The New York City creative, who founded her fashion business in 1981, discusses her eclectic inspirations</td>
      <td>AS A KID growing up in Detroit in the 1970s, Anna Sui knew she wanted to be a fashion designer. She was especially drawn to the colorful designs of Biba, a British brand influential in the ’60s and ’70s. At the London Biba boutique, her mom bought her a teal T-shirt with billowy sleeves along with matching eye shadow. “That was it for me. I’d never seen anything like Biba,” recalled Ms. Sui. “The makeup counter [at the London store] was art deco, decorated with plumes of black ostrich feathers. You were used to seeing blue eye shadow, but these were smoke and maroon and teal and plum, and the clothes were all the same colors with matching boots and matching hats.”<br />Having founded her eponymous label in 1981, Ms. Sui is one of the few independent designers still thriving in New York City, with an e-commerce fashion and beauty operation and bricks-and-mortar stores world-wide. As a gift for the holidays, in partnership with liquor brand St-Germain, she made a floral beaded bottle tote (pictured at her right in the portrait above). In her own experience, however, “I don’t think I would say the best [Christmas gifts] are material,” Ms. Sui said. “It’s more being with my family. I’m really close to them.”</td>

That’s the result of the Biden Administration’s decision on Wednesday to extend its payment moratorium again to May 1.

President Trump extended the pause through January despite no legislative authority to do so. Mr. Biden compounded the injury to taxpayers and the separation of powers by extending it through this September.</td>

The Obama administration, fearing escalation by U.S. adversaries, handcuffed U.S. military cyber operations by requiring executive approval for even small-scale cyberattacks. That reluctance to act meant that when Iran attacked the U.S. financial system or when North Korea attacked Sony Pictures, the administration had few options for retaliation. This restraint was most damaging on the eve of the 2016 election, when the Obama administration reportedly chose not to attack Russian networks despite knowing about disinformation operations from Russian cyber operatives. Some experts have suggested this was because of fears that Russia might escalate in response.<br />The Trump administration veered in the other direction, promising to “defend forward” and “persistently engage” without saying what actions the administration viewed as off-limits for itself and its adversaries. While public reports suggested that the administration conducted some limited offensive cyberattacks, certain senior officials suggested the U.S. wanted to do far more, and the  New York Times  reported that the U.S. even targeted the Russian power grid.</td>

      <td>Henry Ford and Thomas Alva Edison were the twin wizards of the first decades of the 20th century in America. They were paragons of industrial ingenuity and wealth—Ford was the richest man in the country, Edison the paramount inventor—even more renowned than their latter-day counterparts, Elon Musk and the late Steve Jobs. Ford and Edison—accompanied by Harvey Firestone, the tire mogul, and a retinue of servants—would take “camping trips” by car each summer to promote auto sales (and themselves) that were covered by reporters as big news. And in the early 1920s, they collaborated for a time in one of the oddest episodes in the saga of American enterprise.<br />The story of this pair’s vain effort to build a utopian garden city powered by a mammoth hydroelectric dam at Muscle Shoals, Ala., is all but forgotten. Now it’s been disinterred by Thomas Hager, in “Electric City: The Lost History of Ford and Edison’s American Utopia,” a well-researched, crisply written account tinged with irony.</td>

Gasoline used to contain something called MTBE for that purpose, but it may have been causing cancer. The Renewable Fuel Standard law was actually proposed by petroleum producers, who came to me to get them out of that pickle. The credits that some refiners chose to purchase rather than blending biofuels were also their idea to make compliance easier, and the EPA has consistently found that they do not impose significant costs on refiners, as the editorial claims.</td>

Asian-Americans are being targeted to bear the burden of racial remedies, even though their families are more likely to have been discriminated against than to have been part of the discriminating elite. Supposedly progressive elites are robbing a new set of victims to try to make up for past injustices. This is the bank robber hitting a second bank to hand out refunds to the victims of his first bank robbery.<br />Does this even accomplish its objective? Mr. Meyers implies that racial preferences help those who were the victims of prior discrimination. But take a good look at the demographics of African-Americans who get in to Harvard, and notice the high percentage with recent family from the Caribbean or Africa, or family from the upper-middle class. Middle- and working-class first-generation Asian-American kids, whose parents were refugees from communism, are excluded to make spots for upper-class kids of a higher racial caste.
