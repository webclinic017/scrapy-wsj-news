Did the Federal Reserve recently publish one such attack?<br />The Fed’s recent tolerance of inflation in our nation’s currency is disturbing enough. But however misguided the Fed’s monetary policies and bank supervision may be, one hopes that Fed officials are at least attempting to preserve our nation and the vibrant free economy that made the U.S. the most prosperous nation on earth.</td>

For the past week it’s been gas lines as fuel companies struggle to deliver gasoline and diesel to filling stations. The main culprit appears to be a shortage of truck drivers, a common theme in many countries. But it’s worse in Britain owing to post-Brexit immigration restrictions on drivers from Eastern Europe and tax and other policies that discourage those already in the country from staying.</td>

      <td>Four studies—including two from WHO—provide powerful evidence favoring the lab-leak theory.</td>
      <td>Where did Covid-19 come from? The answer can be found in the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself. To get to the truth, we need only unleash the power of science.<br />Based on experience with SARS-1 in 2003 and MERS in 2012, we know that many people are infected by a host animal long before a coronavirus mutates to the point where it can jump from human to human. An extensive data set from late 2019—more than 9,000 hospital samples—is available of people exhibiting flulike (thus Covid-like) symptoms in China’s Hubei and Shaanxi provinces before the epidemic started. Based on SARS-1 and MERS, the natural zoonotic theory predicts 100 to 400 Covid infections would be found in those samples. The lab-leak hypothesis, of course, predicts zero. If the novel coronavirus were engineered by scientists pursuing gain-of-function research, there would be no instances of community infection until it escaped from the laboratory. The World Health Organization investigation analyzed those stored samples and found zero pre-pandemic infections. This is powerful evidence favoring the lab-leak theory.</td>

      <td>If widely used, it would give the central bank unprecedented power over the financial system.</td>
      <td>The Federal Reserve plans to consider the idea of launching a U.S. digital currency. Central bank digital currencies are a hot topic among monetary-policy makers world-wide. More than 80 countries, representing 90% of the world’s gross domestic product, are looking into the technology. But these currencies come with serious risks. Without additional privacy measures, central bankers shouldn’t establish them.<br />You are likely familiar with privately issued digital dollars, such as electronic balances in checking accounts. Central bank digital currencies are similar, except the liability is on the central bank, rather than private banks. One benefit of tying digital currencies to a central bank is that payments would also be processed by central banks, strengthening national and international payments systems and potentially lowering transaction costs. They could also address economic inequality by offering the “unbanked” a way to access the financial system via a direct account with the central bank.</td>

Once at the mercy of hostile foreign governments that used energy supply as a cudgel, the U.S. is now the third-largest energy exporter in the world—a stunning reversal that has driven down prices for American consumers and created more than 10 million jobs in domestic energy.<br />Technological innovation and broad deregulation are responsible for transforming the U.S. into a global energy powerhouse. The development by American oil and gas companies of new horizontal drilling techniques and the perfection of the process of hydraulic fracturing were key elements in this turnaround. Inventing and adding additional energy supply options reduced the need for oil and gas supply to provide for domestic energy uses, freeing more up for exports.</td>

Ms. di Giovanni, an award-winning author, journalist and former Guggenheim Fellow, found new meaning in the traditions of her Catholic upbringing. “Faith meant two things to me: ritual and a sense of belonging,” she writes. “Regardless of where I was in the world, I felt a sense of being part of a larger community, no matter how difficult, dark, or dangerous the situation was.”<br />In the largely secular world of international journalism, it’s refreshing to hear from a correspondent who participated in, rather than merely observed, one of the most fundamental aspects of life in the Middle East: religious practice.</td>

Making its debut with two episodes Thursday night, the show concerns a young couple, Jay and Sam (Utkarsh Ambudkar and Rose McIver), who inherit a rambling, ramshackle, 300-year-old mansion in upstate New York. No strings. No tax burden. Free. “There’s gotta be something wrong with it,” says Jay—at which point we already know enough to chuckle.<br />The “wrong” at the Woodstone Estate, from which Sam’s great-aunt Sophie has recently departed (in what turns out to be a relatively conventional, ascended-into-heaven manner), is the octet of apparitions Sophie has left behind. The souls of the not-at-all-recently departed. They include Isaac (Brandon Scott Jones), a Revolutionary War-era soldier who died an inglorious death (“dysentery was no party”); a flamboyant ’20s jazz singer named Alberta (Danielle Pinnock), who may have been murdered; a sardonic Native-American, Sasappis (Román Zaragoza); a hippie named Flower (Sheila Carrasco); and a cod-obsessed Viking named Thorfinn (Devan Chandler Long). Sophie’s death leaves the fate of the house, and the comfort of its inhabitants, up in the air. What will the new owners do with the place? What will the ghosts do? Rest in peace? Think again.</td>

      <td>EXTREME WEATHER happens so frequently these days that when a vintage is described as “dramatic,” it almost seems commonplace. Happily, in the case of the 2019 Burgundy vintage, the word “dramatic” is coupled to the word “great.”<br />The weather in Burgundy that year ranged from frost to rain to intense sun and extended dry periods. But all was well in the end. Indeed, the Bourgogne Wine Board used the word “magic” to describe 2019—though the same press release noted that the growers were stressed and tense. That struggle made the 12 bottles of 2019 Bourgogne Blanc I purchased to taste seem that much more impressive.</td>

      <td>A murder at a high school has four archetypal suspects in the soapy show based on Karen M. McManus’s young-adult thriller.</td>
      <td>‘The hellscape that is high school,” as someone describes it in “One of Us Is Lying,” is hardly unexplored territory. Several current shows—“Never Have I Ever” and “Sex Education,” among them—are making comedy gold out of exactly that. Other shows have taken darker paths through the winding corridors of lockers and lust. But the question about “One of Us Is Lying”—part Agatha Christie, part Aaron Spelling—is what, exactly, it’s supposed to be: comedy, drama or something else entirely.<br />Based on the young-adult thriller by Karen M. McManus, the show is a catalog of soap-opera conceits that borrow not just from “Melrose Place” or “Dawson’s Creek” but ’30s radio: At one point, a maudlin confession is accompanied by a tinkly piano in a fashion that suggests “The Guiding Light.” It can’t have been an accident. But neither is the rather gruesome death around which this eight-part series is constructed (three episodes drop Thursday, three on Oct. 14, and the final two on Oct. 21). That is the kind of thing that separates it from its ancestors.</td>

Rivkin and Alt often use the present tense when discussing the mandate. This could lead people to believe that a nonexistent mandate carries the full force of federal authority.<br />The mandate’s nonexistence shields the Biden administration from legal challenges that may ultimately restrict the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s authority. Yet the mandate is still effective at compelling industries and companies into compliance, as it leaves room for any eventual issuance to target noncompliant entities. This implied cudgel is particularly effective on industries and companies that are dependent on federal spending or the goodwill of federal regulators. The nonexistent mandate also allows so-inclined state and local governments and companies to issue their own mandates, seemingly in lockstep with Washington.</td>

A lifelong love of education starts in the elementary grades and yet, as I have witnessed with my grandchildren, the hours per week dedicated to teaching subjects that young boys thrive on, like science and history, have been reduced substantially. Those hours have been reassigned to reading and writing, subjects that girls excel in.<br />In addition, the teaching of math has been transformed. Numeric problems have been steadily replaced by word problems, with written narratives required to explain how one arrived at a correct answer—all to the detriment of males’ learning. While knowing how to read and write is critical, boys come to it later in the process. Meanwhile, we turn off their enthusiasm for learning. Who can be surprised by the outcome?</td>

Ms. Tai also, however, also made no mention of scrapping existing tariffs. She did announce a new tariff exclusions process whereby U.S. businesses can apply to skip paying levies in areas where the tariffs are deemed too damaging. Similar processes existed under the Trump administration but expired under Mr. Biden’s.</td>

But reality still hasn’t sunk in enough that they’re willing to kill any new entitlement programs.<br />Their thinking was on display in force on Sunday. Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal told CNN that the left is focused on “what is the way that we can get all of the critical programs that we had identified [child care, paid leave] . . . but perhaps for a shorter period of time, and be able to get then to the number from that.”</td>

His ask was “at least $10 billion of blocked money.” The diplomat added that “they are not willing” to free up frozen funds, and the Iranian foreign ministry later said it was merely an example of a way to build goodwill.</td>

Unfortunately, it has been the dominant belief of the Atomic Energy Commission and now the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, although there was scant evidence of its truth in 1946 and even less now.<br />We now understand how radiation can damage our DNA, which is also damaged constantly due to exposure to sunlight and natural and artificial carcinogens in our food and air. We also know that our cells have no less than five molecular pathways that are active to repair DNA and prevent the development of cancer.

All that is required is bringing a present—your savings or hard-earned income. In return, you will get a lot of cool games, cake and maybe you win a prize. The value of the prize may be equal to your gift, or it may be less or in fact it may be worthless.<br />Mr. Tenev claims that questioning and seeking to regulate investors’ choices insults their intelligence. In this story, regulators are the mean grown-ups. They want to explain the rules of each game and the actual value of the prize: Party poopers!</td>

      <td>I fear we won’t see the likes of the German leader again.</td>
      <td>Regarding “Merkel Says Auf Wiedersehen to a Diminished Europe” (Review, Sept. 25): I disagree with the characterization of Angela Merkel as a risk-averse and tepid leader who had no grand vision for Germany. Clearly her compassion was visionary and courageous. The essay says that in 2015 her government declined to close Germany’s border because of “fear that border police might have to use violence to keep people out.” How visionary and compassionate such a decision looks when compared with the images we saw recently from Del Rio, Texas, and the images we have seen at America’s southern border for years. To pretend the problem doesn’t exist and then express surprise when people, under extreme stress, resort to violence, as our government did, seems cowardly in comparison.<br />I know of no other leader, save perhaps Pope Francis, who has demonstrated by his or her actions, not mere rhetoric, the values that Americans are supposed to hold dear, namely, that “all men are created equal.” I wish that the world had more leaders with the courage to demonstrate compassion and accept all people as equal. I fear we won’t see her likes again.</td>

      <td>OPEC and a Russia-led group of oil producers agreed to continue increasing production in measured steps, delegates said Monday, deciding against opening the taps more widely, and driving U.S. crude prices to their highest levels since 2014.<br />West Texas Intermediate, the main U.S. oil price, rose 2.3% to close at $77.62 a barrel. Brent, the international gauge, added 2.5% to end at $81.26, its highest settling price in three years. Climbing oil prices recently had analysts and economists expecting OPEC and its Russia-led allies to lift production more significantly.</td>

      <td>While companies slowly return to in-person performances, online videos like ‘La Voix Humaine’ and ‘In Song’ continue to bring the opera house to your home.</td>
      <td>While live, indoor opera has returned in cities such as New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles, other opera companies are taking a more gradual approach. Some are waiting until November or even later to perform, and several are presenting concerts instead of staged operas. Opera Philadelphia is opting to wait until January for its indoor return and has announced a fall season of new offerings on its successful streaming channel. Although two of the planned projects fell through, the first, a film of Poulenc’s one act, one-woman opera, “La Voix Humaine,” is now available ($20 for a one-time rental or free with a $99 annual Channel Pass).<br />“La Voix Humaine” is well-suited to film treatment. Based on a monodrama by Jean Cocteau, the 1959 piece delves into the emotional state of Elle (She), whose lover of five years has left her. Over its 45 minutes, their telephone conversation—we hear only her side of it—gradually exposes the rawness of her loss and despair. With its ability to vary location, lighting, angle and focus, the film, directed by James Darrah and starring soprano Patricia Racette, provides an intimate, X-ray perspective into Elle’s internal turmoil.</td>
