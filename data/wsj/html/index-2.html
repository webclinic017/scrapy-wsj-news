      <td>Biden and Trump share responsibility for the looming defeat.</td>
      <td>Former Defense Secretary Bob Gates famously wrote that President Biden has been on the wrong side of every major foreign-policy issue in his long career. The world is getting another example as Mr. Biden’s hell-bent, ill-planned withdrawal from Afghanistan is turning into a strategic defeat and moral debacle.<br />The Taliban march to Kabul continues with the fall of more provincial capitals each day. The last count was 12 capitals, including Ghazni City on the road between the major cities of Kandahar and Kabul. Reinforcing Afghan forces defending Kandahar will become harder if the road is blocked.<br />The Afghan government is trying to mount a counterattack, and President Ashraf Ghani has sacked another army chief. But the Taliban now controls at least eight entire provinces, according to the Long War Journal, and its reach includes areas in the north that the Taliban didn’t control when it ruled the country before 9/11. The city of Herat also fell Thursday, and Kandahar could be next.<br />Many Afghan troops are fighting bravely, but they lack the air support that has been their main military advantage. Mr. Biden blundered in withdrawing all U.S. air power from the country, including private contractors who assist the Afghan air force in maintaining helicopters and planes. The contractors are now literally having to assist via Zoom calls, while the U.S. military flies too few sorties from the Persian Gulf region to slow the Taliban.<br />The White House has failed to understand what’s happening, with leaks saying the Administration is surprised by the Taliban assault. Surprised? The military warned Mr. Biden and so did U.S. intelligence. The Taliban began this offensive on May 1, two weeks after Mr. Biden announced his withdrawal, aiming for the symbolic date of Sept. 11.</td>

      <td>Aerospace company likely will need to remove space capsule for repairs to problematic valves</td>
      <td>Boeing Co. ’s Starliner space capsule launch could be delayed several months as the company will likely need to remove it from atop a rocket for repairs, people familiar with the matter said.<br />Such a delay would be a setback for Boeing’s space program. The company has spent years developing the Starliner and was supposed to launch it late last month to dock with the International Space Station, without crew on board—after a failed attempt a year and a half ago. Ultimately, the capsule is supposed to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station.<br />Boeing engineers have been working to repair a problem with some of the valves in a propulsion system on the Starliner that was discovered earlier this month while the vehicle sat on a launchpad. The company first said it was investigating the valve issues last week, and on Monday disclosed that 13 valves had failed to open as expected during preflight checks.<br />Seven of the valves are working, the company has said, and engineers have continued to try to fix the others. The issue led the company and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to postpone two potential launch dates for the Starliner last week.<br />As teams continued to work on the valve problem, separating the Starliner from the rocket appeared increasingly necessary, according to people familiar with the matter.</td>

On Thursday, she denied the request without comment—and without referring the matter to the full high court for consideration.</td>

      <td>DoorDash Inc.’s  second-quarter revenue almost doubled, showing food delivery’s resilience even as restaurants reopened across the U.S. and people began moving around again.<br />Revenue in the three months ended June 30 was $1.24 billion, up 83% from the year-earlier quarter when nationwide shutdowns because of Covid-19 propelled blistering growth. That came in slightly higher than the $1.10 billion average estimate of analysts polled by FactSet.<br />The pandemic served as an unexpected boon for DoorDash. The company commanded more than half of the U.S. food-delivery market at the end of April, up from just over one-third in late 2019, according to market-research firm Edison Trends.<br />The health crisis made consumers more accustomed to the ease of convenience at the touch of a button. DoorDash expanded into delivering everything from toothpaste to toilet paper and Tylenol during the pandemic. It also expanded its logistics partnerships, delivering orders placed directly on the websites of retailers like  Walmart Inc.  and Macy’s Inc.<br />Continued demand for food delivery, combined with DoorDash’s business partnerships and its expansion into new verticals like grocery and convenience items, led the company to raise its full-year outlook on the value of orders placed on its platform. DoorDash said it expects order value this year to be in a range of $39 billion to $40.5 billion, up from the $35 billion to $38 billion range it forecast just three months ago.</td>

      <td>Americans need to be more tactful and understanding when it comes to measures like masks and vaccines.</td>
      <td>They’re all afraid of their base. That’s the central fact of American political life now, that leaders of all sorts aren’t leading their people but are terrified of getting crosswise with them. They’re afraid of their own fans. This is true of everyone from cable anchors and hosts who know exactly who’s watching and what they want, to presidents of the United States.<br />Joe Biden is afraid of Joe Biden’s base, an extremely important part of which is the teachers unions. He’s afraid to insist publicly, with fervor and commitment, that they get vaccinated and open the schools. He speaks delicately of the unions when he speaks of them at all. It’s clear who’s in charge, who’s going to whom hat in hand.<br />Donald Trump is afraid of the Trump base. His administration pushed, against the odds, to develop the Covid vaccines and bragged, rightly, at the sheer scientific feat of it. He received the vaccine as soon as he could, as did his family and advisers. But he hasn’t led a national charge to overcome vaccine hesitancy; he’s not out there beating the drum to get the jabs. His stray comments have been furtive and low-key. Some in his base resist the vaccine and are angry that they’re going to be pushed around about it. If he put his name behind a campaign to persuade them, they just might push back and say he finally gave in to the swamp. So he dummies up.<br />I think Gov. Ron DeSantis fears his base. He’s shown some guts in Florida the past eight months, pushing back against a kind of National Federal Behemoth Establishment Thoughtblob that was claiming too much power and influence. But now he is forbidding local governments and public schools from requiring masks if they think circumstances justify. This is not conservative but extreme.<br />Eighteen months into the pandemic people have mask fatigue. The subject has become so fraught you have to be either pro or anti, pick a side, no room for an approach that weighs circumstances. Moderation is for the gutless and insincere. But it is reasonable that any power to mandate masks come from the power closest to the voters—local government. No federal power should tell them they must. No governor should tell them they can’t.</td>

      <td>The mask wars are a political distraction. More shots are needed.</td>
      <td>Most of the media and political class are absorbed by the mask debate, but the Food and Drug Administration is keeping the focus where it should be: vaccines. On Thursday the agency was close to approving Covid-19 booster shots for immuno-compromised patients, and more people will need them soon.<br />Vulnerable patients, such as those with cancer or who have received organ transplants, produce a weaker response to Covid vaccines. A recent study found that immuno-compromised patients who received an mRNA vaccine are only 59% protected against hospitalization. Studies have found that a third shot can substantially increase antibodies.<br />Neutralizing antibodies are the immune system’s front-line defense. Vaccines also elicit a B- and T-cell response that can help fight infections, but these immune cells can take longer to kick in for older people as well as when people get rundown. As antibodies naturally wear off over time from vaccination, people will become more likely to get sick with Covid.<br />A study from Israel found that fully vaccinated health-care workers with lower antibody levels were more likely to get Covid. Most such breakthrough infections were mild but 19% had persistent symptoms after six weeks. A recent United Kingdom study estimated that vaccines were only 59% effective against symptomatic illness during late June and early July.<br />A new Mayo Clinic study found that Moderna’s vaccine was 76% protective against infection and  Pfizer ’s  42% in July, versus the 94% to 95% against symptomatic illness in their clinical trials. While both remained 75% to 80% protective against hospitalizations, that still means some who get infected could become seriously ill. The vaccine makers have said they believe people will soon need boosters to juice their antibodies.</td>

      <td>Britney Spears’s father said in a new court filing he would step down at some point from the helm of the controversial conservatorship that has governed the pop star’s personal life and roughly $60 million estate for the last 13 years.<br />The court documents, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Thursday, come weeks after the 39-year-old star asked a judge presiding over the case to remove her father, James P. Spears, calling the conservatorship “abusive.”<br />A new lawyer for Ms. Spears, Mathew Rosengart, has moved aggressively in recent weeks to remove or suspend Mr. Spears. It is part of a broader effort to terminate the conservatorship over Ms. Spears, an obscure legal arrangement that has been in place since 2008 when it was instituted for her protection due to mental-health issues and potential substance abuse. Ms. Spears acknowledged its necessity at the time.<br />Mr. Spears maintained that there are “no actual grounds for suspending or removing” him, but said that he “does not believe a public battle with his daughter over his continuing service as her conservator would be in her best interests."<br />“There are no urgent circumstances justifying Mr. Spears’s immediate suspension,” the filing states. “It is highly debatable whether a change in conservator at this time would be in Ms. Spears’s best interests.”</td>

      <td>A new study shows how the Biden plan would hurt U.S. firms.</td>
      <td>We know this doesn’t fit the political times, but surely someone on Capitol Hill must care about what the Biden Administration’s tax plans will do to the U.S. economy. Some economists are starting to do the work of figuring this out, and the results are alarming.<br />The most comprehensive effort to date at modeling the consequences comes from the Tax Foundationin a report released Thursday. The policy shop taps data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and Internal Revenue Service to develop a granular picture of the global activities of U.S. companies in different industries. This lets it estimate how various tax provisions would hit those companies.<br />The report’s headline conclusion might please progressives, since the Tax Foundation finds the corporate tax increases would generate additional revenue over the next decade. President Biden’s full plan to increase the domestic corporate tax rate to 28% and raise taxes on profits earned overseas might bring in $1.37 trillion over 10 years. A scaled-back version of this plan proposed by Sen. Ron Wyden and other Democrats might fetch $580 billion.<br />But look closer and even progressives should worry. The major problem is international competitiveness. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen spent her first months in office signing up for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s plan for a 15% global minimum corporate tax. The goal is to narrow the gap between lower taxes abroad and the much higher taxes the Administration wants to impose on U.S. companies’ foreign earnings.<br />The Tax Foundation warns this ploy won’t work. Since the 2017 tax reform, the U.S. imposes a minimum tax on American firms’ foreign profits (known by its acronym, Gilti, with an effective rate of about 13%). Overhauling Gilti to resemble the OECD plan—setting the rate at 15% and following the OECD’s standards on exemptions and deductions—would amount to a $137 billion tax hike on U.S. companies over 10 years.</td>

      <td>The soft bigotry of low progressive expectations for minority students.</td>
      <td>Why didn’t we think of that? Politicians and school officials in Oregon are embarrassed that too many minority children fail tests designed to confirm they’ve mastered the “essential skills” that high school is meant to teach. So in the name of racial equity, they’ve now done the progressive thing. Instead of lifting graduation rates by boosting student performance, they’re eliminating the proficiency requirement.<br />Gov. Kate Brown signed the bill on July 14, but the Oregonian reports her office never issued a press release and the bill was not entered into the legislative database until two weeks later—a “departure from the normal practice” of entering bills the same day they are signed.<br />The Secretary of the Senate blamed the delay on a staffer experiencing medical issues. But it’s hardly surprising that Gov. Brown and the Democratic Legislature would not wish to draw attention to this attempt to dumb the state down.<br />The new law extends until 2024 a temporary suspension of the state requirements that kids demonstrate proficiency in reading, writing, and math to graduate from high school. Previously, in addition to demonstrating proficiency via Oregon’s Assessments of Knowledge and Skills test, students had the option of taking other standardized tests or submitting a work project to teachers. The new legislation gives the state’s Department of Education until 2022 to write new standards.<br />The purpose of public education is to provide students with the skills they need to succeed in the world. It is a terrible disservice to issue a diploma that fools them into believing they’ve mastered basic skills they haven’t. It is particularly cruel for the minority students who will pay the highest price when the real world confirms that their high schools have defrauded them of a real education.</td>

      <td>Forty years after the 1981 tax cuts, America needs to relearn the lessons of the supply-side revolution.</td>
      <td>Friday marks the 40th anniversary of Ronald Reagan’s first tax cuts—arguably the most consequential and controversial economic policy paradigm shift of the past half-century. The Reagan supply-side revolution went global. An analysis by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found that the unweighted average top marginal income-tax rate among developed countries fell by a third, from 65% to 43%, after 25 years. Nearly every nation, from China to Costa Rica, imposes lower tax rates today than in the 1970s.<br />Alas, the U.S. needs to relearn the lessons of the Reagan tax cuts. President Biden has proposed a sweeping tax-policy reversal that would raise many tax rates—such as the capital-gains and death-tax rates—to levels even higher than in the Jimmy Carter years.<br />The U.S. economy was a wreck when Reagan took office, due to the combination of tax rates that rose to as high as 70% on some types of income and an inflation rate that hit 14% in 1980. The “misery index” (inflation plus unemployment) closed in on 22%, as a new gloomy term appeared in the economic lexicon: “stagflation.”<br />The Keynesian Democrats were out of ideas. The dean of liberal economists, Paul Samuelson, glumly advised that the only way to break the back of inflation was to tolerate another decade of very high unemployment. Reagan dismissed the austerity model and carried the banner of supply-side optimism. Borrowing from the young Rep. Jack Kemp, economists Robert Mundell and Mr. Laffer (one of the authors of this article) and these pages, Reagan persuaded Americans that the remedy to the decadelong malaise was to reduce the drag of regulatory and tax policy to encourage more work and production.<br />Lower tax rates, Reagan predicted, would reduce unemployment and help stabilize prices. This revolutionary concept wasn’t an easy sell even in the Republican Party. Many Republicans, including Sen. Barry Goldwater, had voted against the tax-rate cuts President John F. Kennedy advanced, and when Reagan proposed the idea, George H.W. Bush ridiculed it as “voodoo economics.” The Republican Senate leader, Howard Baker, called the policy a “riverboat gamble.”</td>

      <td>In Wisconsin, burgers are back. Butterflies will have to wait.</td>
      <td>The 200-pound hamburger is poised to make its triumphant return in Seymour, Wis., this weekend. Twenty miles south, in Appleton, the community’s annual summer release of butterflies has been postponed until next year.<br />In those two towns, both part of eastern Wisconsin’s Outagamie County, you can find, in miniature, the quandary being faced by townships and villages across the country. In a nation that has for a year and a half been rocked by Covid, people of goodwill are struggling to do the right thing for their citizens as the warm season of beloved summer festivals rolls on.<br />In some cities there’s a yearly corn festival; others honor blueberries or peaches or cherries. All the gatherings are intensely local, with one goal: to bring the people of the towns together, shoulder to shoulder.<br />Last year many festivals went away, and with them the chance to celebrate the concept of community. But Seymour’s chief historian, Bill Collar, told me the decision has been made: This weekend the 200-pound burger will again be grilled and split into 800 quarter-pounders for festival-goers.<br />Seymour prides itself on being the town where the hamburger was invented. Several other places make the same claim, but allow me, as someone who has spent time in Seymour, to advise you: Don’t argue with the townspeople about it. The story is that a 15-year-old boy named Charlie Nagreen—in an ox-driven wagon, no less—made his way to the Outagamie County Fair during the summer of 1885. He hoped to earn some money by selling hot meatballs. But they resisted, because the meat was so messy in their palms. Thus, legend has it, Charlie got the idea to flatten the meatballs and put them between pieces of bread, and the hamburger sandwich was born.</td>

      <td>The family members who own OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP required broad legal releases extinguishing opioid lawsuits against them as a condition for funding what became a roughly $4.5 billion settlement proposal, a company director testified Thursday during a bankruptcy trial examining the deal.<br />John Dubel, a restructuring specialist who joined Purdue’s board months before it filed chapter 11 in September 2019, said the Sackler family members who own the company required third-party releases as a prerequisite for a settlement so they would “be able to put all of the litigation behind them.”<br />Mr. Dubel’s testimony came during the first day of a bankruptcy trial in New York over the settlement and Purdue’s broader chapter 11 plan, which would fund opioid abatement programs. He described the discussions while answering questions from a lawyer for Connecticut, where Purdue is based and one of a handful of states opposing the plan.<br />The inclusion of legal immunity for the Sacklers, under nonconsensual third-party releases, is being challenged in the bankruptcy case by federal and state authorities. These legal releases have also drawn newfound scrutiny from Congressional Democrats.<br />If U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain approves the releases, civil claims against the Sacklers would be extinguished even if a minority of creditors and some states oppose the family’s settlement offer.</td>

      <td>A theologian’s talk on the Christian view of sex was deemed a ‘content violation.’</td>
      <td>Carl Trueman is a distinguished scholar, bestselling author and ordained Presbyterian minister. On Aug. 7 he gave a series of talks to the Sacramento Gospel Conference, live-streamed on the YouTube channel of Immanuel Baptist Church. Twice during the event, the live broadcast was booted off the air. Viewers were informed that the first interruption was due to a copyright violation, possibly the result of Christian music that the conference organizers played during a break. But in the second, more mysterious instance, Mr. Trueman’s presentation went dark because of a “content violation.”<br />Was this an intervention by a human being or an algorithm on automatic pilot? Neither Mr. Trueman nor Immanuel Baptist has been told. Equally unclear is the specific nature of the alleged content violation. Nothing in Mr. Trueman’s talks encouraged hatred, vulgarity or violence. On the contrary, he offered a thoughtful analysis of American cultural attitudes toward sex through the lens of classic Christian thought, citing sources from Freud to the philosophers Rousseau and Charles Taylor.<br />Mr. Trueman is understandably worried that religious speech is being censored online. So are many other religious believers. And for good reason: We sense that the First Amendment guarantee of religious liberty is being dismantled, and with it the profound contributions that religion makes to American unity and self-government.<br />Today’s sexual politics function as a new kind of fundamentalism, one that presents a deep problem to a diverse and democratic society. Instead of encouraging the dialogue of democratic process, the fundamentalists seek to impose their own rigid certitude unilaterally. On matters ranging from foster care and education to gender ideology and the family, this new fundamentalism is displacing the moral convictions that once grounded U.S. culture. The result isn’t a more compassionate and liberal society; it’s a more punitive one.<br />Social media enables the new fundamentalism, enforced by the mysterious rules of Big Tech’s quasimonopoly. On public sidewalks, the First Amendment still theoretically protects free speech. In the new public square of the internet, power displaces liberty and conscience.</td>

      <td>Wheeled vehicles profoundly changed cities—their economies, their design, their hygiene. Innovations in transport continue to do so today.</td>
      <td>Tom Standage, the deputy editor of the Economist and one of our best writers of nonfiction, has cultivated a special niche: exploring the history of technology with an eye on both the past and the future. When he finds the right subject—such as the roots and repercussions of digital communication in his 2013 book “Writing on the Wall”—his work is both thought-provoking and scintillating. “A Brief History of Motion: From the Wheel, to the Car, to What Comes Next” isn’t quite in the class of its predecessor, but like all of Mr. Standage’s books, it is rewarding: the product of deep research, great intelligence and burnished prose. Moreover, he always comes up with offbeat and intriguing facts that I, for one, never knew.<br />Being conscientious to a fault, he starts his story with the advent of the wheel. It was developed around 3500 B.C., probably in Eastern Europe. Five thousand years after it was perfected there remained regions—Africa and the Middle East, to name two—where it was eschewed for various reasons; nevertheless, wheels changed the world. Chariots appeared near the Black Sea around 2000 B.C., eventually becoming “a transformational technology on the battlefield,” courtesy of the Hittites.<br />The chariot’s progeny became weapons in the battle for social importance. In 16th-century Europe, “coaches rapidly became status symbols and ‘coaching’ (driving for pleasure in a coach) emerged as . . . a means of showing off, among people wealthy enough to own one or more coaches.” Mr. Standage explores the tortuous symbiosis between wheeled transport and cities, which began in Europe in the 17th century. Urban alterations implemented in that era benefited coaches and their wealthy owners. “Streets were widened and straightened to ease the passage of coaches,” Mr. Standage writes, “and new cities were laid out with broad straight avenues.” Another innovation was the creation of parks, where the rich could preen and flaunt their “fancy vehicles.” Hired vehicles for paying passengers—the horse-drawn omnibus, for instance—first appeared, in France and elsewhere, only around 1820. The arrival of railroads, soon after, hastened the possibilities of mobility for everyone, not just the elites.<br />Wheeled vehicles profoundly changed cities, sometimes in manifestly ghastly ways: Horse-drawn conveyances engendered a serious problem, their ubiquity turning cities into huge outdoor latrines. To the rescue (so it seemed) came the automobile, whose discharges were believed to be much preferable to those of horses. Alas, little did the early car enthusiasts know.<br />At the outset, the auto wasn’t destined to be gas-powered. In 1897 electric cars outsold gasoline- and steam-powered cars. But these models used batteries that needed frequent, lengthy charges. (Electric-car batteries are an issue even now: Mr. Standage offers a lucid assessment of the lithium-ion battery, considered by many of today’s experts to be the probable salvation of the electric vehicle.) In the pivotal rivalry between electric batteries and the internal-combustion engine (pioneered in Belgium in the 1850s and later refined in Germany), the latter won out.</td>

      <td>AUSTIN, Texas—More school districts in Texas are pushing back against an executive order banning mask mandates, joining districts in other states filing lawsuits over the issue.<br />With most public schools in the country set to begin classes in coming weeks, city and county officials are wrestling with decisions about whether to require masks as the highly-contagious Delta variant causes a surge in Covid-19 cases. The federal government recommends their universal use, but most states have left policy creation to local school boards.<br />Several states have banned mask requirements. In some of them, local officials are filing lawsuits against state governments for the authority to make those decisions for local schools.<br />A group of six districts, most of them in the Rio Grande Valley, filed suit Thursday against Gov. Greg Abbott, arguing that he doesn’t have the authority to stop them from requiring masks on their campuses. Kevin O’Hanlon, the attorney representing the group, said schools typically have authority to operate and issue regulations over their own facilities. The districts believe a lack of masks will harm in-person teaching and continuity, as rising infections cause absences and interruptions.<br />“It seems to me [that the governor] is trying to use a disaster declaration to prohibit anybody from responding to the disaster…which is odd,” Mr. O’Hanlon said.</td>

      <td>A creative solution—and a new portmanteau word—for meals enjoyed in parklets and parking places</td>
      <td>In cities across the country, restaurants have survived the pandemic by getting creative with outdoor dining. Many have set up seating in spaces previously dedicated to vehicles, such as street-side parking spots. Since last year, these novel dining areas have swiftly become a permanent part of the urban landscape—and just as swiftly, a name for them has entered the lexicon: “streatery.”<br />“Streatery,” sometimes spelled “streetery,” blends “street” and “eatery,” compactly conveying the new dining configuration in a single portmanteau word. The term has its detractors, who consider it ungainly. “The fact that the already unfortunate word ‘eatery’ has evolved into ‘streetery’ to indicate outdoor patio seating makes me weepery,” tweeted Kara Baskin, who writes about food and parenting for the Boston Globe. Lauren Girardin, a San Francisco-based communications consultant, had a more extreme reaction: “Kill the word ‘streetery’ with fire and bury it in hallowed ground.”<br />On the positive side, Andrew Silverstein, a New York writer and tour guide, observed on Twitter, “‘Streeteries’ may be my favorite word born of the pandemic.” But the word actually has roots predating the advent of Covid-19.<br />While “street” dates back to the earliest records of Old English (having entered Germanic languages from Latin “strata,” meaning a paved road), “eatery” is a much newer addition, cropping up in American use around the turn of the 20th century. As an alternative to “restaurant,” “eatery” found favor among journalists and writers of advertising copy but seldom enters everyday conversation. The fact that “eatery” still has a somewhat unnatural air to it may help explain the resistance some have to the “streatery” spinoff.<br />Both the “streatery” and “streetery” spellings first started appearing in punny restaurant names nearly forty years ago in Atlanta. In 1982, the Peach Streetery opened on the city’s Peachtree Street, and two years later, the 14th Streatery appeared on 14th Street, naturally enough.</td>

      <td>The Department of Veterans Affairs won’t cover  Biogen Inc.’s  new Alzheimer’s drug, the latest rebuke of the controversial treatment since it was approved earlier this summer.<br />The VA decided not add the drug, called Aduhelm, to its formulary list of available medicines because of the drug’s risk of causing serious side effects and a lack of evidence that it improves cognitive function, an agency spokeswoman said.<br />The VA provides medical benefits to more than nine million veterans, and is the largest integrated healthcare system in the U.S. The agency is known for being a shrewd customer of prescription drugs, using its large purchasing power to haggle steep discounts from manufacturers. By law, the VA has greater leeway than other government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid to deny coverage of medicines it deems to be of poor value.<br />Last month, a research paper by a group of VA doctors and scientists identified more than 150,000 veteran beneficiaries diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and estimated that the drug could cost the VA more than $4 billion annually, plus additional spending on associated care such as screening tests and imaging scans. The paper hasn’t yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal.<br />The VA’s rejection comes as Biogen seeks to persuade health insurers to cover the medicine and push back against critics who have cast doubt over its effectiveness and value.</td>

It comes in response to the rapidly deteriorating security situation, and the recognition that the Taliban’s sweep of a number of provincial capitals is at present irreversible and threatens the seat of the internationally recognized Afghan government.<br />The decision to reduce the size of the embassy and send thousands of U.S. troops to the region to do it amounts to a remarkable turnaround for the Biden administration, which has publicly expressed confidence in Afghan security forces even as those forces melted away and the Taliban took over districts and provincial capitals. Only a week ago, the administration anticipated that it would maintain an enduring diplomatic presence to assist the Afghan government to counter the Taliban.<br />On Thursday, the Taliban conquered western Afghanistan’s main city of Herat and edged close to capturing the southern city of Kandahar, as Afghan police arrested the governor of the strategic Ghazni province for surrendering its capital city to the insurgents earlier in the day.<br />The accelerating Taliban victories have demoralized Afghan government forces and sown fears in Kabul that it is only a matter of days or weeks before the insurgents mount a large-scale attack on the nation’s capital, home to six million people. The militants have taken over the capitals of at least nine of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces and taken control of more than half of the roughly 400 districts, which are similar to U.S. counties, across the country.</td>

      <td>Jennifer Hudson leads the star-studded cast in this new biopic about the Queen of Soul</td>
      <td><br />The good news about the Aretha Franklin biopic “Respect” is that its star, Jennifer Hudson—whose voice is usually the musical version of the U.S. Women’s Gymnastics Team (spinning, bouncing, straining, vaulting)—reins it in as the Queen of Soul while still giving a great singer her due. Sometimes, Ms. Hudson delivers what are near-verbatim performances of Franklin’s bigger hits, which not only shows enormous respect but, in Ms. Hudson’s case, enormous restraint.<br />Musically, the movie is solid: The scenes with the Muscle Shoals studio musicians with whom Aretha creates her first real hit—after the ego-driven misguidance of her preacher father, C.L. (Forest Whitaker), and her first husband, Ted (Marlon Wayans), and the well-intentioned efforts by Columbia Records’ John Hammond (Tate Donovan) to market her as a jazz singer—are a magical portrayal of artistic creation and collaboration. The performances, whether they’re in church or at Madison Square Garden, are bliss. But the movie’s still a mess.<br />The rap on old Hollywood biographies was that the films disregarded fact for crowd-pleasing fiction. Cole Porter was not Cary Grant (per “Night and Day”); the portrayal of Billie Holiday’s life in “Lady Sings the Blues” was a “fraud,” as one critic put it, despite the performance by Diana Ross. But the intent was always to make an entertaining movie, realities be damned. The impulse behind “Respect” is to create something epic, a memorial to its subject, and the upshot is a movie not only rigid with cliché but bloated beyond reason. Ms. Hudson doesn’t sing the title song (recorded by Franklin in 1967) until about an hour and a half into the 145-minute film, which ends in 1972. And yet “Respect” still massages the facts, or simply leaves its audience bewildered about them.<br />If the producers wanted a definitive “Respect” they might have looked elsewhere than Liesl Tommy, a stage and TV director (“The Walking Dead”) making her big-screen debut, or screenwriter Tracey Scott Wilson (who collaborated on the “story” with Callie Khouri of “Thelma & Louise”). Together, they shoehorn the Franklin bio into a number of standard-issue formats—the coming of age of a great artist; her rise and fall and rise; her self-affirmation and liberation. It’s like a sports movie with soul music. Also, children are popping up everywhere with no explanation and time is beyond elastic. (Franklin had her first child at  age 12, something that is addressed obliquely, albeit uncomfortably.) Concision and compression are to be expected. Confusion is not.</td>

      <td>A documentary all about bubbly features interviews with experts and spokespeople from major Champagne houses, with an emphasis on winemaking minutiae.</td>
      <td><br />Peter the Great took four bottles to bed with him each night. Alexander II was so paranoid that the company Roederer had to create its transparent bottle, so the czar could check for impurities (or poison). It was the Widow Clicquot (of Veuve Clicquot) who discovered how to get sediment out of the wine. And while the Benedictine monk Dom Pérignon has always been credited with creating the first batch, it was sturdy English bottling that made the whole enterprise possible.<br />Such are some of the tales told in “Sparkling: The Story of Champagne,” and you wish there were a good deal more of them—about Napoleon, for instance: He was such a fan that his army was followed by another—an army of wine merchants, who wound up introducing the drink to Russia. Waterloo might have been bad for Napoleon, we are advised, “but it was very good for Champagne.”<br />Directed by first-timer Frank Mannion and featuring heirs, vintners and spokespeople for all the major Champagne houses, “Sparkling” will likely be an oenophile’s delight—it’s a bacchanalian romp through winemaking minutiae that are beyond the grasp or attention span of the everyday drinker or, certainly, the casual movie viewer. It’s quite upfront about the marketing of individual brands, though, and some of that is fascinatingly frank: how celebrities become identified with different labels (Marilyn Monroe is still associated with Piper-Heidsieck); how Bollinger has been featured in 15 James Bond movies; and how Taittinger sponsors the BAFTA awards. Winston Churchill was a Pol Roger man. Jay-Z presumably drinks Armand de Brignac (because he owns half the company). Champagne’s movie debut, according to "Sparkling,” was in “Sons of the Desert” with Laurel & Hardy trying to open a bottle of Piper-Heidsieck.<br />Too many of the interviews, however, feel like there’s a publicist hovering just outside the frame, and some of the interviewees are publicists. Everyone wants to promote his or her label over the others. At a certain point, the movie becomes about promoting one country over another: With the French climate growing too warm for proper grape production, the south of England is attracting more and more winemakers to its chalky soil, and the debate rages in “Sparkling” about the quality of English champagne—which can’t rightfully be called Champagne because it’s not from the Champagne region—and how it compares to its French antecedent. The French winemakers sniff. The English cheer. The film eventually falls off the track, perhaps a bit tipsy.</td>

      <td>The Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival bids farewell to its current campus with a superb production of the play thought to be one of Shakespeare’s last.</td>
      <td>Garrison, N.Y.<br />None of Shakespeare’s plays is better suited to outdoor staging than “The Tempest,” whose setting is an enchanted island, and it is hard to imagine a better place to see it than under the tent of the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival, pitched on a wooded bluff overlooking the Hudson River. There being few finer summer theater companies in America, I expected much of Ryan Quinn’s new production, and I got all I hoped for: This was a “Tempest” that gave pleasure of every conceivable kind, one in which Shakespeare’s tale of forgiveness and redemption is retold in such a way as to give like delight to those who know the play well and those who are seeing it for the first time.<br />It’s widely thought by contemporary scholars that “The Tempest” was one of Shakespeare’s last plays. If so, it is fitting that he should have used the occasion to tell the story of Prospero (Howard W. Overshown), an Italian duke whose throne was stolen from him by his faithless brother and who was set adrift with Miranda (Kayla Coleman), his young daughter, finding his way to a deserted island where he occupied himself by learning the occult arts of sorcery and scheming for his ultimate revenge—a longing that he sets aside at evening’s end when his now-aged soul is redeemed by love.<br />Mr. Quinn’s “Tempest” is characteristic of the HVSF’s now-familiar “house style.” Utterly straightforward, with no obscuring high directorial concept superimposed on Shakespeare’s text, it is played out on a plain dirt stage floor devoid of sets and, for the most part, props, with pop-style dancing (skillfully choreographed by Susannah Millonzi) used to set the scene. The magical powers of the furious Prospero are brilliantly suggested by the sound design of Charles Coes and Nathan Roberts and the lighting of Lucrecia Briceno. All else is left to the actors, the text, and the viewer’s imagination.<br />No less typical of Hudson Valley is an emphasis on comedy, one that is populist in the best sense of the word, with Ralph Adriel Johnson making an uproarious impression as Trinculo, the hard-drinking jester who introduces Caliban (Jason O’Connell), Prospero’s servant-slave, to the risky joys of liquor. Mr. O’Connell, a stand-up comedian who got his start playing Shakespearean clowns at Hudson Valley and has since matured into a classical actor of high distinction, puts a subtle spin on the part: His Caliban is a tragic monster, one whose plight is neither horrifying nor ludicrous but heartbreaking. As Miranda and Ariel, Prospero’s spirit-servant, Ms. Coleman and Britney Simpson are fresh and charming.</td>

      <td><br />There’s some question as to whether Covid-19 will always be with us. There’s no question about Adolf Hitler. Turn on your TV and “you have a 95% chance of getting a Hitler documentary,” according to Enno Lenze, who runs the Berlin Story Bunker (located exactly where you think it is). “There’s ’Hitler’s Friends,’ ‘Hitler in Private,’ ‘Hitler’s Household,’ ‘The 10 Things You Didn’t Know About Hitler’—which are always the 10 things you already knew about Hitler.” Mr. Lenze lives in Germany, but it’s not much different elsewhere in the world.<br />So how does a film titled “The Meaning of Hitler” address being yet another documentary about a subject who “resists understanding”? This one, by the husband-wife team of Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein (“Gunner Palace,” “Karl Marx City”), asks serious questions—about itself. “Is it possible to make a film like this without contributing to the expanse of the Hitler Cinematic Universe?” asks narrator Matilda Tucker (daughter of the directors). And the answer is no. But this ambitious and mutedly angry film also assumes an ironic tone in examining the Hitler phenomenon from angles political, sociological, psychological and, very intriguingly, cinematic. Using Sebastian Haffner’s 1978 eponymous book as a launch point, the couple intends its “Meaning of Hitler” to be part biography, part media study, part analysis of authoritarian regimes world-wide, and a debunking of pop-psychological explanations of why Hitler became Hitler. “Good luck,” says the historian, memoirist and Holocaust survivor Saul Friedländer, who’s been down the Tucker-Epperlein road before.<br />But so have most people who are interested in the phenomenon of Nazism and of otherwise “normal” people falling in line behind a dictator. As one interviewee observes, every psychiatric diagnosis has been assigned to Hitler, along with every means of either excusing his behavior or excusing him from the ranks of humanity. What gives “The Meaning of Hitler” urgency right now is the rise of white nationalism, anti-Semitism and the politicization of fact. Donald Trump comes up in the conversation. “You might as well get on to their similarities,” the novelist Martin Amis says during an interview, with something close to resignation. “Fanatical cleanliness is one trait. And of course lying is another.” Mr. Amis seems to be acknowledging that comparisons to Nazis have become ubiquitous, and reflexive, and that they diminish the reality of Hitler’s crimes. Besides, the borrowing from Mr. Haffner’s book is really about the “controlled chaos” that any would-be despot like Hitler imposes on “an intact state organism,” something common to coups everywhere.<br />“The problem that we have is not that the Nazis were inhuman,” says Holocaust scholar Yehuda Bauer, “but that they were human.” This sentiment—that the followers of Hitler were not extraordinary in any way—is part of much Holocaust study. It runs through a documentary that features a legion of academics, authors, doctors, Nazi hunters (Beate and Serge Klarsfeld)—and even Holocaust denier David Irving, who is seen leading tour groups through former Polish death camps and explaining that Jews died because they couldn’t survive manual labor. One of Mr. Irving’s leading antagonists, Deborah Lipstadt—their libel case was the basis of the 2016 drama feature “Denial”—makes one of the more memorable observations in a movie with no shortage of them, specifically about anti-Semitism: “When you try to give a rational explanation for an irrational sentiment, you’re lost.” (Ms. Lipstadt was nominated last month by President Biden to be the U.S. special envoy for monitoring and combating anti-Semitism.) The directors heed her advice.</td>

And 76,000 parents and children crossed the border together as families, the second-highest total ever and a significant jump from June.<br />The CBP data only includes the number of arrests and doesn’t account for people who made it across the border without being apprehended—typically single adults in search of work who don’t intend to ask for asylum.<br />The past six months mark the longest period in recent history that monthly crossings have remained near or above 100,000, an unrelenting pace that has placed a heavy strain on the immigration system and posed one of the largest political challenges for the Biden administration so far.</td>

The stock rose steadily from its early pandemic low as Disney+ added subscribers, including when the total hit 100 million after just 16 months.

      <td>Gen X and older millennial women are increasingly splurging on multiple earlobe and cartilage piercings. Some are awakening long-dormant wild streaks. Others are reasserting their identities.</td>
      <td>IT’S 11 A.M. on a Tuesday when the needle slides cleanly through my flesh. I am in the back room of Ink Side Out tattoo parlor in Norwalk, Conn., with a new friend by my side. In lieu of Pilates or lattes, we—two mothers of a combined seven children—are getting third and fourth holes in our earlobes shortly after camp drop-off. It feels, to this 39-year-old writer, like dancing on the edge.<br />“There is a thrill to that moment when the piercing happens,” said Aya Kanai, head of content and creator partnerships at  Pinterest ,  which reported 140 times more searches for “cool ear piercings” year over year. “Up until I was 40, I had the same single hole in each ear,” said Ms. Kanai, 43. “Now I can’t stop.” She currently has eight, and is plotting a tiny sword through her cartilage. Pain is not an issue: “I did IVF three times,” Ms. Kanai quipped. “I could put a needle in my eyeball if you told me I had to.”<br />Multiple ear piercings are resurging among Gen X and elder millennial women who first sprung for second holes at the mall in fits of 18-year-old rebellion. Some are awakening long-dormant wild streaks. Others are cathartically puncturing their pandemic-induced weariness.<br />Since December, Gillian Rice Maupin, an attorney and mother of two in Alexandria, Va., has added one new hole in her left ear and two more in her right at local parlor Craig Pokes U. At home, she reopened the cartilage piercing of her youth. “You’re locked in your house with your kids and all of a sudden that aspect of your identity is 95% of your life,” said Ms. Maupin, 37. She said her piercings send a message: “Wait, I’m not just a mom. I’m still young and I’m still cool.”<br />Influencer zero Gwyneth Paltrow, 48, has earfuls of dainty gold hoops. Instagram is alight with “ear parties”: ears bedecked with curated amalgamations of huggies, evil-eyes and mismatching sun-and-moon studs. Brands like Mejuri and Catbird indulge the trend by selling single hearts and bars. “I like it to feel like a charm bracelet, but for your ear,” said Ms. Kanai, a former fashion editor who sports a lightning bolt, a New York logo and a dangling version of her name by designer Alison Lou. Star piercer J. Colby Smith, who has studios in Brooklyn and Los Angeles, suggests wearing heavier earrings in lower holes and decreasing the size as you move up, tapering to the shape of your ear. Piercings have gone from punk to pretty, he said, “but they’re still a little punk.”</td>

      <td>The stablecoin has secured itself a critical place in the crypto ecosystem, but its holdings fall short compared with those of prime money-market funds</td>
      <td>One of the things most cryptocurrency enthusiasts really don’t want is more exposure to the U.S. government. It turns out—via the biggest so-called stablecoin, tether—that is exactly what they got. Holdings of Treasury bills backing tether surged, according to the first accountant-verified breakdown of its issuer’s $63 billion of assets.<br />Tether is designed to trade one-for-one with the dollar and has become immensely popular as a way for traders quickly to shift money between crypto exchanges or park cash without going through the hassle of transferring it to a bank account.<br />But its peg to the dollar is dependent on the value and availability of its investments, and here the new disclosure brings both good and bad news. The good news is that with more detailed disclosure and the stamp of approval from an accountant, it is less likely that Tether, the company that issues the coin, and linked crypto brokerage Bitfinex are repeating the illegal practices that led to an $18.5 million settlement with the New York Attorney General earlier this year.<br />The bad news is that the disclosure is still far less than is provided by regulated money-market funds. The accountant’s assurance is limited to one day, and it is based in the Cayman Islands—albeit part of Moore Global, a second-tier international firm. And the portfolio still includes plenty of assets that would be hard to sell to support the value of the coin in an emergency.<br />Tether has secured itself a critical place in the crypto ecosystem, with three times as much trading between bitcoin and tether as between bitcoin and dollars. Tether is bigger than the next two largest stablecoins put together. Yet doubt has swirled around its legitimacy after revelations of banking troubles and misuse of its assets, culminating in the New York legal action which led to it being banned from operating in the state and agreeing to publish information about its holdings.</td>

      <td>The classic shirt dress works equally well on vacation in late summer and in the boardroom come autumn</td>
      <td>SARAH RUSTON is busy packing to move from Los Angeles to London, and the only clothing not boxed are eight shirt dresses she plans to wear until her flight in early September. The style is a standby for the fashion insider. “I probably have 25 of them in my wardrobe,” she said. “When I spot a good one, I don’t think twice about buying it.” When I called her, she was wearing a 20-year-old Chanel version in blue with white pinstripes, belted with the sleeves rolled up. The dress is an urbane workhorse: That day alone she wore it to the eye doctor, to pick up dry cleaning and to afternoon tea at a swanky hotel.<br />Ms. Rutson is a fashion consultant who spent decades leading buying teams at Lane Crawford in Hong Kong and Net-a-porter in London. She considers the shirt dress the hardest working item in a woman’s wardrobe, especially in these confusing where-am-I-working times. The frock is casual enough for a beach picnic yet just formal enough for a meeting. “It fends off the perpetual fashion fear of: ‘Will I be overdressed?’” she explained. “It’s perfect for re-entry.”<br />Holly Wright, designer of London brand Tove Studio, also endorses the style’s dress-up-or-dress-down quality. The brand’s Ceres shirtdress (pictured), first released in the summer of 2020, has sold over 4,000 units, a staggering number for an emerging brand. When designing this dress, Ms. Wright imagines it worn in multiple situations during multiple seasons. “We wanted it to be something you could really lean on,” she said, noting that she and her business partner, Camille Perry, prize functionality in their designs.<br />The sweet spot for a shirt-dress hemline, according to both Ms. Wright and Ms. Rutson, is a mid-calf length. “It’s going to flatter everyone, whether you have great legs or not,” Ms. Wright said. “Plus, the length allows it to be more formal when needed.” As Ms. Rutson pointed out, some of us will still favor outdoor appointments come fall. “If I’m meeting someone for lunch in the park and sitting in the grass or sitting high on a barstool, it allows me to be ready for anything.”<br />Ms. Rutson is currently dressing her shirt dresses down with super-casual Birkenstocks. But she said she will dress the style up with heels...“if we ever wear heels again.”</td>

My sister and I were fortunate to obtain four-year degrees and graduate without student-loan debt. We could do so because it was our father’s goal to fund our educations.<br />My dad was a steelworker. He worked hard to achieve his goal, and sacrificed along the way. He raised his hand to work overtime every chance he got. He purchased run-down homes, repaired them himself and rented to those in need. We did not live in a fancy home, nor did he wear nice clothes. We were one of the last families I knew to get a VCR. One of my fondest childhood memories is attending the local auto auction where my dad bought cars.<br />It’s unfortunate that politicians today fail to promote the stories of people like my dad—stories of goals, sacrifice and achievement. Instead, they promote poor decision-making and offer handouts as remedies. When I am called “privileged” today, I nod and agree.

South of Herat, the insurgents overran the Shindand air base, one of the biggest in the country, according to officials and videos on social media.<br />“Unfortunately, the Taliban managed to get into [Herat] city with the help of their infiltrators,” said Abdul Razaq Ahmadi, an aide to Ismail Khan, a warlord who tried to organize a defense of Herat. “The police headquarters has been captured by the Taliban as all police forces left it before the arrival of the Taliban militants.”<br />By nightfall, other residents said, the insurgents took control of the rest of the city.</td>

      <td>The company will set up a prevention committee with five female executives after an employee accused her supervisor of assaulting her</td>
      <td>TAIPEI— Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  has announced new policies to combat sexual harassment, a response to sexual-assault allegations by a female employee that rocked the company and caused widespread public backlash in the past few days.<br />The steps released by China’s biggest e-commerce company Thursday include establishing a dedicated committee for sexual-harassment prevention, comprising five female senior executives, setting up another team responsible for investigating complaints, and improving its policies on dealing with sexual harassment and inappropriate workplace behavior. They were the result of internal review, discussions and employee feedback, the company said in a memo to employees, which it later released to the public.<br />The measures come after the woman’s accusations that her supervisor forced her to drink alcohol and sexually assaulted her, as well as her claims that other managers at the company mishandled her complaints.<br />On Saturday, an Alibaba employee who didn’t disclose her name shared an 11-page account on the company’s internal discussion board accusing her supervisor of sexual assault. In her recounting, which later went viral on Chinese social media, she said the manager, Wang Chengwen, brought her to a client dinner and forced her to drink heavily. She said she was then kissed and groped against her will by both a male client and Mr. Wang.<br />Mr. Wang couldn’t be reached for comment. The client couldn’t be reached for comment, though to local media he denied sexually harassing the woman at Alibaba and said there was “normal drinking” so “of course there was hugging.” His employer said he had been fired. The victim couldn't be reached for comment. While she didn’t disclose her name in her allegations, Alibaba employees would be able to identify her through her original post.</td>

      <td>China may invade Taiwan within six years, admirals warn. Is the U.S. ready?</td>
      <td>The Chinese military will likely attack Taiwan within six years, Adm. Phil Davidson, commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, told Congress in March, just before retiring from the Navy. More generally, he said, Beijing’s long-term objective—supplanting the U.S. and remaking the global order to benefit the Chinese Communist Party—will feature confrontation.<br />Adm. Davidson’s assessment is the clearest articulation of contemporary strategic realities by a major government or military official in the past decade. China is showing its ambitions, increasing its assertiveness in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, and ratcheting up military pressure against Taiwan. The Chinese strategic tradition prizes both patience and decisive action when the balance of forces appears favorable.<br />The implication of Adm. Davidson’s assessment—and a similar one offered this spring by his successor, Adm. John Aquilino—is that any major reduction in U.S. combat strength, particularly naval power, will tempt the Chinese Communist Party to strike.<br />This assessment should inform the Navy’s recently announced “divest to invest” plan. The Navy will “divest” from older, larger platforms such as the Ticonderoga-class cruiser and reduce its large surface combatant force, including Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, by around one-third.<br />In turn, the Navy will “invest” in smaller, more numerous platforms, specifically a new Constellation-class frigate and a variety of unmanned surface combatants and undersea vehicles. The Navy will also speed up production of its Virginia-class submarines, the most modern in the fleet, and develop a yet-to-be-defined new submarine class. The Navy hopes “divest to invest” will make the fleet more distributed, more survivable and more lethal.</td>

      <td>Taxes haven’t gone up yet, but inflation and lost productivity amount to financial repression.</td>
      <td>It’s a $4.5 trillion week in Washington. Between the infrastructure and reconciliation bills in various stages of debate, it’s worth discussing in some depth how all this will be paid for. Government spending is conventionally understood as a matter of increased taxation and debt, a framing that has the virtue of being true. But that conversation is incomplete without also exploring the concept of financial repression—which ultimately underlies both the taxes and debt.<br />When the term was coined in the 1970s (by Stanford economists Ronald MacKinnon and Edward Shaw) it referred primarily to the dysfunctions of the banking systems in spendthrift developing countries. Governments would suppress interest rates on domestic savings to below the rate of inflation to reduce rates on lending. The point was to service government borrowing and subsidize credit to politically favored industries. In the process, they’d create a substantial wealth transfer from private creditors to debtors, leaving creditors with less purchasing power in the future while easing the real burden of debt repayment over time.<br />In emerging markets, this downward pressure on the interest rate paid on savings often still is accomplished via state ownership or effective public control of the banks. State domination of the financial system also facilitates the allocation of capital on the most favorable terms to politically connected borrowers. Developed economies have deployed this gimmick too. Regulation of the rates banks paid on savings was an important, and not the only, bit of financial repression perpetrated against Americans by the federal government in the lead-up to and aftermath of World War II.<br />That was a simpler era, and the understanding and practice of financial repression has grown more sophisticated alongside the evolution of the global economy and financial system. Banks in many countries remain important vectors for stealing from savers, but no longer are they the only accomplices (witting and willing or otherwise).<br />Financial repression nowadays consists of several overlapping phenomena beyond the classic suppression of bank interest rates. A nonexhaustive list: more-intrusive management of assets and credit allocation in the banking system via reserve requirements, capital regulations and the like; a blurring of the line between fiscal and monetary policy such that monetary authorities subsidize the fiscal authority’s borrowing while the fiscal authority creates new credit subsidies for other parties; and any press release from Sen. Elizabeth Warren demanding a new regulation on this sort of lending or that sort of borrowing.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—Sen. Rand Paul disclosed that his wife purchased stock in  Gilead Sciences Inc.  in late February 2020, the same day the company formally announced that it would start late-stage studies of its experimental treatment for Covid-19 in an acceleration of its push to evaluate the drug, remdesivir.<br />Mr. Paul (R., Ky.) disclosed on Wednesday the purchase by his wife, Kelley Paul, a year and a half after she bought between $1,000 and $15,000 of shares in the company. Her purchase came after the National Institutes of Health had already said that researchers at the University of Nebraska had started testing whether remdesivir was effective at treating Covid-19.<br />The stock traded between $70.72 and $75.47 on Feb. 26, the day of her purchase. Shares are currently trading below $70 a share. Under the Stock Act, lawmakers must disclose transactions within 45 days.<br />The Washington Post earlier reported the transaction and its delayed disclosure.<br />“Last year, Dr. Paul completed the reporting form for an investment made by his wife using her own earnings, an investment which she has lost money on,” his office said. “This was done in the appropriate time window. In the process of preparing to file his annual financial disclosure for last year, he learned that the form was not transmitted and promptly alerted the filing office and requested their guidance. In accordance with that guidance, he filed both reports today.”</td>

      <td>As we inch back to office life and renegotiate working remotely in the months to come, what will the midday meal look like? Tips on emerging trends, how to get the most out of the lunch hour and what we can expect to pay.</td>
      <td>ON HIS FIRST DAY back in his New York City office in July, Syed Ali found his biggest challenge, oddly, was lunch. After months of reheating leftovers to eat during Zoom calls, he was looking forward to a sit-down culinary adventure. Sadly, two of his go-to lunch spots had closed. The local outpost of salad chain Sweetgreen was still there but only allowed for online orders. In the end, Mr. Ali, an urban planner, spent most of his break wandering the still mostly empty streets near his Tribeca workplace before finally grabbing a sandwich to eat back at HQ.<br />First-world problem? Maybe. But uncertainty about who returns to the office, when and how frequently is making it tricky to predict what lunch will look like in a post-pandemic world. Restaurants, from fast food to fine dining, have invested millions in digital ordering, pickup and delivery to make lunch quick and frictionless, and are praying that after this last annus horribilis those investments prove sound. At the same time, office workers who were stuck at home for more than a year are yearning for human contact, which means lunches that are leisurely and social—or at least require them to leave their desks.<br />Heading into fall, restaurants and their customers face a swirl of questions and contradictory trends. One thing is clear: Lunch, like nearly everything else in our lives, is changing. Here, a preview.<br />Like many office workers before the pandemic, Philadelphia psychologist Erin Hadley prioritized a fast lunch. The shorter her lunch break, the sooner she could return to her patients and get home to her young son. But starting in September, she hopes to be in the office at most two days a week, so a leisurely sit-down lunch—she dreams of the seafood tower at the Oyster House in Center City—seems both reasonable and a key opportunity to catch up with friends. “I want to be more mindful of the time I can spend with people,” she said.<br />In other words, a day at the office suddenly feels less like drudgery and more like a day out. Mr. Ali, the urban planner, said that before the pandemic he often brought lunch to work. But like many professionals, he managed to save more money than usual last year—in part by not going out to lunch. Now he is happy to splurge on the days he actually goes to work.</td>

The company said it plans to share much of the cash proceeds with shareholders after the deal is expected to close in next year’s first quarter.</td>

That approach has been credited for keeping its Covid-19 infection rate among the lowest in the world, with 26 reported deaths since the pandemic began.<br />Laying out the reopening strategy, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern warned that New Zealand might always need some protection at its borders, comparing the pandemic to the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the U.S.<br />“Just like after 9/11, the border will never be the same after Covid,” Ms. Ardern said. “Things can change, but that doesn’t mean we can’t adapt to them in a way that eventually feels normal again.”<br />New Zealand’s policy of eliminating rather than slowing the spread of the virus has included lockdowns and rapid contact-tracing in addition to strict border-control measures. Officials haven’t recorded any Covid-19 cases passed on in the community for 165 days.</td>

      <td>Social-media company says it expects to secure additional financial commitments from new and existing investors</td>
      <td>Six months after closing a funding round that doubled its valuation, Reddit Inc. is locking in a roughly 50% increase, driven by money managers hunting for investments and its role in the Wall Street trading frenzy.<br />Reddit on Thursday said it has raised $410 million from Fidelity Investments Inc. at a valuation of about $10 billion. The company said it expects to secure additional financial commitments from new and existing investors to bring the total raised to as much as $700 million. In February, the company said it had raised about $500 million in late-stage funding at a $6.5 billion valuation.<br />Bumper financing rounds with big leaps in valuation are becoming almost routine for many startups as big money-management firms and others are pouring massive amounts of funding into Silicon Valley, hunting for healthy returns at a time of low interest rates. Fanatics Inc., the sports retailer, recently announced it had tripled its valuation in a year to $18 billion. Clubhouse, the startup audio-chat social network, secured a $1 billion valuation earlier this year. It quadrupled that figure within about three months, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Reddit Chief Executive Steve Huffman said the company opted to raise additional money prompted by Fidelity, a longtime investor in the social-media site that is leading the latest funding round. Reddit, he said, also is looking to further capitalize on the popularity it gained when the WallStreetBets forum put the company in the spotlight as individual investors rallied around buying certain stocks such as  GameStop Corp.  The episode brought in millions of new users, Mr. Huffman said, as well as new advertisers, the source of the bulk of the company’s revenue.<br />Reddit, in the most recent quarter, had $100 million in advertising revenue for the first time, almost triple the prior-year figure, though it remains unprofitable. And the ad sales figure still means it is a relatively minor player in a business of giants.  Facebook Inc.  generated $28.6 billion in ad sales in the most recent quarter, and Google’s parent company,  Alphabet Inc.,  made more than $50 billion from ads in the same period.</td>

In addition, they say, Taliban commanders have demanded that communities turn over unmarried women to become “wives” for their fighters—a form of sexual violence, human-rights groups say.<br />The U.S. Embassy in Kabul said Thursday that it had received reports of the Taliban executing members of the Afghan military who had surrendered. “Deeply disturbing & could constitute war crimes,” the embassy said on Twitter.<br />A Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, denied the group had killed any prisoners, saying that would violate its principles. He also said allegations that the Taliban was forcing women into marriage were false, and that such actions would be contrary to the rules of Islam and violate cultural tradition.<br />On Wednesday, Mawlawi Abdul Qadir, a senior Taliban religious official, said in a speech in the newly captured capital of Badakhshan province that government soldiers who surrender and “confess their crimes” would be able “to live like a Muslim under the flag of the Islamic Emirate.”</td>

      <td>Many oenophiles take particular pleasure in teasing out the nuances of terroir, the specific combination of soil, topography and climate that makes a wine unique. But what happens when extreme weather events and rising temperatures hit a wine region?</td>
      <td>THE FRENCH TERM terroir has been defined in various ways—and called undefinable, too—but it’s generally understood to denote a combination of soil, topography and climate that gives a wine its particular character. With so many wine regions flooded or on fire in recent months and years, I’ve wondered: Does this change their terroir?<br />Terroir and climate have both been topics of fierce debate. Just as some people don’t believe climate change is real, some oenophiles think terroir is a ruse, a mere marketing tool. Recent extreme weather events are certainly real: In this grape-growing season we have seen massive floods wash out vineyards in western Germany and severe drought affect California’s wine regions. Is it possible that certain places may no longer be viable for the grapes traditionally grown there? And how might wine regions and the characteristics that define their wines shift as a result? When I put these questions to wine professionals, climate scientists and a terroir consultant, I heard conflicting answers as well as a few reasons to hope amid much despair.<br />Today, winemakers, marketers and writers alike tend to invoke “terroir” with reverence, to describe a distinctive wine of a notable place, but it wasn’t always so. In his book “Terroir and Other Myths of Winegrowing,” Mark A. Matthews notes, “[F]rom our earliest records, terroir is employed as a pejorative when describing wine flavor, and that undesirable flavor is described as the soil.” Not until the French instituted the modern appellation d’origine contrôlée system for wines in the early 20th century, establishing the importance of a specific place and the unique conditions there to grape growing and winemaking, did the word acquire its current cachet.<br />When I talked to Chile-based terroir consultant Pedro Parra, who holds a Ph.D. in terroir, he defined terroir as a combination of nature and human intervention. Mr. Parra’s book “Terroir Footprints” describes his work with viticulturists and winemakers all over the world and his passion for soil (and especially rocks). He believes climate change can alter a wine region’s terroir.<br />Burgundy vigneron Véronique Boss-Drouhin, who oversees winemaking at her family’s Beaune-based domaine, does not believe climate extremes have affected Burgundy’s winemaking negatively. In an email she wrote, “Global warming has been a good thing for the quality of the wines.” She cited increased temperatures as beneficial for a region where the weather in the 1970s and 1980s was often too cool or too rainy for grapes to ripen properly.</td>

The House hasn’t yet approved the legislation.<br />Mr. Gates, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, said a fund run by his Breakthrough Energy could spend the money over three years on projects aimed at slowing the greenhouse-gas emissions that cause climate change. The Breakthrough projects, which would have to compete with other applicants for the funds, could include emissions-free fuel for planes and technology to suck carbon-dioxide out of the air.<br />“Critical for all these climate technologies is to get the costs down and to be able to scale them up to a pretty gigantic level,” Mr. Gates said. “You’ll never get that scale up unless the government’s coming in with the right policies, and the right policy is exactly what’s in that infrastructure bill.”<br />Breakthrough will likely shift funding for the biggest projects to Europe and Asia instead if the package doesn’t become law, he added.</td>

As director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Walensky said she has learned the same isn’t always true of many people in the U.S.<br />“My job is to put my head down, ignore the criticism and do the right thing for the public and to do the right thing for health,” Dr. Walensky said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. “And so that’s what I did.”<br />When Dr. Walensky assumed her post in January, she vowed to restore trust in an agency where some officials said they felt undermined and sidelined by the Trump administration during the first year of the pandemic. She has become a fixture at White House briefings on Covid-19, and President Biden has said her agency is in charge of key public-health recommendations.<br />Dr. Walensky, in her first government post, has repeatedly been the target of public criticism as her agency has taken a central role in the federal response to the pandemic. The CDC’s shifting guidance on masks and schools has confused some public officials, and many Americans, and often put Dr. Walensky on the defensive. At times, some public-health experts say, she hasn’t sufficiently accounted for the way people think and behave. Some of the experts say she has failed to draw a clear connection for the public between policy and the data guiding the CDC’s decisions.<br />“Their communication has to be much better,” said Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine at the Scripps Research Institute. “Just tell it like it is. They haven’t done that.”</td>

      <td>TEL AVIV—After becoming one of the first countries to open up thanks to a widespread Covid-19 vaccination campaign, Israel is again on guard, this time against the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus.<br />Mask mandates are back, including requirements to mask up for large outdoor gatherings. Many venues require people to show proof of vaccination, a negative Covid-19 test or proof of recovery from the virus. People returning from most countries have to quarantine for at least a week, even if they are fully vaccinated. Over-60s are being offered a third, booster shot of  Pfizer Inc.’s  vaccine, with the hopes it can suppress the rise of cases of severe illness.<br />Health officials are warning that Israel could face a fourth lockdown during the Jewish holiday season in September if the country doesn’t improve on its 80% adult vaccination rate and deliver more booster shots.<br />A little over a month ago, day-to-day life in Israel was quickly getting back to normal. People were dining indoors or attending concerts without needing the so-called green pass, a digital certificate stored on phones to show the holder is fully vaccinated. But the more contagious Delta variant is forcing a change in tack, in a test case for what could happen elsewhere, including countries with high vaccination rates.<br />“That window when we weren’t concerned about things was so brief,” said Rena Magun, 61 years old, who co-runs a tourism and Jewish events-planning business with her husband in Jerusalem.</td>

Most of the cash has gone into cheap, index-tracking funds, with large-cap and short-term bond ETFs, as well as products offering inflation protection, attracting significant investor interest, according to the data.<br />U.S. ETFs accounted for a record $519 billion of the total, sending assets in U.S. funds to about $6.6 trillion. ETFs now hold more money than index-tracking mutual funds, which had about $8.8 trillion in assets as of June, though mutual funds overall still command more money, with about $40.7 trillion in assets.<br />ETFs are baskets of securities that are as easy to trade as a stock. They lack the investment minimums found in many mutual funds, are generally more tax efficient and carry lower fees. The success of ETFs was far from guaranteed after the first one launched in 1993. But enthusiasm for low-cost investments has led to an explosion in ETF assets over the last 10 years.<br />“ETFs are probably the greatest success story in financial services over the last two decades,” said Anaelle Ubaldino, head of ETF research and investment advisory at data firm TrackInsight, which also tracked ETFs crossing the $9 trillion mark last month.</td>

Giphy allows users to search for, create and share animated images known as GIFs, which stands for graphics interchange format.<br />The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority began probing the deal in June 2020 and launched an initial investigation in January. On Thursday it said it would now seek responses from interested parties to its provisional findings and issue a final report on Oct. 6. The CMA added that if its competition concerns are ultimately confirmed, it could require Facebook to sell off Giphy in its entirety.<br />Facebook said it disagreed with the CMA’s preliminary findings and that it would work with the regulator to “address the misconception that the deal harms competition.”<br />The CMA said that millions of daily posts on social media include GIFs and that any reduction in choice or quality of images could affect how people use the sites, and whether they might switch to another platform.</td>

      <td>Investors who have cooled on online-dating stocks like Match and Bumble will be lured back soon enough</td>
      <td>Online-dating companies might look like scorned lovers in the stock market these days, but that doesn’t mean they won’t find their happily ever after.<br />After a solid first quarter,  Match Group  and  Bumble  reported second-quarter earnings over the past two weeks that topped Wall Street’s expectations. But after significant gains earlier this year for both stocks, even big numbers have done little to keep the fire alive. As of Wednesday’s close, Match’s shares were down 7% this year, including a 12% selloff this month. And while Bumble’s shares soared on their first day of trading in February, closing 63% above their offering price, they have lost 32% of their value since.<br />Chances are, some of those losses will linger. In part because of Covid-19’s impact, Match’s third-quarter revenue guidance last week came in slightly below analysts’ forecast, excluding Hyperconnect, the Korean social-discovery app Match bought this year. Bumble’s guidance looked solid for the third quarter; but the company also said many users of its other app, Badoo, reside in some of the areas hardest hit by the latest Covid-19 wave, which could weigh on its growth until conditions improve. Match’s shares are down more than 6% since its report last week, while shares of Bumble traded up less than 1% after hours Wednesday following its earnings call.<br />The good news is that full-year guidance shows both companies expect the period to end on a high note. In that case, investors may get another shot at love—perhaps for an even more reasonable price. Both Match and Bumble now fetch around 11 times forward sales, not cheap but a discount from their respective highs this year.<br />Weighing the growth profiles of these two companies isn’t easy. Match’s revenue grew 27% year on year in the second quarter, below the 38% growth in total revenue Bumble reported, and well below the 55% growth seen by Bumble’s namesake app for the period. But Match’s larger portfolio of apps, of varying age and size, makes apples-to-apples comparisons difficult. Match’s new reporting metrics show it has more than five times the number of paying users, or payers, that Bumble does.</td>

      <td>Purdue Pharma will seek approval of a settlement with its Sackler family owners with support from most states and opposition from a few</td>
      <td>The company most often blamed for the opioid epidemic, OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP, sought refuge in bankruptcy from an onslaught of lawsuits that threatened to put the drugmaker out of business.<br />Now, after nearly two years in chapter 11, Purdue heads to trial in a New York bankruptcy court to seek approval of a multibillion-dollar proposal to settle the nationwide litigation that hinges on a  roughly $4.5 billion contribution from the company’s Sackler family owners. If successful, the bankruptcy plan will transform the drugmaker into a public benefit company dedicated to providing opioid addiction medicine and overdose treatments—with no involvement from the founding family.<br />Standing in Purdue’s way are a handful of state and federal authorities that oppose the Sackler deal and argue they can’t be forced into its terms. The Sacklers have been named as defendants in litigation alleging they share liability for fueling opioid addiction, which they deny. Purdue is among the drug manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies facing litigation over opioids, some of which separately agreed last month to a historic $26 billion settlement to address the epidemic.<br />The bankruptcy trial, scheduled to begin Thursday, won’t weigh Purdue’s or the Sacklers’ potential culpability in the opioid crisis. Instead, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain is expected to consider the settlement’s value and whether its economics offer a fair resolution to the chapter 11 case.<br />The bankruptcy court will consider the application of a legal tool known as a nonconsensual third-party release, which would extinguish claims against the Sacklers even by creditors that object. If approved, the settlement would begin funding abatement programs later this year, court papers show.</td>

But they were historic, too, because many of the protesters were Black Cubans, a group that is increasingly breaking with the country’s Communist government.<br />The protests, which were repressed by police and organized government supporters, included Cubans of all ages, races and classes. But Afro-Cubans were at the forefront of many of the nationwide demonstrations, according to protesters and Cuba experts. The most intense protests and violence, including the lone death acknowledged by the government, happened in impoverished and largely Black neighborhoods, Cuba’s government and dissidents say. And many, if not a majority, of those arrested in a subsequent crackdown are Black, their relatives and activists say.<br />“This is a fundamental break between Afro descendants and the government,” says Manuel Cuesta Morúa, a Black Cuban civil-rights activist. “The government saw delinquents where there are only angry people fed up with the lack of social mobility, lack of freedom and structural racism.”<br />The growing defiance of Afro-Cubans, who make up more than a third of the island’s 11 million people, is a turnaround for a group often seen as natural allies of a government that 62 years ago overthrew a dictatorship and prohibited racial discrimination. But in the past three decades, many Black Cubans, like many other Cubans, have become disillusioned with government policies that have widened racial and income disparities. The pandemic and a steep economic contraction have added to the pain.<br />While the government has long painted a picture of racial equality in Cuba, experts say Blacks in Cuba still have a harder time getting ahead than whites. Blacks are the poorest Cubans, have fewer people sending them dollar remittances from abroad and struggle to get jobs in either top government posts or the key tourism industry, according to surveys, Cuba analysts and interviews with Cuban Black activists.</td>

That, and other measures aimed at slowing the spread of the Delta variant, has in recent days spooked traders who were already worried about the fragile nature of China’s economic recovery.<br />The IEA cut its 2021 global oil demand growth forecast by 100,000 barrels a day, while upgrading its 2022 forecast by 200,000 barrels a day. Both the IEA and OPEC expect the world’s thirst for oil to return to pre-pandemic highs in the second half of next year.<br />The Paris-based IEA said the timing of the variant’s spread has coincided with planned supply increases from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies “stamping out lingering suggestions of a near-term supply crunch or supercycle.”</td>

      <td>This column is part of the Heard on the Street Stock Picking Contest. You’re invited to play along with us here.<br />Even the most cursory reader of news has seen the headlines by now: Used cars are expensive, and weather across the U.S. has been extreme. While that sounds like trouble to most people, it is music to the ears of car-parts retailer  Advance Auto Parts .<br />Investors have been slower to take notice, though. Advance Auto Parts shares are up 32% since the beginning of 2020 but have lagged behind a basket of retailers by 30 percentage points. Meanwhile, a basket of used- and new-car sellers’ stocks has done far better over the same period, even after excluding high-growth e-commerce names such as Carvana.<br />The blockbuster profits seen in the used-car selling business will wind down when the chip shortage eases. The effects on the car parts and repairs business, however, could prove lasting. The average age of cars and light trucks on U.S. roads is a record 12.1 years according to IHS Markit. In particular, there has been healthy growth in cars aged 4-to-11 years, which is deemed a sweet spot as they are often past their warranty and can be serviced by independent garages—an important customer cohort for Advance Auto Parts.<br />The scarcity of new vehicles and higher used-car prices should prompt more car owners to continue repairing their existing vehicles for some time, especially with the absence of another round of stimulus checks. Sure, those prices may be coming off their highs—Manheim data shows wholesale used-vehicle prices declined slightly in July compared with June. But they remain 24% more expensive than a year earlier so a return to normal pricing could take time. Auto makers have said the chip shortage could weigh on production well into the second half of this year.</td>

      <td>China’s most indebted property company is selling off strategic assets, but that probably isn’t enough to save it</td>
      <td>The troubles of China’s most indebted property developer are still far from over.<br />Shares of China Evergrande rose 11% this week due to a company announcement that it is in talks to sell part of its stake in listed subsidiaries including its electric-vehicle unit and its property-management arm. But the company’s financial situation remains dire. Evergrande’s stock has lost almost 80% since July last year. Its bonds are trading at distressed levels: Some of them are worth less than half of their par values.<br />Evergrande’s stakes in the two listed companies are valued around $16 billion, which could help relieve some immediate liquidity pressure. In particular, the property-management company, which is profitable with a stable business, could be appealing to other developers. Its unprofitable EV unit, which is carrying heavy debt and has yet to sell a single car, could be harder to unload. The value of Evergrande’s 65% stake in its EV unit is around $10 billion, a drop of more than 80% since February. Evergrande has already raised around $400 million this month by selling a 7% stake in its internet unit to investors including Tencent.<br />Still, the company needs to sell even more assets to plug its financial hole. Evergrande had around $104 billion of interest-bearing debt as of March, but that isn’t even the most urgent problem. It doesn’t have any bonds due until March next year. The bigger worry comes from its unpaid suppliers and contractors—many have sued to get their money back and some have managed to get some of Evergrande’s assets frozen.<br />For example, Shenzhen-listed Leo Group said last week that it is suing Evergrande for $55 million including unpaid advertising fees and commercial acceptance bills that are overdue or nearly due. Construction-material company Lets Holdings said it would stop accepting commercial acceptance bills from Evergrande. The company already owns around $5 million of such bills.</td>

      <td>The companies that built last century’s power grid are preparing for a more high-tech build out in the next wave</td>
      <td>Siemens ,   ABB  and  Schneider Electric  were at the heart of electrifying society last century. In the new age of electrification, they have a different focus: digital technology.<br />With roots stretching back to the 19th century, the trio helped build Europe’s electricity infrastructure, from power plants through to plug sockets. Like  General Electric  in the U.S., Siemens even made machines that plugged into the wall. However, all three European companies have turned away from high-voltage transmission projects as another electrification wave promises to decarbonize the economy.<br />Instead, the trio are focusing on the long-mooted industrial internet-of-things: using digital technologies to make buildings, industrial production and local power systems smarter and more efficient. They have “a clear strategy of walking away from project businesses and focusing on product businesses,” says Guillermo Peigneux Lojo, an analyst at UBS. The latter, which include digitization, software and services, tend to come with higher growth and profitability.<br />All three companies increased their revenue and profit outlooks on reporting quarterly results in recent weeks. Supply chains were stretched as demand recovered and customers built up stock, but they were able to increase prices, improving profits despite higher costs for raw materials, components and transport. Their digitization businesses were generally their most profitable, generating margins of between 17% and 21% in earnings before interest, taxes and amortization.<br />Siemens has for years been slimming down to focus on digital technology. It sold assets and spun off businesses such as medical equipment maker Heathineers and power producer  Siemens Energy ,  though it retains stakes in both. Siemens’ railway-focused mobility business was once another spinout candidate, but those plans have been shelved for now. Its enduring business units are digital industries, which focus on factory automation, smart infrastructure for buildings and a financing group.</td>

      <td>The first detailed results of the 2020 census, scheduled for release Thursday, are expected to show a nation that is aging, diversifying and continuing to grow faster in the South and Southwest.<br />The decennial census data might also show that the total white population shrank for the first time in U.S. history, with all of the nation’s growth attributed to nonwhite residents.<br />Demographers will be watching to see whether the U.S. crossed several other benchmarks, including the possibility that the white population dropped below 60% for the first time and whether white people will fall below 50% of the population that is younger than 18 years old.<br />The census also has been expected to document the continued depopulation of rural areas as cities and their suburbs grow and gain political sway.<br />The first census results—consisting only of population totals for states and the nation—were released in late April. The U.S. population reached 331 million last year, growing more slowly over the last decade than at any time since the 1930s.</td>

      <td>New applications for jobless benefits likely declined last week, indicating a healing labor market despite the uncertainty caused by the latest surge in coronavirus cases due to the Delta variant, economists say.<br />Economists estimate that first-time applications for unemployment benefits, a proxy for layoffs, fell to a seasonally adjusted 375,000 in the week ending Aug. 7, from 385,000 in the prior week, according to a Wall Street Journal survey. That would mark the third straight week of declines. The Labor Department will release the latest numbers at 8:30 a.m. EDT Thursday.<br />The number of new claims filed has held relatively steady since the beginning of June, in a range between 368,000 and 424,000. That is well below the roughly 6 million new claims filed in late March and early April 2020, but above the roughly 220,000 applications filed weekly in the months before the pandemic.<br />The claims data match with other indicators showing that momentum in the labor market and broader economy is continuing despite signs that the recent rise in coronavirus infections is starting to crimp some business activity.<br />The variant “certainly is a risk and it could dampen things a little bit,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist at Oxford Economics. “But our baseline view is that with each successive wave, the labor market and the economy has reacted less and less.”</td>

But this time exhaustion is amplified by something new: frustration over the insufficient uptake of vaccines that could have prevented most Covid-19 patients from landing in their care.<br />The Delta variant has pushed up U.S. Covid-19 infections to averages of about 100,000 a day, federal data show, levels last breached before vaccines were available to many Americans. Hospitalizations and deaths have climbed less sharply nationwide, but in some parts of the country where vaccination rates are lower, more people are hospitalized for Covid-19 than ever.<br />“The mood is more frustrated than anything,” said Claire White, an intensive-care-unit nurse at Mercy Hospital Northwest Arkansas in Rogers, Ark. More than 1,000 Covid-19 patients are hospitalized throughout Arkansas, according to federal data, nearing the state’s all-time peak in January of just under 1,200 patients.<br />“It’s too late for them to get the vaccine, and a lot of them are realizing it, so it’s been pretty demoralizing,” she said.<br />Earlier in the pandemic, healthcare workers tending to Covid-19 patients in overrun hospitals were lauded as heroes. Many self-isolated from family and loved ones for weeks or months to keep them safe. Some got sick or died. Many pushed forward to help ease the suffering as waves of patients moved through hospitals and ICUs.</td>

Some negotiated detailed contracts, before calling off the talks and realizing the offers were scams, the people said.<br />France doesn’t negotiate directly with distributors of vaccines but gets them through the European Commission, a spokeswoman for French President Emmanuel Macron said. Brazil didn’t end up buying vaccines that were offered by third-party brokers, President Jair Bolsonaro’s office said, although it confirmed there were talks. Latvia’s vaccines are purchased within the contracts signed by the European Commission and vaccine manufacturers, said a country representative.<br />Offers from people and companies to Austrian public agencies or the chancellery that appeared to be serious turned out to be dubious and were referred to authorities, an Austrian government spokesman said. Colombia received proposals from vendors who later dropped them after being pressed by the government to prove they were working with drugmakers, according to Germán Escobar, chief of staff for the Health Ministry. He said the country ultimately negotiated contracts directly with manufacturers. Meanwhile, Argentina only signed contracts directly with vaccine makers, a government spokesman said.</td>

Wholesalers fill buy and sell orders for the customers of online brokerages such as  Robinhood Markets Inc.  and TD Ameritrade.<br />Chicago-based Jump is a big player in global markets, despite its low profile and penchant for secrecy. The firm is active on futures, options and stock exchanges around the world and is a major trader of Treasurys and cryptocurrencies. It employs more than 900 people and has offices in the U.S., Europe and Asia.<br />Wholesalers generally make money by collecting a small spread between the buying and selling price of stocks, often just a fraction of a penny per share. Most are units of firms such as Citadel Securities or  Virtu Financial Inc.  that trade millions of shares each day.<br />Jump declined to provide the timing of the launch, saying it was still seeking regulatory approvals needed to operate the business. The firm decided several years ago to start a wholesaler, well before the recent trading frenzies in stocks such as  GameStop Corp.  and  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.,  the executives said.</td>

Nichols on Wednesday denied motions by Rudy Giuliani, pro-Trump attorney Sidney Powell and MyPillow Inc. and Chief Executive Mike Lindell to dismiss the lawsuits, rejecting their arguments.<br />The ruling by Judge Nichols, a Trump appointee, represents an early win for Dominion, one of the largest voting machine companies in the U.S., and exemplifies the legal fallout from the 2020 election. Allies of Mr. Trump have lost dozens of court cases in which they claimed widespread election fraud or wrongdoing. Federal and state officials have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud that could have changed the outcome of the presidential election.<br />A Dominion spokeswoman said the company was pleased to see the legal process moving forward.<br />Howard Kleinhendler, Ms. Powell’s attorney, said, “We now look forward to litigating this case on its merits and proving that Ms. Powell’s statements were accurate and certainly not published with malice.” He said that they will push to investigate Dominion as part of the legal discovery process.</td>

Outside government, some are publicly calling for Mr. Maher to be removed from the committee.<br />“He should be a witness on what did & didn’t happen at DHS leading up to & on Jan. 6.

      <td>The closely held European-based companies behind Fifty Shades of Grey vibrators and other sexual wellness brands said they have agreed to merge in a deal that values the combined company at around $1.2 billion, amid increasing global demand for sex toys fueled in part by the pandemic.<br />Germany’s WOW Tech Group is combining with Lovehoney, a U.K.-based online retailer, to offer a range of sex toys, lingerie, and lubricants to retailers and consumers. The companies could officially announce the tie-up as soon as Thursday.<br />The deal comes as homebound consumers during pandemic-induced lockdowns spurred demand for sexual wellness products. Together, WOW Tech and Lovehoney, which will be known as the Lovehoney Group, will be profitable and expect to generate sales of more than $400 million this year. That is about double the combined 2020 level, making it the world’s largest sexual wellness company measured by revenue, they say.<br />The merger, which values the combined group at more than €1 billion, equivalent to $1.2 billion, represents a bet that the sector’s growth can continue even as the rollout of vaccines allows more people to leave their homes and socialize in groups. Lovehoney Group will operate across North America, Europe and Asia, offering brands such as We-Vibe, Womanizer, and Arcwave. The companies are also betting on the additional scale allowing them to seek bigger acquisitions.<br />“Sexual well-being products have gained a mainstream position in today’s market,” said Johannes Plettenberg, WOW Tech’s current chief executive.

      <td>Real average hourly earnings have declined for seven months.</td>
      <td>The meaning of “transitory” is getting longer all the time. That’s one conclusion from the Labor Department’s report Wednesday for July that consumer prices rose 5.4% over the last 12 months. That’s two months in a row, after a 5% annual increase in May. When does transitory, in the Federal Reserve’s inflation lingo, become persistent?<br />White House economists looking for silver price linings can note that the monthly increase in the consumer-price index slowed in July to 0.5% compared to 0.9% in June. But the smaller increase was mostly due to used car prices stabilizing somewhat after months of astronomical growth. Inflation rose anyway.<br />Notably, the “core” CPI that strips out volatile energy and food prices increased 0.3% in July and 4.3% over the last 12 months. Prices last month rose for most goods and services including toys (0.4%), pet products (1.4%) and haircuts (2.2%). Rents climbed (0.4%) and have been accelerating.<br />Food prices surged 0.7% while restaurant meals rose 0.8%, the most since 1981. None of this is any surprise to Americans who have visited a supermarket or eaten out lately. Labor costs are rising as businesses have to raise wages to attract workers who can make more unemployed. The result: Higher prices.<br />The worker shortage is also contributing to supply-chain problems and raising rates for shipping, as well as causing delays in getting products to customers. Rising energy prices are feeding into higher production and transportation costs and ultimately consumer prices.</td>

      <td>A Chinese court sentenced Canadian businessman Michael Spavor to 11 years in prison on Wednesday. Beijing says he’s a spy, but Mr. Spavor is really the latest victim of the Communist Party’s hostage diplomacy.<br />Chinese police arrested Mr. Spavor and former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig in December 2018. They had the bad luck to be in China 10 days after Canada arrested Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou at U.S. request as she traveled through Vancouver. The U.S. alleges that she committed bank and wire fraud, which Ms. Meng denies.<br />In May 2020 a Canadian judge ruled that the charges against her could be considered crimes in the U.S. and Canada. Less than a month later, China charged Messrs. Spavor and Kovrig with espionage. The timing of Mr. Spavor’s sentence is also no coincidence, with an extradition decision for Ms. Meng near. The vague language of the sentencing pronouncement hinted that China may be willing to expel Mr. Spavor, which is one more sign that his arrest was political.<br />In a statement Wednesday, Marc Garneau, Canada’s minister of foreign affairs, condemned Mr. Spavor’s sentence and said the decision was “rendered after a legal process that lacked both fairness and transparency.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for the immediate release of the two Canadians and said that “people are not bargaining chips.”<br />They are in China. Neither the U.S. nor Canada can submit to this human blackmail, or it will happen any time a well-connected Chinese national is accused of breaking one of their laws. The countries will have to let the legal process play out while making clear how dangerous it now is to do business in China.</td>

      <td>The White House pleads for more foreign oil. The U.S.? Not so much.</td>
      <td>We thought we’d seen everything, but there it was Wednesday morning in black and white on the White House website: Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, imploring the cartel of oil exporting nations to pump more oil. Talk about a political climate change. This is the same Biden Administration that has spent six months doing everything it can to crush U.S. oil production.<br />“Higher gasoline costs, if left unchecked, risk harming the ongoing global recovery. The price of crude oil has been higher than it was at the end of 2019, before the onset of the pandemic,” Mr. Sullivan’s statement said. “While OPEC+ recently agreed to production increases, these increases will not fully offset previous production cuts that OPEC+ imposed during the pandemic until well into 2022. At a critical moment in the global recovery, this is simply not enough.”<br />Someone pass the smelling salts to Tom Steyer, the climate crusader who surely fainted when he heard that one. Oil production is beneficial? Fossil fuels are essential to economic growth? The world needs more petroleum to be burned to release more CO2 into the atmosphere?<br />Perhaps Mr. Sullivan missed Monday’s U.N. report that the world will soon be as hot as Hades if we keep pumping oil. In a single, brief statement, he managed to contradict President Biden’s entire energy message as a candidate and in office. But as it happens, Mr. Sullivan wasn’t talking out of his hat.<br />On Wednesday Brian Deese, the White House economic council chief, wrote to the Federal Trade Commission to investigate oil-price fluctuations. This is a hardy perennial whenever White House officials fret that rising gasoline prices are becoming an issue. Blame “anti-competitive” practices. Perhaps Mr. Deese found the letter in a White House file cabinet. This means inflation is showing up as a bigger political problem in the polls than Democrats let on.</td>

      <td>The same coronavirus media alarmism that worked against Donald Trump in 2020 is now eroding support for Gavin Newsom.</td>
      <td>Following a year of stay-at-home orders, crushing job losses and long-running school closures, the big question on Californians’ minds right now is whether Gov. Gavin Newsom will be recalled. A Survey USA poll of 11,000 people at the beginning of August found that 51% of Golden State voters would vote to remove the first-term Democrat. California’s recall election takes place on Sept. 14, with voters first choosing whether to recall the governor, and then selecting one of 46 candidates to succeed Mr. Newsom.<br />Incumbent politicians are usually only recalled when people are really unhappy, and looking back over the past year, Californians’ ire is obvious. In a video shared widely on social-media platforms in December, Angela Marsden, owner of the Pineapple Hill Saloon and Grill in Sherman Oaks, said, “[Los Angeles] Mayor Garcetti and Gavin Newsom are responsible for every single person that doesn’t have unemployment, that does not have a job, and all the businesses that are going under.”<br />Today the frustration continues, as masks return and everyone—including those who’ve been vaccinated—are advised to wear them indoors in areas of high transmission. And while Sacramento’s guidelines aren’t legally binding, cities like Los Angeles are mandating mask use indoors. Gov. Newsom blames the unvaccinated: “We’re at a point in this epidemic . . . where choice, individuals’ choice not to get vaccinated, is now impacting the rest of us in a profound and devastating and deadly way,”<br />In one of life’s ironies, the same coronavirus media alarmism that worked against Donald Trump in 2020 is now eroding support for Mr. Newsom. The hunter has become the hunted. And young people’s attitudes are changing. “The disease isn’t a big risk to them but they’re having to give up senior proms, 21st birthdays,” says Jillian Melchior, a Journal opinion page writer. “They’re having to spend their first year of college in their mom’s basement in front of a computer screen, and I really think some of them are going to resent this.”<br />Also frustrating for many voters is Gov. Newsom’s grandstanding on climate change. “This climate change is real,” he said on a tour of damage done by the Tamarack Fire in Douglas County, Nev., with Gov. Steve Sisolak, before taking a shot at anyone who might disagree: “You may not believe in science. You’ve got to believe your own damn eyes. Look around.” Most people accept that the climate is changing, but many also believe the fires across California are the result of poor forestry management. And periodic blackouts occur because the state’s mandates and subsidies for solar and wind power have left energy supplies short when it’s especially hot, a fact Mr. Newsom admitted in Aug. 2020: “Today we are anticipating substantially greater need for energy, roughly 4,500 megawatts, 4,400 to be precise, short, of where we believe we need to be.”</td>

      <td>They’ve wrecked the cities and the border. Why would climate policy be different?</td>
      <td>Notwithstanding that we are passing the 18th month of a global Covid-19 pandemic that has killed 4.3 million people and crushed national economies, the United Nations decided that what the world needs just now is more bad news, as summarized by the  New York Times : “The new report leaves no doubt that humans are responsible for global warming, concluding that essentially all of the rise in global average temperatures since the 19th century has been driven by nations burning fossil fuels, clearing forests and loading the atmosphere with greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane that trap heat.” What’s more, the report says climatic destruction is going to get worse no matter what we do. I do sometimes wonder what it would be like to be alive when the world ends.<br />The U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change even includes an interactive atlas depicting that global warming’s ruin will be everywhere, meaning there’s nowhere to hide. Now what?<br />My short answer: Don’t put the Democrats in charge of Noah’s Ark. It will sink.<br />If only for the sake of discussion, let’s stipulate the U.N.’s climate report may be right that warming is a problem. One still may pose a practical political question: Instead of mitigating the world’s climate challenge, what evidence exists that these progressive advocates—Democratic politicians or affiliated scientists—would do anything other than make it worse if we put them in charge of the solutions?<br />The currently observable reality is that progressives, who have now captured the Democratic Party at all levels of government, don’t seem able to run anything anymore—not cities, not Covid, not a national border. Why would letting them run climate policy be different?</td>

      <td>A history of Chinese labor and immigration in the United States, South Africa and Australia, from the 1850s to the present.</td>
      <td>In 1871, a Chinese immigrant named Chung Sun came to California with $600, hoping to establish a tea plantation. But shortly after his arrival in Los Angeles, a mob of hundreds stormed the city’s Chinatown. Though beaten and robbed, Chung Sun was among the more fortunate; as many as 19 of his countrymen died in the riot, some of them lynched from makeshift gallows. While educated and fluent in English, in the wake of the unrest Chung Sun could find work only as a ditch digger, and the sunny optimism that had lured him to America soon melted away. In short order he returned to his homeland, but not before publishing several letters in a local newspaper. As he explained in one missive: “In civility, complaisance, and polite manners, [Americans] are wholly wanting and are very properly styled barbarians.”<br />If the anti-Chinese violence that erupted sporadically in the United States after 1850—from the Pacific Coast to the Mountain West—was of a particularly brutal nature, historian Mae Ngai argues in her new book that the prejudice experienced by individuals like Chung Sun was sadly typical across the Anglo-American world during the global gold rush of the second half of the 19th century. Faced with an aggregate influx of more than 300,000 Chinese newcomers, various white settler societies grappled with what the book describes eponymously as “The Chinese Question,” which Ms. Ngai summarizes this way: “Were Chinese a racial threat to white, Anglo-American countries, and should Chinese be barred from them?” The answer to that query “played a central part in the making of white settler identity and the modern nation-state,” while bringing about “a new way of imagining, organizing, and governing the world.”<br />This is not the book Ms. Ngai set out to write. Instead, she began with a more circumscribed plan to “slay the coolie myth,” the tenacious if largely erroneous notion that Chinese laborers of this era were merely indentured servants—“slavish, without personality or will, and pathetically oppressed.” This idea took hold during the 19th-century Chinese diaspora, promulgated especially by white laborers in places such as California. These objections of the working class were rooted not in any humanitarian concern for the supposedly exploited Chinese; rather—as with their hostility to African-American chattel slavery (to which “coolieism” was often compared)—white Americans and European immigrants focused on the perceived injury to their own economic prospects, which they believed would suffer from competition with unfree workers. Cynical politicians mobilized this animosity to great effect. John Bigler, the third governor of California, won re-election in 1853 by leaning into the Chinese Question.<br />In the course of her research, however, Ms. Ngai uncovered striking parallels between the California gold rush and a pair of other mining frontiers in Australia and South Africa—both in geographical conditions and the process of indigenous dispossession that preceded resource extraction. But of much greater interest to the author is that all three societies “ultimately answered the Chinese Question with legislation excluding Chinese from immigration and citizenship,” including the so-called White Australia Policy (1901-73) and a general program of Chinese exclusion in South Africa (1880s-1980s). Likely more familiar to American readers is the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which, for the first time in U.S. history, used race as the basis for barring an entire group of immigrants; the law remained in effect until 1943. As Ms. Ngai explains, the issue of Chinese exclusion shifted the U.S. federal position on immigration from a matter of commerce to one of national security, where it resides today.<br />This is a work of towering ambition, which led Ms. Ngai—who teaches at Columbia University and is the author of two previous books, including an acclaimed study of illegal aliens in American history—to scour archives on five continents and to familiarize herself with several national histories to complement her primary expertise in U.S. history. There is good reason that many professional and popular historians opt for more narrowly drawn accounts of discrete events or individuals. But the payoffs of Ms. Ngai’s comparison are notable, among them the challenge to American exceptionalism as well as the illumination of key differences between her case studies. To wit: “Chinese enjoyed more favorable legal and social conditions” in Australia than in California, and in South Africa “the Native Question—the problem of how whites could control and exploit the Black majority”—loomed at all times over the Chinese Question (and everything else).</td>

      <td>Government shields its employees and beneficiaries, but not ordinary workers, from higher prices.</td>
      <td>The Labor Department reported Wednesday that consumer prices have risen in the past year by 5.4%. Prices have risen at an annualized rate of 7.1% in 2021 and 8.4% in the past three months. The underlying drivers of consumer inflation are rising at least as fast, with the annual Producer Price Index for 2021 up 10.6% through June and the Import Price Index up 15.8%.<br />With virtually every inflation warning light flashing red for the first time since the early 1980s, why is there so little concern in Washington about what a growing number of Americans fear is a building crisis? Congress is readying another $4 trillion to $5 trillion of spending fuel for the fire, the White House urges lawmakers to do more and do it sooner, and the Federal Reserve advocates, aids and abets. In America, those who work and sweat for a living gather around their kitchen tables trying to make ends meet as their dreams of homeownership or a new truck slip away. Is it possible that Washington and its principal constituencies are now so protected from inflation that to the president, House speaker and Senate majority leader a new wave of inflation is a small price to pay for the progressive dream of an America dominated by government?<br />Even a cursory accounting reveals the great divide between the protected and the unprotected. The seven largest benefit programs—Social Security, Medicare, Supplemental Security Income, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, civil-service retirement and military pensions—all automatically receive adjustments to benefit levels to offset the effects of inflation. This protection covers roughly 127 million people. And 169 million beneficiaries receive automatic inflation protection in programs ranging from Medicaid and ObamaCare tax credits to student loans, and any program whose eligibility is tied to the poverty rate, which itself is adjusted for inflation.<br />For those federal programs not automatically adjusted for inflation, Congress uses a budget process called “current services baseline” that sets the federal budget for every department, agency, program, project and activity at the previous year’s spending level plus an adjustment for inflation. In this wondrous world, more spending is not an increase unless it’s above the inflation rate, and an increase in spending by less than the inflation rate is deemed a cut.<br />In the past 75 years, total federal spending has grown by more than the inflation rate in all but 11 years. Those years mostly occurred after a previous surge in defense spending was reversed, such as after the U.S. exited from Iraq in 2011, or after a targeted spending surge, such as when the 2009 stimulus was spent out.</td>

      <td>Bravado aside, the DCCC knows voters are souring. But will the GOP capitalize?</td>
      <td>Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Sean Patrick Maloney was extraordinarily self-assured in an Aug. 2 NPR podcast. When asked whether Democrats will “lose their majority” next year, the New York congressman responded emphatically, “No, of course not.”<br />Democrats will retain control of the House, he reasons, because “we’re going to rebuild our country” with President Biden’s $3.5 trillion American Jobs Plan. This spending package includes climate initiatives like bigger subsidies for electric-car buyers and huge investments in so-called human infrastructure such as child care, universal pre-K, and community college—all free.<br />“We’re making a bet on substance,” Mr. Maloney said. Democrats are “going to build the future.”<br />He dismissed concerns about GOP influence over redistricting, saying if Republicans try “rigging this game,” then “well, I think that makes me proud to be a Democrat.” He was all confidence and verve, if a little smarmy.<br />It was an act. Politico later revealed that in a closed-door lunch the previous week, Mr. Maloney shared polling with colleagues showing Democrats behind Republicans by 6 points in generic ballot tests in battleground districts. If the midterms were today, he warned, Democrats would lose the majority.</td>

It is the first time an Arab Israeli party is part of the ruling coalition. I worked with my colleague Mansour Abbas of the Ra’am party and the Ministry for Social Equality on developing a plan for government investment in technology and research and development.<br />My vision is to use Israeli technology—the bedrock of our economy—to help people on the periphery of society.<br />Aptly dubbed Impact, the $100 million, five-year plan, aims to bridge a gap in tech jobs. Israel’s Arab community makes up around 20% of the country’s population but accounts for only about 2% of tech workers. The Jewish ultra-Orthodox demographic, with more than 12% of Israel’s population of 9.3 million, makes up only 3% of tech workers.<br />The plan aims to help the Arab community develop skills to work in science and technology. It will include educational programs, vocational training, and technology incubators for entrepreneurs and startups. We plan to establish technology and science centers for Arabs, an incubator hub with seed funding for promising minority entrepreneurs, and two new research-and-development centers, one of them for the Bedouin community.</td>
