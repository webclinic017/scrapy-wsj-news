This would have forced the U.S. conglomerate Discovery to sell its stake in TVN, which it owns through a Dutch company. The channel’s news division is highly critical of the Polish government.</td>

      <td>One calling card of the Biden Presidency has been its rush to sweep away restrictions on executive power. A purge at the Environmental Protection Agency has now become a legal case worth watching.<br />The suit was brought in October by S. Stanley Young, a scientist appointed to the EPA’s Science Advisory Board in 2017 and reappointed in 2020 for another three-year term. In March new EPA Administrator Michael Regan—20 days on the job—abruptly sacked the entire board and the agency’s Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee. He then restocked both with green cheerleaders. Any interested person or organization can make nominations for the board and committee, and Mr. Young, who worked as a statistician for the pharmaceutical industry, was renominated for both bodies after the purge. EPA passed him over.</td>

The anti-carbon czars have used this mandate to implement a cap-and-trade program, low-carbon fuel standard, electric-vehicle and renewable electricity mandates, among other regulations that raise costs for residents and businesses.</td>

      <td>While occupying Virginia the day after its secession, the dashing Col. Elmer Ellsworth became the North’s ﬁrst celebrity martyr.</td>
      <td>The flamboyant young Civil War hero Elmer Ellsworth went from household name to household god in a matter of months by paying for his irrepressible bravado with his life. First, even before the war began, the spruce, handsome Ellsworth had become a 19th-century-style American idol for public displays of martial showmanship that fit, and fueled, the militant spirit that overtook the country in the run-up to actual hostilities. Then, barely 24 years old, Ellsworth became the war’s first prominent Union casualty, whose death ignited mass mourning rivaled only by the public response to Lincoln’s assassination four years later.<br />Yet, as Meg Groeling acknowledges in her straightforward, deeply researched biography, the first in 60 years, Ellsworth is now largely forgotten by the general public. The author is onto something when she asserts that, in his day, the thrilling public saber-rattling that Ellsworth engaged in “readied the North for the eventuality of the war itself.” A veteran teacher and writer specializing in military history, Ms. Groeling has mined Ellsworth’s letters, his mother’s diaries and a host of original newspaper accounts to forge a vivid inquiry into his onetime star appeal.</td>

Now it seems that while activists may love to visit, fewer people want to live there. It is a striking change after a long period of robust D.C. population growth coinciding with massive expansion of the federal government.<br />President Joe Biden has been trying hard to make the federal government much bigger, but the fat of the land is suddenly not enough to entice people to stay. Could it be that D.C. residents have already grown tired of protest tourists? Possibly, but Washington is just one part of a larger trend. Looking at nationwide data, a clear picture emerges of people fleeing heavily governed jurisdictions for those with lighter bureaucratic burdens.</td>

But re-creating the sense of peril one felt—while trying to buy an Orange Julius, say, or get to a commuter bus circa 1979—is an essential element in what is in turn a serial-murder story, a police procedural and a cultural critique.<br />No one says it quite out loud, but underlying all else in this season 2 kickoff of Mr. Berlinger’s “Crime Scene” is the paradox of legislating morality: The more you criminalize, the more crime goes up. It was the great lesson of Prohibition. It’s also the unavoidable conclusion of a story that begins—in this telling at least—in flames.</td>

There are faux-intimate interviews with its directors and actors; a salute to the remarkable number of cast members who have died since the first film was released in 2001; and reminiscences by the kids who grew up playing the student body of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and still seem to exist in a bubble. There are only so many times one can listen to Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint (Harry, Hermione and Ron) talk about how close they were, what a remarkable experience the movies were and how important the Potter stories were to young people everywhere. What young people? Have they met any? As is the case with most of the other actors interviewed, the recollections are suffocatingly personal, self-important, repetitive and airless.</td>

Yet rather than risk speculating on the root causes of the gap, educators and administrators take a collective sigh of relief when the measures of the gap evaporate from the educational domain.<br />California has worked assiduously to eliminate the achievement-gap smoke alarms: no standardized testing at the state or local level, no high-school competency tests or exit exams, no benchmark testing and crimp SAT results.</td>

By the time the travel ban was instituted on Nov. 26, it was clear that the Omicron variant not only had spread widely in Africa but had already reached the U.S. and the European Union. The EU has yet to remove its travel restrictions, a punishing political strategy with no scientific basis.<br />When it comes to science, South Africa is at the forefront of genetic surveillance and viral structural analysis. The country has a stellar medical research community; the first heart transplant was performed there in 1967. South Africa was a beacon of transparency when it came to Omicron, the opposite of China’s behavior at the beginning of the pandemic. That makes it especially unfortunate that the U.S. and EU singled out South Africa, and at the heart of its summer tourist season. The message: being forthcoming on behalf of science led to punishment rather than reward.</td>

The habits of mind prevalent among democratic peoples and their leaders have left us vulnerable more than once, and thus bear some examination. The principal error is thinking that men like Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Ali Khamenei want what most Westerners want. They don’t.<br />The most immediate threat is that Mr. Putin will invade Ukraine or engage in related forms of reckless mischief. As during Mr. Putin’s seizure of Crimea in 2014, there is a sense of incredulity at his audacity, as well as confusion about his intentions. An unnamed senior administration official told reporters on Dec. 17: “The Russian people don’t need a war with Ukraine. They don’t need their sons coming home in body bags.

Mr. Zuckerberg trades shares in his company each trading day, ensuring that his diversification is done randomly and avoiding any possibility that he benefits from insider information. More executives should follow his lead, and the Securities and Exchange Commission might be smart to mandate they do.<br />The problem starts with CEO pay. It isn’t the canard that it is “excessive,” but a conundrum arises because CEOs are compensated primarily with company stock. This idea—a product of the early 1990s—revolutionized American corporations. By aligning the interests of CEOs and shareholders, equity pay reduced the temptation to build empires and focused corporate managers on creating value for shareholders.</td>

      <td>Great political leaders, with a tiny number of exceptions, are complicated people who possess both appalling flaws and magnificent virtues. Oliver Cromwell was not one of those exceptions. He sought and relished the demise of political enemies, hogged glory for military feats rightly belonging to others, perpetrated wartime atrocities, and equated God’s will with his own intentions. But he also undermined a class system that elevated birth over ability, dealt a death blow to the divine-right monarchy, and forced the English nation to reckon with the reality of religious—and, by extension, political—diversity. “He was,” Ronald Hutton writes in “The Making of Oliver Cromwell,” “courageous, devout, resolute, principled, intelligent, eloquent, able, adaptable and dedicated, but also self-seeking, unscrupulous, dishonest, manipulative, vindictive and bloodthirsty: definitely not somebody to be taken simply at his word.”<br />Mr. Hutton, a history professor at Bristol University, covers only Cromwell’s elevation to national fame: from his birth in 1599 to the end of the first English Civil War, when the parliamentarians destroyed the last forces of Charles I at the battles of Naseby and Langport in 1645. By that year Cromwell—who had no formal military training—had become a highly effective cavalry commander and lieutenant-general of the parliamentary army. He would go on to command the army in a string of decisive victories and rule the nation as Lord Protector. Mr. Hutton aims to give a clearer picture of this remarkable man’s origins and political rise.</td>

Independent artists with nowhere near Adele’s industry muscle have described delays of a year or more in getting physical copies of their albums made. Demand for vinyl LPs far outstrips supply, which is one of several markers that suggest the album as a music format is still very much alive—and will continue to endure into the future.</td>

      <td>A University of California ‘inclusive language guide’ seeks to avoid ‘baggage,’ but not literally.</td>
      <td>I once knew a magazine journalist who was addicted to metaphors. He was, so to speak, an alcoholic of metaphors. If he took one sip from the demon rum of analogy, he would be in the gutter by the end of the paragraph. His journalism suffered from what might be called cirrhosis of the prose.<br />My friend would sit down at his typewriter—this was a long time ago—and set out to tell a seemingly straightforward news story. But in the first or second sentence, his mind would be seized by an image (jaunty, visual, arresting), and pretty soon the seductive analogy would take over the story altogether, hijacking the news report that it was intended merely to embellish.</td>

      <td>Explaining the supply-chain crisis is like a blind man describing an elephant. It depends on where you grope. Drawing conclusions from a single point of contact can be misleading.<br />“An Insider Explains The Supply-Chain Crisis” by Tunku Varadarajan (Weekend Interview, Dec. 18) makes the reasonable point that shifts in consumer behavior contribute to the crisis. But demand for new ovens or toilet paper isn’t changing only because of the crisis. While timing and mix of demand will vary, the pandemic-related delays are caused by how disruptions affect the internal workings of the supply chain. The tanker stuck in the Suez Canal had a more consequential effect than the 4% shift of demand to services. Companies’ response to the crisis determine its duration and severity.</td>

      <td>In addition to the concerns you address in “The Supreme Court’s Covid Vaccine Test” (Review & Outlook, Dec. 21), it is alarming that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit gave little attention to the conscience of religious organizations and employees in lifting the stay on Covid vaccine mandates. In a mere footnote of a nearly 40-page opinion, Judge Jane Branstetter Stranch brushed aside such legitimate and Constitutionally protected concerns as “premature.”<br />The president should not be able to issue an edict through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and take over all companies with over 100 employees and the healthcare decisions of their employees. But the religious-liberty harm makes that abuse even worse. The Supreme Court should not reward President Biden’s abuse of federal regulation to bully religious organizations and people of faith into submission.</td>

In the past decade or so, clothing and footwear brands have recognized that generating conversation (particularly online) by creating something outlandish often serves their purposes better than creating something beautiful. As Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele said in a recent “60 Minutes” segment, “I like the ugly things.”<br />The trick here? Ugly sells, especially when it’s buzzy. On Gucci’s website a $1,250 sweatshirt with a freakish fanged creature printed on it is nearly sold out. As are ungainly $620 heeled espadrilles covered in ostentatious Gucci print. Other brands are finding clothes that land somewhere between playfully perplexing and genuinely off-putting just as bankable. Adidas’s Yeezy Foam RNNR, a sneaker that looks like a smushed, perforated turtle shell, has sold out and is now listed at more than double its $80 sticker price on resale sites like StockX. At the higher end, the boutiquey brand ERL is selling out of its $865 puffers with a Peter Max-esque shock of colors.</td>

      <td>A clause in an agreement with the African nation has stirred a flap over whether the country signed away financial control of Entebbe International Airport</td>
      <td>Chinese lending stemming from President Xi Jinping’s signature Belt and Road Initiative transformed economies across the developing world. Now, as bills are coming due in Uganda and elsewhere, attention is turning to how aggressively Beijing is enforcing contractual obligations even as it sometimes extends repayment periods.<br />A recent flap over Chinese financing to upgrade Uganda’s Entebbe International Airport has highlighted how Beijing’s leverage over borrowing nations can come down to contractual fine print.</td>

      <td>The latest attack on the Senator is among the most dishonest.</td>
      <td>Democrats are in recrimination mode after the implosion of their multi-trillion-dollar spending bill, and one dishonest narrative is that West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin is callous about child poverty. For months Mr. Manchin and these columns raised substantive concerns about monthly cash payments for families that Democrats have never bothered to address.<br />“Maybe Senator Manchin can explain to the millions of children who have been lifted out of poverty, in part due to the Child Tax Credit, why he wants to end a program that is helping achieve this milestone—we cannot,” the White House said. To paraphrase a line from the left’s favorite TV show about politics, “The West Wing”: This is not exactly a page out of Dale Carnegie.</td>

      <td>Oklahoma’s civil power is at risk, as a court order showed last week.</td>
      <td>The unraveling of state power in eastern Oklahoma is fascinating to watch—if you don’t happen to live there. The Supreme Court last year, in a case called McGirt, basically revived a set of historical Native American reservations, which now cover about two million people and the city of Tulsa. McGirt dealt only with “federal criminal law,” and its results in that sphere have been bizarre.<br />But the latest news is that a federal court has now applied McGirt to Oklahoma’s civil power—specifically, oversight of surface mining and reclamation. Judge Stephen Friot isn’t happy about his own ruling. But he says his order against the state is “legally unavoidable” and “a prime example of the havoc flowing from the McGirt decision.” The chaos, he adds, casts doubt on “core functions of state government,” putting Oklahoma “in a uniquely disadvantaged position as compared to the other forty-nine states.”</td>
