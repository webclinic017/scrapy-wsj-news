      <td>Races for Governor in odd years rarely illuminate the national political scene, but this year’s showdown in Virginia could be an exception. President Biden won the state by 10 points last year, and Democrat Terry McAuliffe is a familiar face for voters, having served as Governor from 2014-18. Why isn’t he running away with it?<br />That question has a few answers, but the upshot is that Virginia seems like a test of themes for next year’s midterms. With President Trump out of office and off  Twitter ,  can Republicans compete in suburbia again, as soccer moms get fed up with progressive excess in Washington or at their area school boards? Or are voters still worried enough about Mr. Trump to punish all Republicans?</td>

First came parents at school board meetings with T-shirts saying “Parents are not domestic terrorists.” Then 21 state school board associations distanced themselves from the letter. The Ohio, Missouri and Pennsylvania state associations cut ties altogether.</td>

That’s the reason to applaud the nine House Republicans who voted last week to hold Steve Bannon, the sometime Donald Trump counselor, in contempt for defying a Congressional subpoena.<br />The subpoena was issued by the special committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, and there are no doubt some partisan motives at play. Speaker Nancy Pelosi hopes the committee will find evidence to back up her claim that the riot was part of a larger plot to stage an “insurrection.” If so, it was the dumbest coup attempt in history, but the committee wants to ask Mr. Bannon about his role.</td>

      <td>Fortunately for posterity, modern surveys came much later. Lincoln had to gauge public opinion on his own.</td>
      <td>The opinion poll seems now to be at the center of contemporary American political life. So endemic is polling that it feels as if what a politician does is less important than whether the public approves or disapproves. Polls are a great mainstay of television news, filling in five or so minutes on an otherwise dull day. They are especially valuable to the standard politician, whose primary question is how to get re-elected. Approval or disapproval of his actions in polls may provide crucial clues.<br />Polls have been around for more than a century, though they only gained authority in the 1940s with the scientific pretensions of the polling procedures of George Gallup and the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at Cornell University. For years the accuracy of polling was challenged. Doubtless the greatest failure of the pollsters came with their confident assurance that Thomas Dewey and not Harry Truman would be elected president in 1948. Today critics continue to question some of the methods of the pollsters: their choice of population samples, their neutrality, sometimes the inanity of their questions.</td>

Fans would buy a scorecard for as little as a dime when they arrived, and by marking up little boxes that demarcated each inning they kept a running account of the game.</td>

You’re going to overcome it, and you are going to be anything you want to be.’ ” Ms. Rice said that blaming whites today for past racism strikes her as unproductive.

It has no existing business to analyze, only its unknown potential. Thus there’s no real basis for leaping to the assumption that the market is merely irrational in valuing the company between $2 billion and $8 billion, the trading range it has occupied since debuting a week ago.</td>

      <td>When Joachim Rudolph and his family left their farm in eastern Germany in February 1945, young Joachim had no way of knowing they were on the run, or that escape would become a defining theme of his life. As Helena Merriman recounts in “Tunnel 29: The True Story of an Extraordinary Escape Beneath the Berlin Wall,” what Joachim’s father couldn’t tell him, “because how do you tell a six-year-old any of this,” was that they were fleeing “from the Red Army. He’d heard about them last night on the radio, the Russian soldiers coming from the East, raping women and torching farms,” and he was desperate to get his family to Berlin before the Russians found them.<br />The Russians, however, were “only a day’s ride behind,” and as they overtook the Rudolph family and “millions of refugees like them,” the troops only stopped long enough to rape the women and take away the men—among them Joachim’s father, who will die in the Gulag. Stunned at how quickly their idyllic farm life had become a war-torn nightmare, Joachim, his mother and sister retreat back to their village, which they find already occupied by slightly kinder Russian officers.</td>

      <td>The record, whose creation caused deep rifts in the band, has been reissued in a remixed version that includes extras, outtakes and more.</td>
      <td>‘Let It Be” has always been the Beatles’ problem child. It began as a multimedia back-to-the-roots project, the plan was that the band would rehearse an album’s worth of new material that could be played live, without the electronic wizardry and orchestral sweetening that had become part of their toolbox. They would then perform these new songs in a single concert, perhaps in an exotic setting, which would be filmed and recorded for a television special and an LP. The director Michael Lindsay-Hogg was engaged to capture it all, in sessions that running from Jan. 2 through Jan. 31, 1969.<br />There were problems from the start. Having grown accustomed to developing their songs in the recording studio, often during all-night sessions, the Beatles were never entirely comfortable with the daytime rehearsals they had scheduled or the persistent filming of their working process, and they disliked the rehearsal venue, Twickenham Film Studios. Squabbles over arrangements led George Harrison to quit the band on Jan. 10, and in negotiating his return he demanded that they abandon Twickenham and all talk of a concert. The sessions continued in the basement studio at the Beatles’ Apple headquarters and on Apple’s rooftop, where on Jan. 30 they held an outdoor session as a concession to the original concert idea.</td>

      <td>Shudder’s six-part series provides a deep dive into horror icons like Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees.</td>
      <td>As timely as pumpkin spice and probably scarier, the six-part “Behind the Monsters” arrives for the Halloween season providing a deep dive into the paragons of modern horror—the franchises, as it were, of classic slasher movies and their innumerable sequels. If you don’t know Freddy Krueger from Jason Voorhees, it’s probably a plus: The wonkiness of the people contributing to this clip-happy, fanboy-friendly series is as entertaining as what they reveal, even if their fellow devotees probably know it all already.<br />For instance, it’s probably common knowledge at any Comic-Con that the Michael Myers mask—worn by the homicidal maniac of the “Halloween” movies—was originally a modified William Shatner model. (Once you’re told this, it’s impossible not to see Captain Kirk perpetrating the mayhem.) Actor Tony Todd still seems tickled that his agent arranged for him to get $1,000 per bee sting when he first played Candyman, who at certain dramatic moments appears swarmed by the insects, which also pour from his mouth. Chucky, the “hero” of the “Child’s Play” and “Chucky” movies—as well as episode 3 of this series—was inspired partly by the Cabbage Patch craze of the ’80s, and also by the contemporaneous My Buddy, a doll marketed to boys. The My Buddy theme song, inescapable then, will still give parents (or grandparents) the creeps.</td>

      <td>AS OF OCTOBER, fully vaccinated Americans are allowed to visit the United Kingdom without quarantine or pre-departure testing (though you will need to be tested on your second day in the U.K.). It’s perfect timing. In the last few months, an eclectic crop of new hotels has sprouted in some of the city’s best spots. From bedrooms above a 300-year-old pub on the edge of an ancient heath to a 350-room “super boutique” dead center in the theater district, here are our picks.<br />In Leicester Square, the Londoner exemplifies a new breed of hotels deemed the “super boutique,” which basically means it’s an urban playground with a grown-up vibe. Spread over 16 stories, eight of which are subterranean, it has 350 bedrooms, six bars and restaurants, two cinemas, a swimming pool, spa and gym. Yabu Pushelberg’s sleek design riffs on the theaterland location, with undulating walls that mimic curtains, massive chandeliers and its own mini stage for live music. Clever zoning and lighting make the vast building feel much smaller. It’s also deliciously fragrant thanks to a partnership with Diptyque, which has created scents for the different areas. For some of the best views in London—facing Nelson’s Column, Big Ben and the London Eye—book one of the top-floor suites or head to the rooftop lounge bar, where ex-Nobu chef Kuenhi Won oversees the Japanese menu. At ground level, there’s Joshua’s Tavern, named for artist Sir Joshua Reynolds, an 18th-century Leicester Square resident. You’ll find many of his paintings in the National Gallery, right behind the hotel. From about $550 a night</td>

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency; it’s easy to buy and, for individuals who want to speculate on its future value, easy to hold. All you have to do is download some software, pick a secure password, sign up to a crypto broker, transfer the bitcoin into your blockchain wallet and you’re done.

Nothing, though, to leave behind the seeds of a nightmare: The real world offers plenty of those as it is.<br />Mystery fiction readers are familiar with the concept of the “cozy mystery”—a category that has no precisely defined boundaries but can be said to contain both the genteel country-house murders of many Agatha Christie novels and the many 21st-century mystery series which combine homicide with eccentric characters in a small-town locale (recipes in the back).</td>

But diplomatic relations took place at a less exalted level, too—in far-flung consulates and embassies. David McKean, an ambassador to Luxembourg in the final year of the Obama administration, had the good idea of tracking America’s response to Germany’s rise by describing the milieu of America’s ambassadors and by assessing the policies they pursued and the actions they took. In “Watching Darkness Fall,” he tells the story largely through the eyes of the men who represented the U.S. in London, Moscow, Berlin, Paris and Rome during the pivotal early years of Franklin Roosevelt’s administration.<br />Of the half-dozen ambassadors most prominently on display, William Dodd comes across as the book’s hero. Dodd served unhappily in Berlin from 1933 to 1937, regularly expressing his antipathy to Hitler and his government. Soon after he arrived, Hitler decreed that the Nazis were the only political party in Germany, and his cabinet authorized a series of draconian policies. In his first letter to Roosevelt, the ambassador made a comment that has resonance today: “The [German] people have never learned the give-and-take of group compromises, which English and Americans always apply.” Dodd dutifully attended the 1936 Berlin Olympics, a showcase for the Nazis, but refused to attend their rallies or host German officials in the embassy. Oddly, Mr. McKean never mentions that Dodd’s daughter not only shared his disgust but also spied for the Soviet Union, falling in love with a Russian agent and feeding him information about her father’s activities and his correspondence with Roosevelt.</td>
