At least that beats the decline of 2.4% in real wages over the entire year. That’s how much inflation has eroded the American standard of living and how it turned 2021 into a lost year for the average worker.<br />The Labor Department said Wednesday that the consumer-price index rose 0.5% in December, or 7% in the last year. That’s the highest annual rate since 1982, when Paul Volcker was trying to wring inflation out of the economy with Ronald Reagan’s political support. The current inflation has caught the Federal Reserve and Biden Administration entirely by surprise, and they’re still not sure what to do about it other than to blame someone else.</td>

Last week it increased its order of  Pfizer ’s  antiviral Paxlovid by 10 million. Great, but these treatments will probably arrive after the Omicron Covid variant crests. Why didn’t it order more treatments sooner?<br />That’s an especially good question given that the stated purpose of Democrats’ $1.9 trillion spending bill last March was Covid relief. Yet less than 1% of the spending was allocated for therapies. About as much money was given last year to New York’s financially ailing transit system as the Administration spent procuring Covid therapies. The result: A persistent treatment shortage and countless preventable deaths.</td>

Mr. Leonard does, however, include one pointedly humorous moment that sheds light on so much of his subject matter.<br />The joke comes when he recounts an exchange among policy makers during a 2012 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The committee was in the throes of a monthslong argument about whether and how to expand the Fed’s easy-money policies. Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed, chimed in with a warning. Texas Instruments, a major employer in his district, wasn’t treating existing Fed policies such as near-zero interest rates as a spur to investment and job creation. The company was merely reconfiguring its balance sheet toward cheaper debt financing and away from equity funding. This ran counter to the Fed’s theories about how its decisions filter through to the Main Street economy. To which Chairman Ben Bernanke replied: “President Fisher . . . I do want to urge you not to overweight the macroeconomic opinions of private-sector people who are not trained in economics.”</td>

Night Shyamalan—who gained notoriety for blockbusters like 1999’s “The Sixth Sense” and 2002’s “Signs”—is currently writing the shortest film script of his career. He’s also producing something of a modern-day unicorn: a half-hour TV drama. “At my core, I am a minimalist,” said the filmmaker. “When you put limitations on what you’re working on, that’s when you find your voice and your beauty.”<br />The third season of that unicorn, the  Apple  TV+ thriller “Servant,” for which Mr. Shyamalan serves as showrunner, executive producer and sometimes director, drops January 21. Its premise—a grieving couple hires a nanny to help care for the doll that has replaced their dead child—could easily sustain one-hour episodes. But delivering the story in 30-minute bites, Mr. Shyamalan said, allows him to focus on the few themes that ground each episode. Similarly, in writing a tight script for his next feature, “Knock at the Cabin,” he’s learned that every line and every moment has to earn its place in the film.</td>

This is the same argument we heard in the mid-1970s.<br />When we both began our careers in public service, the U.S. was suffering from the high inflation of the late 1970s. The federal government had squandered a decade in denying that its policies had anything to do with inflation. Politicians made convenient scapegoats out of big oil, big banks, big communications and even big grocers. Government made the problem worse with price controls, investigations into price fixing and antitrust actions. It embarrassed itself with WIN (Whip Inflation Now) buttons and Inflation Gardens. Mounting voter outrage finally ended the charade.</td>

I went to that shrine of knowledge and prediction because, if the past two years have shown us anything, it’s that we really have no idea what the future holds. I needed to see something, anything, that I hadn’t seen before. I also wanted to understand how the ancients had dealt with their crises of doubt and anxiety and the basic human inability to see what’s coming.<br />Delphi is where the uncertain have always gone to ease their uncertainty, a place of pilgrimage since before recorded history. One of the first travel writers, Pausanias, described it extensively in his tourist guide to the ancient world, around 1,800 years ago. Scholars consider the roughly 100-mile-long walk from Athens to Delphi’s Temple of Apollo among the oldest continuously used footpaths in the world. It’s one of the first trips people took with the goal of trying to figure things out.</td>

To adequately gauge vaccine and booster efficacy, we must also consider the T cells, or cellular response.

With Turo, “guests can take the wheel of the perfect car for any occasion, while hosts can take the wheel of their futures,” the company says. The elevator pitch that Turo can be the  Airbnb  of car sharing might have merit, but the numbers show it isn’t there yet.</td>
