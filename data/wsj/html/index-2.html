      <td>Chaos eases at the airport, but thousands are still stranded in Kabul and across the country.</td>
      <td>The Biden Administration would rather no one noticed, but the evacuation from Kabul of Americans and the Afghans who assisted the U.S. has a long way to go. One danger is that the White House will withdraw U.S. troops too soon once again, leaving tens of thousands to the tender mercies of the Taliban.<br />The rare good news is that by Tuesday the U.S. military had gained control of the Kabul airport, which has a military and a civilian wing. Several thousand U.S. troops are at the airport, and Americans, foreign nationals and some Afghans are able to leave on military or charter flights. Afghans are no longer risking death by clinging to the outside of a C-17 cargo plane as it takes off.<br />But that still leaves an unknown number of Americans, and thousands of Afghans targeted by the Taliban, stranded in Kabul and the rest of the country. Amid the chaos of the weekend and Monday, the State Department advised Americans to shelter in place and not risk a trip to the airport. But how are people going to get there now amid all of the Taliban checkpoints and AK-47s?<br />The U.S. military could venture out to rescue them, assuming they can be located. But that’s a mission President Biden is unlikely to approve given his pledge not to put one more American soldier at risk and what must be a White House fear of American hostages in Taliban hands. He’s already had to redeploy more troops to the country than were there before he decided to withdraw in April.<br />That leaves negotiating with the Taliban. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Tuesday that the Taliban has agreed to allow “safe passage” for civilians, presumably Americans and foreign nationals. That’s good news, though we’d like to know what the U.S. agreed to in return. Formal recognition? Foreign aid? You’d think all of the U.S. military equipment they’re confiscating would be enough compensation, but the jihadists know that Mr. Biden wants out—and fast.</td>

      <td>It’s too early to know the wider strategic fallout from America’s botched Afghanistan withdrawal. But there’s strong reason to doubt convenient claims that the retreat will help the U.S. balance a revisionist China. Beijing is more likely to see the display of fecklessness as an opening to exploit.<br />“Our true strategic competitors, China and Russia, would love nothing more than the United States to continue to funnel billions of dollars in resources and attention into stabilizing Afghanistan indefinitely,” said President Biden in his defiant Monday speech.<br />Put aside that, because of the Taliban triumph, the U.S. now has more attention and troops devoted to Afghanistan than it did before the exit. Beijing is already using the debacle to taunt Taiwan and the U.S.<br />“Is this some kind of omen of Taiwan’s future fate?” said an editorial in the Global Times, a Communist Party organ. “Once a cross-Straits war breaks out while the mainland seizes the island with forces,” the paper added, “the US would have to have a much greater determination than it had for Afghanistan, Syria, and Vietnam if it wants to interfere.”<br />China’s Foreign Ministry also took a victory lap in a press briefing Tuesday. Its spokeswoman said the Afghanistan war shows that the U.S. shouldn’t “interfere in other countries’ internal affairs,” pointedly using the same language Beijing uses to object to America’s support of Taiwan’s independence. China says Taiwan’s status is an “internal” issue, though the self-governing democracy is a linchpin of security for Pacific states including Japan.</td>

      <td>The average family of four will get more than they spend on food.</td>
      <td>What a telling juxtaposition. Amid the throes of its Afghanistan retreat, the Biden Administration on Monday announced a giant food-stamp expansion. Democrats are shrinking the U.S. military footprint around the world so they can expand the welfare state at home.<br />The Department of Agriculture (USDA) is increasing benefits by an average of 27% over pre-pandemic levels under the guise of updating its Thrifty Food Plan. This is the basket of foods that the government uses to determine benefit size, which averaged $130 per person monthly before the pandemic. Benefits are adjusted annually for food inflation.<br />Progressives complain that the basket hasn’t changed since 2006 despite the government’s changing nutritional standards, which recommend people eat more lean protein, fruits and vegetables and whole grains—all of which tend to be more expensive. Ergo, USDA is now sweetening the average benefit by a whopping 27% over pre-pandemic levels.<br />Congress increased benefits by 15% during the pandemic, though this fillip is set to end in September. The Administration’s regulatory expansion will be permanent. A family of four will get up to $835 per month after adjusting for inflation. The average four-person household in the U.S. spent only $537 per month on food at home in 2019.<br />USDA hilariously says that Americans need to consume more calories because they are fatter. It has also adjusted its food basket to include more protein and dairy, which happen to be food products whose prices are increasing most. Milk prices were up 6.2% year-over-year in July and meat 5.9%.</td>

      <td>They belatedly realize the Taliban is a greater threat than America.</td>
      <td>There’s plenty of shame to go around as the Taliban retakes Afghanistan, and don’t forget the global human-rights establishment. Having built a cottage industry denigrating the American military—and the U.S. in general—they’re suddenly discovering how powerless they are to protect vulnerable Afghans without American intervention.<br />It starts at the top, with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. “The world is watching,” he admonished an emergency session of the Security Council Monday. “We cannot and must not abandon the people of Afghanistan.” To show he means business, he even tweeted the message. Oh, also: “It is essential that the hard-won rights of Afghan women and girls are protected,” Mr. Guterres said.<br />Just don’t ask by whom. The real question isn’t what Mr. Guterres or anyone else at the U.N. will do substantively to protect Afghanistan’s women and girls or other vulnerable individuals. The answer is nothing. The question is how long it will take before the worthies in Turtle Bay hand Afghanistan’s seat in the General Assembly to the new Taliban government. This being the U.N., a seat on the Human Rights Council won’t be far behind.<br />Other political leaders are sounding similar notes. “Afghan women have the right to live in freedom and dignity,” French President Emmanuel Macron said Monday. He also fretted about a potential new wave of emigration to Europe—which “would endanger the migrants” and, perhaps more relevant, endanger his political prospects. German Chancellor Angela Merkeldescribed the weekend’s events as “a terrible development for the millions of Afghans who want a more liberal society.”<br />The French and Germans sacrificed blood and treasure fighting with the U.S. and other NATO allies in Afghanistan in what Europeans thought of as “the good war” (in contrast to the U.S. mission in Iraq). They have good reason to be angry with the Biden Administration’s botched pullout. But the episode makes clear again that, without U.S. leadership, Europe lacks the will and capacity to stop the Taliban or other global rogues.</td>

      <td>Nonprofits and lawmakers have sounded warnings for months, but the administration dithered.</td>
      <td>‘Dear Sir/Madam,” the email begins, “Please relocate me soon before i die.” Sent on Tuesday to nonprofit officials, a U.S. House staffer and State Department addresses, the message at first reads like an internet scam. Yet this 31-year-old Afghan wants safe passage, not money. “Militant talibans looking for me to find me to slaughter me,” he writes. “Thank God I left Kandahar city and I am hiding myself in Kabul.”<br />The Afghan, whose name is withheld to protect his safety, had applied for a Special Immigrant Visa and attached his case number. The program was created in 2006 for Iraqis and Afghans who worked for the U.S. government, most notably as translators. After serving, they and their family become eligible for permanent U.S. residency. This is perhaps America’s most just and sensible immigration policy: English-speaking foreigners who follow the rules and risk everything—and sometimes save American lives—can earn a shot at the American Dream.<br />It isn’t clear exactly how many Afghans are eligible or currently winding through the process. The latter figure stood below 20,000 when President Biden announced the U.S. withdrawal in April, but it almost certainly has risen as the Taliban gained territory. In recent years the application process could take more than 500 days, and the pandemic didn’t help. The State Department approved 1,799 SIVs for Afghans in fiscal 2020, down from 9,741 the year before.<br />Thousands have made it to the U.S. through the program, but hundreds of translators and family members have been killed while waiting for approval. Now, with the extremist group in power, thousands could face a similar fate.<br />The problem didn’t begin with the Biden administration, but the White House has done almost nothing to resolve it. State instead maintained the delusion that the U.S. could keep a diplomatic presence in Afghanistan and continue processing visas well into the future.</td>

      <td>As with many adventures in decolonization, the 1974 coup in Portugal that led to the independence of Angola and Mozambique worked out better for the colonizers than the colonized.<br />The Portuguese got an end to the Salazar dictatorship, a start down the road to democracy and modernity. Their African colonies got an exodus of most of their professional and technical experts, followed by an economic collapse and decades of violence and poverty.<br />Other colonial powers found at least somewhat less nakedly cynical ways of leaving. The British kept up Commonwealth ties with their ex-colonies; the French maintained many financial and institutional links. America’s departure from Afghanistan is a lot more like Portugal’s. However much Washington wants to see a failure of the Afghan state, the U.S. long ago became the state in Afghanistan. It supplied a social infrastructure Afghans were never likely to build on their own, pluralistic, wearing its Islam lightly.<br />True, 155 million Americans voted in 2020 for presidential candidates who favored withdrawal. Voters might or might not have felt differently if told a new truth. We weren’t just holding off terrorism. We had given half of Afghans (median age 18) the only order they ever knew. We had birthed an unlikely experiment in modernity that might prove useful in our long confrontation with militant Islam. Now we’ll never know.<br />President Biden at one time exhibited wisdom about a transitional presidency: “Look, I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else.” Then he discovered himself to be a transformative FDR-like president. He detected a sweeping mandate unseen by anyone except his White House toadies. (Perhaps it was tucked inside all those mail-in ballots.)</td>

      <td>America rescued them 20 years ago. How can we abandon them to the Taliban again?</td>
      <td>‘Take your shoes off and run for your life!” a Secret Service agent shouted at me and other women at the White House on Sept. 11, 2001. As the origins of the attacks were uncovered, America and the international community learned about the brutality of the Taliban, including its barbaric treatment of female Afghans. They prohibited girls from being educated, imprisoned women in their homes, and often subjected them to violence, humiliation, torture and gruesome executions.<br />Laura Bush gave a Presidential Radio Address in November 2001—the first time a first lady had done so—to raise awareness of the plight of Afghan women and girls. President Bush and Afghan President Hamid Karzai formed the U.S. Afghan Women’s Council, which launched dozens of programs to help women and girls in Afghanistan rebuild their lives. These hard-won gains are in grave jeopardy because of the slapdash U.S. withdrawal.<br />Our attention needs to be on the lives and futures of the Afghan people, especially women and girls, who made enormous progress over the past 20 years. Girls have been educated; women run businesses and serve as soldiers, police officers and provincial mayors. Women have been trained as physicians, allowing access to healthcare for the first time in decades, since there were restrictions on seeing male doctors under Taliban rule.<br />Afghan women are some of the most courageous, shrewd, resilient and inspiring women that I have had the privilege of working with in my life. How can we abandon them now to the horrific fate that awaits them under the Taliban again?<br />The Biden administration and Congress must take action to cut the red tape for Afghans seeking visas, and work with allied countries to provide a safe haven for them. They must resolve to re-engage and assert U.S. power and influence with the Taliban to demand protections for women and girls and forbid violence against them.</td>

      <td>Democrats need to take responsibility for their $5.4 trillion spending spree.</td>
      <td>Senate Democrats have passed a $3.5 trillion budget resolution, unlocking their ability to pass a tax-and-spend boondoggle later this fall. This comes on the heels of the $1.9 trillion package enacted along partisan lines and dubiously marketed as Covid-19 relief. Democrats didn’t care about the ramifications of their spending then, and most don’t seem to mind the $3.5 trillion price tag so long as it achieves the progressive policy objectives of their far-left base. But they insist on Republican support for raising the debt limit.<br />Congress’s previous two-year suspension of the limit expired at the end of July. Legislative action by this fall at the latest is needed to keep the federal government from defaulting on its debt before the Treasury’s “emergency measures” are exhausted.<br />Democrats could have included a solution to the debt limit in their budget resolution, which needs only a simple majority to pass. They refused, apparently for the purpose of creating a political crisis they can use as leverage over Republicans.<br />Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently said she views raising the debt limit as a “shared responsibility” between Republicans and Democrats. I would have agreed last year, when the parties worked together to confront an unprecedented crisis by passing five bipartisan Covid-19 relief packages that saved the economy from the brink and expedited the deployment of safe and effective vaccines.<br />But Democrats no longer recognize federal appropriations as a shared responsibility when they use the budget-reconciliation process to push for $5.4 trillion in new spending on partisan initiatives. The quest to spend money for the sake of spending money has already created a steady rise in inflation, with consumer prices up 5.4% last month.</td>

      <td>The development of planes and airships signalled a new era of polar exploration—along with new opportunities for disaster.</td>
      <td>On May 24, 1928, Gen. Umberto Nobile and his crew aboard the airship Italia—code-named N-4—dropped Italian flags and a small wooden cross given them by Pope Pius XI onto the North Pole from 450 feet in the sky. Airships were a technological marvel of the early 20th century, and the Italia’s goal was to land men at the North Pole, something that had never been done before. But bad weather thwarted the mission; returning to its base on Norway’s Svalbard archipelago, the Italia crashed into the ice, triggering one of the greatest polar rescue efforts ever mounted, a saga that journalist Mark Piesing retells in “N-4 Down: The Hunt for the Arctic Airship Italia.”<br />Until the so-called machine age, attempts to penetrate the Arctic’s nearly 6 million square miles of frozen seas had depended on surface vessels. As Mr. Piesing notes, planes and airships changed everything, a fact not lost on Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, the victor of the 1911 race to the South Pole. In 1915, Amundsen obtained Norway’s first civilian pilot’s licence. Ten years later, after numerous failed attempts to reach the North Pole via plane, he approached Umberto Nobile, an Italian air-force officer who had designed a prototype airship and had ambitions of his own to fly to the North Pole.<br />Italy’s dictator Mussolini agreed to sell the N-1, as Nobile’s airship was called, to Norway. Though the ship was renamed the Norge, for “Norway,” Nobile would pilot the craft, and six of the 16 crewmen would be Italian. From the outset, personal rivalries between Amundsen and Nobile tainted the venture, which was nonetheless a success. In May 1926, the Norge flew from Svalbard over the North Pole and landed in Alaska. Nobile enjoyed and exploited his new celebrity. An aggrieved Amundsen, convinced that Nobile was seizing all the glory for himself, announced his retirement from exploration.<br />Nobile, Mr. Piesing relates, almost immediately began planning another Arctic expedition, undaunted by Mussolini’s lack of enthusiasm or the jealousy of Italo Balbo, the head of the Italian air force, who viewed Nobile as a rival yet allowed him to use the N-4, another airship that Nobile had designed. Among the Arctic flights that Nobile planned, again from Svalbard, was one to the North Pole, where this time he hoped to land men.<br />The Italia left Svalbard on May 23, 1928, and early the following day reached the North Pole. The jubilant crew members celebrated by toasting one another with eggnog and playing the Italian Fascist Party anthem on a gramophone. High winds prevented a landing, so Nobile set course back to Svalbard. The wind slowed the Italia on its return, and at one point the helm controls jammed. Freezing fog, meanwhile, prevented Nobile from calculating his position accurately. Even more seriously, the airship began icing up. The crew lost its battle to stay airborne, and the Italia plunged onto the ice, tail first.</td>

      <td>‘The Covid pandemic is still casting a shadow on economic activity,’ the Fed chairman says</td>
      <td>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said it remains to be seen how the U.S. economy will weather the recent Covid-19 surge, in comments that offered no views on the outlook for monetary policy.<br />“It’s not yet clear whether the Delta [coronavirus] strain will have important effects on the economy; we’ll have to see about that,” Mr. Powell told students and teachers Tuesday during a virtual event held by the central bank.<br />Mr. Powell’s comments on the health situation follow those he made on the topic after the Fed’s policy meeting in late July. He said then that “with successive waves of Covid over the past year and some months now, there has tended to be less economic—less in the way of economic implications from each wave, and we will see whether that is the case with the Delta variety.” He added, “We don’t have a strong sense of how that might work out. So we’ll just be monitoring it.”<br />Mr. Powell, in a question-and-answer session with students and teachers on Tuesday, didn’t comment on what is next for central bank policy or detail how he expected the economy to perform over coming months. He did say that the economy is unlikely to return to how it was before the pandemic, as sectors reorganize themselves, and added that some groups that were hard hit by the pandemic have yet to fully recover.<br />Mr. Powell also said the recovery isn’t complete. “The Covid pandemic is still casting a shadow on economic activity. It is still very much with us. We can’t, you know, we can’t declare victory yet on that,” he said.</td>

      <td>Some Democrats want to vote on infrastructure bill alone while House speaker intends to pair it with $3.5 trillion broader measure</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Top House Democrats said the chamber would move forward with voting on the budget blueprint for a $3.5 trillion healthcare, education and climate package next week, rebuffing demands from a group of centrist Democrats to first vote on a $1 trillion infrastructure bill and urging their caucus to stay unified around President Biden’s agenda.<br />“I would hope that none of us, that none of us, would do or say anything that would jeopardize passing these bills. These bills are critical for us maintaining our majority, and that must reign supreme,” Democratic Whip James Clyburn (D., S.C.) told members on a Tuesday telephone call, according to a person listening to it.<br />In the narrowly-divided House, Democrats can afford no more than three defections. None of the nine centrist Democrats who have demanded the infrastructure vote first spoke about the issue during the call, according to a lawmaker who participated.<br />After the call, Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D., N.J.), one of the moderates, said his position hadn’t changed. If the infrastructure bill was “good enough for Bernie Sanders and 50 Democratic senators, why can’t we just move forward?” he said. “I’m hearing from local leaders—from the building tradespeople who build these tunnels, bridges and roads—they’ve got one message to me: Get it done now.”<br />The group of centrists had previously rejected an overture from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) to pass a procedural motion encompassing both the infrastructure bill and the $3.5 trillion effort. Mrs. Pelosi and top House Democrats’ decision to wait to pass the infrastructure bill until Democrats finish the $3.5 trillion effort is a response to the demands of progressive Democrats.</td>

      <td>A major retrospective at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art ranges widely, revealing the artist’s uncanny prescience when it came to creativity and technology.</td>
      <td>San Francisco<br />Nam June Paik (1932-2006) is often called the “father of video art.” But he’s much more than that, as the career-spanning, internationally traveling retrospective at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art makes clear. Organized by Rudolf Frieling of SFMoMA and Sook-Kyung Lee of the Tate, with SFMoMA’s Andrea Nitsche-Krupp, “Nam June Paik” is making its sole North American stop in the Golden State. With over 200 works in an abundance of media, it’s a detailed portrait of a singularly forward-thinking artist whose influence is strongly felt today.<br />If the Korean-born Paik is pigeonholed by art history for his work with video, it’s because the screen was the most ubiquitous element in a career that is otherwise hard to categorize thanks to the sheer variety of ideas it grappled with: Zen Buddhism, sex and classical music, and interconnectivity in a world of global broadcasting, just to name a few. And beyond using film in the same way a painter uses brushes and pigments, video itself is usually only one small part of a much larger project. Aside from videos, the show also includes LPs, collage, photography, sculpture and more by this omnivorous talent. Paik may be the father of video art, but he’s also a composer, a designer, a VJ, a conceptualist, a performance artist and a futurist.<br />We get an idea of Paik’s catholic creative mind in the first gallery with “TV Buddha” (1974), in which an 18th-century wooden Buddha sits, staring straight ahead into a television screen that displays his own image, broadcast via a closed-circuit camera. On the one hand, it’s a humorous play—and Paik often laced his work with humor—on (self-)reflection, enlightenment and the challenges of meditation. However, it’s also a tongue-in-cheek warning about vanity and carefully crafted public images in the age of television.<br />The following gallery steps back to 1963 to examine Paik’s first solo exhibition, “Exposition of Music—Electronic Television” at the Galerie Parnass in Wuppertal, West Germany. Filling all three floors of that exhibition space with immersive and interactive works, a practice common in today’s contemporary art world, Paik’s show was groundbreaking for its time. Drawing from his training in classical music and relationships with avant-garde composers such as John Cage, whom Paik met in Germany after moving there from Japan in 1956, this was the first of many experiments in which the artist tried to tear down the barriers between visual art and music, and between audience and artist.</td>

Here’s what we know so far.<br />Elizabeth Holmes dropped out of Stanford University at 19 years old to start the company that became Theranos, a startup that promised to revolutionize the blood-testing industry. After operating largely in secret for a decade, Theranos began in 2013 touting its technology, which it said could test for dozens of health conditions with a few drops of blood extracted from a finger prick, eliminating the need for large needles and vials of blood.<br />The company said it wanted to make blood testing more user-friendly and offered tests at rates that were lower than competitors.<br />Theranos announced a partnership with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. in September 2013 that put Theranos centers in Arizona and California pharmacies, and had signed a major deal with the Safeway Inc. grocery store chain. The company’s valuation eventually reached more than $9 billion.<br />The Wall Street Journal began reporting on questions about Theranos in 2015, revealing that only a few tests could be performed on its proprietary technology and that most were being run on traditional machines, including some that Theranos altered to work with diluted finger-prick samples.</td>

Although the U.S. and other allied governments haven't recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan, its control of the main organs of the state—including the central bank and other offices that house government coffers—make it the de facto power.</td>

      <td>American retreat has brought feelings of anger, guilt and frustration to many veterans who feel the U.S. has betrayed Afghan allies</td>
      <td>Marine Corps veteran Peter James Kiernan has been helping his Afghan interpreter apply for a U.S. visa since 2015. On Monday, he urged the man to burn the trove of documents he had helped him painstakingly collect over a decade to prove he worked for the U.S., as the Taliban took over Kabul and reports came in that they were conducting house-by-house searches.<br />Mr. Kiernan is angry and frustrated. “I wish I knew who to blame,” he said. “I can’t wait until we hold these people to account for this betrayal. There were definitely people in power who decided this was not a priority.”<br />The Afghan interpreter spent Monday hiding in Kabul with his wife and three children, Mr. Kiernan said, while the former marine now spends much of his day calling people, hoping to shake loose visas so that his old colleague can fly out before it is too late. He says he calls his friend in Afghanistan every 12 hours to check in.<br />Many military veterans say they forged lasting bonds with Afghan interpreters who ate meals with them, bunked alongside them and, on occasion, saved their lives. The Taliban’s victory over Afghan forces this week has left tens of thousands of American allies stuck and at risk, and is prompting frantic efforts by military vets to get their former colleagues out. It has brought feelings of bitterness and guilt to many veterans who feel bonded to their Afghan friends and has even left them embarrassed by how the U.S. has seemingly abandoned those who were so loyal.<br />“Some of these guys are absolutely special,” Mr. Kiernan said of Afghans who helped Americans during the 20-year military presence there. “It’s not like we didn’t know this was coming. I’m especially bitter that we’ve forsaken the bonds of camaraderie and abandoned our allies.”</td>

      <td>BOB COSTAS might be living in a technological world—in which you can video chat with family while your Tesla effectively drives itself—but he’s never quite managed to take modern car stereos for granted. “It still boggles my 20th-century mind that I can be driving through Pasadena while listening to the Cardinals from St. Louis on the radio,” the veteran sportscaster said.<br />A self-described technophobe, Mr. Costas, 69, still likes to hold each of the half-dozen newspapers he subscribes to in his hands; he prefers thick tomes to slim Kindles; and he just recently picked up an iPhone after defiantly swearing by his dusty Pantech flip phone for about 15 years by his own estimation. (”I’m glad I switched over and entered the 21st century,” he admitted, referring to his smartphone purchase.)<br />TV is one technology Mr. Costas knows intimately, having won 29 Emmys for news and sports during his more than four decades covering Major League Baseball, the NBA, horse racing, as well as a dozen summer and winter Olympics for NBC. He also hosted “On the Record with Bob Costas” and “Costas Now” for HBO between 2001 and 2008, and recently returned to the premium cable channel with “Back on the Record with Bob Costas.” The program’s first episode featured long-form conversations with renowned sports figures including Charles Barkley and Aly Raisman and it tackles controversial topics in athletics, including: the pressure on Simone Biles to perform; the Supreme Court’s recent ruling on NCAA athletes’ capitalizing on their own names, images and likeness; and the International Olympic Committee’s “troubling affinity for authoritarian regimes.”<br />After his tapings in New York, however, Mr. Costas might be more likely to order a car service or wave down a cab than to rely on tech for a ride home since he’s yet to embrace Uber. “I cheerfully admit my shortcomings,” he said. “That’s actually one of my virtues. I never pretend to know more than I do or pretend to be able to do stuff I can’t.”<br />Here Mr. Costas explains his apprehension about adapting to new tech, how easily he can pass off his 2007 Lexus for a 2021 model, and why he never leaves home without a certain baseball card.</td>

      <td>The eight-CD/12-LP collection from Blue Note reveals the artistic growth and evolving musical ideas of the gifted trumpeter, who died at age 33.</td>
      <td>Trumpeter Lee Morgan’s life in music has been overshadowed by the circumstances of his death—at age 33, in 1972, after his common-law wife shot him outside a downtown Manhattan jazz club. But Morgan was still a teenager when jazz giants Dizzy Gillespie and Art Blakey recruited him to join their bands, and he later played in the great 1959-61 edition of Blakey’s Jazz Messengers. He had a hit, “The Sidewinder,” that made the pop charts in 1964, and it was used as theme music for television shows and commercials. In addition, he fought for the inclusion of jazz musicians in TV talk-show bands and for recognition of the genre in academic curricula.<br />Yet tribute recordings devoted to Morgan are few and far between, and Kasper Collin’s 2016 film, “I Called Him Morgan,” dwelt as much on his killer as it did on the trumpeter. This long neglect may now change with the release of “The Complete Live at The Lighthouse” (Blue Note), an eight-CD/12-LP collection of the music from Morgan’s only official live recording. Drawn from 12 sets of music performed in July 1970 at a storied Hermosa Beach, Calif., club with one of Morgan’s last working bands, the concerts were originally issued as a two-LP set in 1971 and then as three CDs in 1996. The new collection features more than four hours of previously unreleased music and showcases Morgan’s evolving sound and the band’s solidifying chemistry.<br />A Morgan solo always made you sit up and take notice. Dramatic, dynamic and ambitious, his tone was big and brash on finger-popping, uptempo numbers, yet warm and tender on ballads. Trumpeter and composer Dave Douglas wrote to me in an email about Morgan, “Horace Silver pointed out to me the supreme hipness of Lee Morgan’s voice, not what he plays over one chord, but how he gets from one to the next.” Morgan was always willing to take risks, bending notes and adding variations to the themes. There was an urgency to his music.<br />In the years following “The Sidewinder,” Morgan continued to make stellar recordings, most built either on the cool grooves of “The Sidewinder” or on the Blakey sound. But one album, “Search for the New Land” (Blue Note, 1966), showed another side emerging. It presented extended compositions and a probing, introspective side of the trumpeter. On the “Lighthouse” sides, Morgan mixes all three of these styles effectively. His band—which included reedman Bennie Maupin, pianist Harold Mabern, bassist Jymie Merritt and drummer Mickey Roker—played nightly sets at the venue for a week and a half before the recording began, so the musicians had an unusually high level of rapport with each other and a comfort with the acoustics of the venue. (Even weeklong engagements are now considered long.)<br />The rendition of “The Sidewinder” on “The Complete Live at The Lighthouse” sounds more exuberant than obligatory, and it feels like a gleeful nod to the ’60s, while much of the other material points to the future. Led by Roker’s frenetic drumming, Mabern’s “The Beehive” roars with intensity and gusto, and it bridges the gap between the hard bop of the ’60s and the longer solos and more open structures that were a trademark of some ’70s jazz. Mr. Maupin’s contributions to the repertoire, especially “416 East 10th Street” and “Neophilia,” also present a wide-open sound. There are three versions of the latter composition, one from each of the three nights of the recording, and the solos grow in intensity. Merritt’s “Nommo” would soon become a signature for the Max Roach Quartet, a band that typified the ’70s post-bop style, and his “Absolutions,” a rarity, spotlights the band’s tight interplay. Morgan’s brief career was slowed by addiction, and he didn’t shy away from his past. The band used his composition “Speedball,” which is also a blend of heroin and cocaine, as an outro theme, but one of the highlights of the box is a full-length rendition featuring drummer Jack DeJohnette. His playing is looser than Roker’s and it pushes the band in many directions.</td>

The fire has destroyed nearly 579,000 acres in Butte, Plumas, Lassen and Tehama counties, making it the second-largest fire in California history. Earlier this month, the large fire burned much of the town of Greenville, about 115 miles northeast of Sacramento.<br />The fire may have started when a tree touched one of PG&E’s power lines, the company disclosed to regulators last month. A total of 6,579 fire personnel are assigned to the blaze, which is 31% contained, according to InciWeb, which shares fire reports from different government agencies. The fire is burning northeast of Paradise, which was destroyed in 2018 by a fire sparked by a PG&E transmission line. That wildfire, the deadliest in California history, killed 84 people.</td>

      <td>Those who dismiss risk of climate change often appeal to uncertainty, but they have it backward.</td>
      <td>In “Climate Change Brings a Flood of Hyperbole” (op-ed, Aug. 11), Steven Koonin put himself in the unenviable position of playing down climate change precisely while we are experiencing unprecedented heat waves, storms, fires, droughts, and floods that exceed model-based expectations.<br />Mr. Koonin claims that regional projections are “meant to scare people.” But the paper he cites for support addresses the “unfolding of what may become catastrophic changes to Earth’s climate” and argues that “being able to anticipate what would otherwise be surprises in extreme weather and climate variations” requires better models. In other words, our current models cannot rule out a catastrophic future.<br />Model uncertainty is two-edged. If we’d been lucky, we’d be discovering that we overestimated the danger. But all indicators suggest the opposite. Those who dismiss climate risk often appeal to uncertainty, but they have it backward. Climate uncertainty is like not knowing how many shots Dirty Harry fired from his .44-caliber Magnum. Now that it’s pointed at our head, it’s dawning on us that we’ve probably miscalculated. By the time we’re sure, it’s too late. We’ve got to ask ourselves one question: Do we feel lucky? Well, do we?<br />Adj. Prof. Mark Boslough<br />University of New Mexico</td>

      <td>The risk from the virus is real and documented.</td>
      <td>In “De Blasio Banishes My Kids From New York” (op-ed, Aug. 10), Ray Prisament acts as if the jury is out regarding the safety of the vaccine for teens. This is far from the truth. Hundreds of thousands of teens have been part of a vaccine trial, and other than a very rare condition called myocarditis, which is usually mild and resolves quickly, little risk has been found. The risk from Covid, however, is real and documented: Some kids get very sick and have long-lasting complications. As of Thursday, 1,785 children were hospitalized across the country. Although there is a risk with any vaccine, the risk of not getting the vaccine is far greater.<br />Cathy Putnam<br />Concord, Mass.<br /><br />Mr. Prisament asks if it matters that, statistically, young people denied access to a New York City diner due to vaccination protocols might be more likely to be black. The answer is no, it matters not a whit which racial or ethnic group listed on the census questionnaire a person belongs to. It is a public-health measure, designed to minimize contact between those who are at the highest risk of being spreaders of the disease and those who are not. Unfortunately, Mr. Prisament’s children currently fall into the former category, and that is the only reason the diner would refuse them entry. It is very reasonable consequence of a choice made by him on their behalf—no more, no less.</td>

      <td>There are many options between nation building and giving up, and we had found a good one in Afghanistan before President Biden abandoned it.</td>
      <td>Almost everyone agrees that what’s happening in Afghanistan is an unmitigated disaster. There is no way to whitewash it, and few are trying. The scenes from Kabul speak for themselves, casting shame and embarrassment on the world’s greatest superpower. There is plenty of blame being passed around, including to the “neocons,” the generals and the Afghans themselves. But what got us here was the widespread belief that American foreign policy should be dictated by a simple slogan: “No more endless wars.” The current spokesman for that belief is President Biden.<br />The argument for bringing the troops home is an emotional one, arising from exhaustion with overseas conflict. Most people don’t understand the situation in Afghanistan, and that causes distrust and anger. Few deny we needed to take action after 9/11, but few understood what our strategy would be after we got there. Leaders failed to explain that simply leaving would allow the Taliban to re-emerge and again provide safe haven for terrorists. Americans felt stuck and became exhausted over the years with the vast sums of money spent and lives lost, seemingly in a futile attempt to build democracy.<br />With this growing impatience, the case for cutting our losses grew stronger. But it fails to acknowledge trade-offs—and this simple question: If we evacuate Afghanistan, what will happen? The “no more endless wars” crowd always refused to answer. They prefer to live in a dream world rather than face the reality that our enemies are ideologically opposed to Western civilization and will gladly stage another 9/11 if they have the opportunity and means. They are at war with us whether or not we are at war with them. Leaving Afghanistan would inevitably create a terrorist safe haven.<br />That simple reality was never properly explained to the public. When Quinnipiac asked in a May survey, “Should we leave Afghanistan?” 62% of respondents said yes. But what if the question was framed more completely: “Should we leave Afghanistan even if it means an increased threat of terrorism to the homeland?”<br />The “no more endless wars” position has another blind spot: Its advocates are unable to distinguish between wasteful nation building and a small residual force that conducts occasional counterterror operations. As a result, when many Americans hear that there is a single soldier on the ground in Afghanistan, they interpret it to mean “nation building” and “world police.”</td>

      <td>The president will have to persuade progressives to save his infrastructure bill.</td>
      <td>In a speech reflecting on the 40th year of her reign, Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II labeled 1992—a year that included the separation or divorce of three of her children and a deluge of embarrassing publicity—an annus horribilis.<br />August is proving to be a mensis horribilis for the Biden administration. The pandemic, which seemed to be waning at the beginning of July, has resurged among the unvaccinated, overwhelming healthcare systems in hot spots and triggering more rancorous debates about masks and vaccine mandates. Inflation—an increasing concern for the public—is running higher than economists expected. The rapid collapse of the Afghan government and Taliban takeover of the country contradicted the assurances President Biden had given only a month ago. The sight of desperate Afghans surging onto the tarmac at Kabul’s airport summoned uncomfortable memories of Saigon in 1975.<br />Even before pictures of Taliban fighters in the presidential palace that Ashraf Ghani ignominiously fled flashed around the world, Mr. Biden’s job approval had fallen by 5 percentage points since late May. Despite the president’s forceful defense of his decision to withdraw in an address to the nation on Monday, this fiasco is unlikely to arrest the decline in his public standing.<br />Mr. Biden needs a win—soon. But Congress isn’t poised to deliver one, as House Democrats feud among themselves. The Senate passed both the bipartisan infrastructure bill and a $3.5 trillion budget resolution that would kick off the process known as reconciliation. Speaker Nancy Pelosi had expected to pass the budget resolution in the House and turn to the reconciliation bill, which will feature measures progressive Democrats fervently support, including green energy and child-care spending. Fulfilling her pledge to this part of her caucus, she planned not to vote on the infrastructure bill until the Senate passed the bill of progressive priorities.<br />Enter nine moderate House Democrats who sent the speaker a letter last week demanding a prompt vote on the infrastructure bill and threatening to withhold their support for the budget resolution until they receive such a roll call. This revolt took courage; much of Congress’s power is concentrated in leadership at the expense of committees and individual members.</td>

How can I live with all the uncertainty?<br />To answer these questions, people often turn to spirituality. And a body of scientific research suggests that spiritual thinking provides some concrete benefits to our mental well-being and outlook.<br />Lisa Miller is a clinical psychologist and director of the Spirituality Mind Body Institute at Teachers College, Columbia University, a graduate program and research center, where she studies the intersection of spirituality and mental wellness.<br />She teaches clinical psychology and has worked with corporations, schools, faith-based organizations, homeless shelters and the U.S. military to help individuals use spirituality to improve their mental health. Her new book is “The Awakened Brain: The New Science of Spirituality and Our Quest for an Inspired Life.”<br />Dr. Miller conducts brain scans of people as they’re thinking spiritual thoughts and analyzes large mental-health studies. Her research has found that spirituality helps protect us from depression and helps us become more resilient and make better decisions. Studies also show that these benefits typically occur regardless of what religion we are—or whether we’re religious at all.</td>

      <td>Ford Motor Co.  wants to put you into a new car—in six to eight weeks.<br />In a shift in the way it sells vehicles, Ford plans to do a bigger portion of its sales by having buyers order from the factory and wait, rather than pick from the selection available at the dealership.<br />Company executives say efforts to shift more of Ford’s auto retailing operations to a so-called build-to-order model, where people custom-order online and take delivery at the dealership, would help cut inventory costs for the company and its dealers. It would also help Ford to deliver more vehicles that customers specifically want, while weeding out the hard-to-sell models that end up collecting dust at dealerships and lead to profit-sapping discounts, they say.<br />The approach, which was outlined to Wall Street in July and is being implemented now, is a departure from the way vehicles have been sold by car companies and dealers in the U.S. While dealers and analysts see potential benefits, they also flag risks, notably the prospect of losing market share if shoppers who aren’t willing to wait simply go elsewhere.<br />“Customers like immediate satisfaction,” said Don Johnson, who ran  General Motors Co. ’s U.S. sales operation early last decade and now advises auto companies on their retail strategies.</td>

Now, he is getting a bigger war chest and a clear mandate to go on another shopping spree.<br />J2 Global—which owns a collection of assets including tech site Mashable, fax provider eFax and the videogame brand IGN—said earlier this year it is splitting into two companies. The bigger business, run by Mr. Shah, will get all of the media assets plus a $1 billion infusion to buy more. The spinoff business, called Consensus, will keep the slower-growing eFax.<br />In an interview, Mr. Shah said that the parent company will be renamed Ziff Davis, a nod to the century-old publisher. Mr. Shah said he picked the name—which calls to mind the heyday of the dot-com boom—because that publishing company survived an industry shake-up from print to digital and weathered a 2008 bankruptcy. Among Ziff Davis’s best known properties is PC Magazine, which chronicled the personal-computing revolution.<br />Mr. Shah, a former Time Inc. executive, led a private-equity buyout of the original Ziff Davis in 2010, purchasing the publisher for less than $25 million. He helped sell the company in 2012 to j2 Global for $167 million and was appointed CEO of the parent company in 2018. Earlier this year, Mr. Shah announced the spin off, which he said will simplify the business for investors. He owns less than 2% of the company.<br />“At its darkest moment, right after the great recession, we were able to recover,” Mr. Shah said. “Not many things live 100 years.”</td>

U.S. e-commerce sales rose 6% from a year ago, when Covid restrictions kept many people home.<br />Growth slowed from earlier in the year, both online and off, but was still given a boost by government stimulus dollars and a generally strong U.S. economy, the company said Tuesday. Sales increased each month through the quarter, with July the strongest month, Walmart said.<br />The latest quarterly sales and profits exceeded Wall Street’s estimates. For its fiscal year, Walmart forecast continued sales gains. For the U.S. comparable sales will rise 5% to 6% for the year, Walmart said.<br />More shoppers came to Walmart stores, with U.S. transactions up 6.1% during the quarter, but they spent slightly less per visit, or around 0.8% less versus the same period last year. That’s a flip from earlier pandemic trends when shoppers moved spending online and visited stores less frequently, but spent more each visit.</td>

But unlike European governments, which themselves face more public pressure over data collection, Beijing is expected to maintain broad access to data under the new Personal Information Protection Law.<br />The national privacy law, China’s first, is being reviewed as frustration grows within the government, and in Chinese society at large, over online fraud, data theft and data collection by Chinese technology giants. The law is on its third round of reviews, usually the last before passage.<br />The law will require any organization or individual handling Chinese citizens’ personal data to minimize data collection and to obtain prior consent, according to the latest published draft. It covers government agencies, though lawyers and policy analysts say enforcement is likely to be tighter on the private sector.<br />While privacy in Europe and the U.S. is generally understood to mean protection from both private companies and the government, in China the government has aligned itself with consumers to fight data theft and privacy infringement, says Kendra Schaefer, a partner at Beijing-based consulting firm Trivium China.</td>

Investors might be getting this story right, but for the wrong reasons.<br />Both Uber and Lyft have been investing heavily in incentives to grow their driver supply to handle upticks in demand, but second-quarter results show Uber might have taken a more aggressive approach. Lyft said it significantly increased investments to boost its driver base in the quarter.

DoorDash  said the second quarter brought more first-time drivers to its platform than any previous quarter, noting that over three million people “dashed” in the period. That comes despite the fact that ride-hailers have historically made more than food-delivery drivers and recently have been banking record pay in many areas.<br />A July survey of over 4,000 U.S. DoorDash drivers conducted by Quadrant Strategies and referred to in DoorDash’s shareholder letter was illuminating. While ride-hailers have said stimulus checks are likely to have weighed on driver supply, the survey found more than half of DoorDash’s drivers have been driving to avoid applying for government benefits. That could indicate that food delivery is more flexible or accessible than ride hailing for drivers seeking extra cash. It also might mean the end of stimulus checks will bring fewer drivers back to ride-hailing platforms than those companies have hoped.<br />Not all gig-economy work is equally appealing to all drivers. Some of it might never be. According to the survey, 96% of DoorDash’s drivers don’t currently drive with ride-share platforms, while 82% said they have never done so and don’t plan to. Most cited safety as a concern—one unlikely to abate as the Delta variant continues to spread. Nearly three-quarters of those drivers said they didn’t want to share their vehicle, a staple of ride-hailing that won’t ever go away.</td>

      <td>WSJ analysis finds higher risk of infection from strain, but research shows that vaccines still protect against most serious illness</td>
      <td>The Delta variant of the Covid-19 virus appears to be breaking through the protection vaccines provide at a higher rate than previous strains, a Wall Street Journal analysis found, though infections among the fully inoculated remain a tiny fraction of overall cases, and symptoms tend to be milder.<br />U.S. states counted at least 193,204 so-called breakthrough cases among vaccinated people between Jan. 1 and early August, according to data that health departments in 44 states and Washington, D.C., provided to the Journal. The figure represents 0.1% of the more than 136 million fully vaccinated people in those states and the capital.<br />The total number of breakthrough cases is likely higher, public-health experts said, because fully vaccinated people with asymptomatic infections likely aren’t getting tested for Covid-19. Additionally, several states said the data were unavailable, while others track only breakthrough cases that result in hospitalizations or death.<br />Of the 44 health departments that responded to the Journal’s requests, 28 of them also broke down the number of cases they had tracked since the start of July, when the Delta variant emerged as the dominant strain of the virus.<br />At least 11 states including California and Mississippi counted more than half of their reported breakthrough cases between July 1 and early August, suggesting that the rise of Delta was causing more breakthroughs than earlier strains. In at least six states including Maryland and Minnesota, more than a third of breakthrough cases were reported during that period.</td>

      <td>Stock has doubled since last year’s camera boosted subscribers, setting high stakes for the next one</td>
      <td>GoPro  has managed to upsell its way out of the pandemic. Now the action camera maker has to make extra sure it can hit its marks, which has never been a sure thing.<br />Missteps on past camera launches and the company’s first-and-only attempt at a drone hobbled the stock in the years following its 2014 listing. From the beginning of 2018 to last fall, GoPro averaged a market value about 30% below its projected annual revenue, according to FactSet. A global pandemic that curtailed the very sort of adventurous outings people buy GoPro cameras to document didn’t help either. The company’s camera unit sales in the first half of 2020 were less than half their level during the same period the year before.<br />Launch of the latest camera called Hero9 Black last September helped revive both sales and investor sentiment. Camera unit sales nearly doubled year over year in the launch quarter and have stayed strong. That also sparked growth of the company’s service that bundles the camera with cloud-based storage, access to a branded streaming channel, enhanced warranty coverage and discounts on other gear. GoPro said in early October that the new Hero9 propelled paid subscribers past the 500,000 mark compared with 372,000 at the end of the second quarter. That number now stands at 1.16 million as of the end of this year’s second quarter.<br />Apple Inc.  has handily proved the benefit a services business can bring to a cyclical maker of premium gadgets; services now make up nearly 20% of the iPhone maker’s annual revenue. Investors have therefore taken a particular shine to GoPro’s subscriber numbers. Trading volume on the stock started jumping the day after the aforementioned Oct. 6 news release—which didn’t detail camera sales volumes. Part of the interest seems to have come from the WallStreetBets crowd; TopStonks noted a sharp rise in GoPro mentions on the board at that time. GoPro shares hit their highest level in five years in March and are still fetching more than double their price since before the subscriber disclosure.<br />That sets a high bar coming into the company’s next launch cycle. GoPro typically reveals at least one new camera in the fall, and this year’s will presumably be the 10th iteration of its high-definition Hero lineup. GoPro’s business has shown resilience to vastly-improving smartphone camera capabilities as well as much-less expensive copycats. Yet, while the company says 80% of its camera buyers each year are new to GoPro, its annual camera unit sales were relatively unchanged around the 4.3 million mark in the three years before the pandemic.</td>

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  fell 4.8% and  Tencent Holdings Ltd.  more than 4%, while short-video specialist Kuaishou Technology, video and gaming group  Bilibili Inc.,  and search giant  Baidu Inc.  fell to record lows. The Hang Seng Tech index in Hong Kong, which includes Tencent and Alibaba stocks, has declined some 40% in the past six months.<br />The market regulator said the new guidelines targeting internet companies were intended to clarify an existing law on unfair competition. China also finalized new antimonopoly rules for online platforms this year.</td>

You’re invited to play along with us here.<br />Drug development is among the most lucrative segments of U.S. industry, and perhaps the single most risky. With  Royalty Pharma ,  investors looking for a middle ground can find their Prince Charming.<br />The upside of a given biotech investment is readily apparent. Covid-19 vaccine developers like  Moderna Inc.,   Pfizer Inc.  and  BioNTech SE  expect to book more than $50 billion in combined revenue this year at fat profit margins, resulting in huge gains for some investors.<br />Yet the sector is often too volatile and dangerous for the average individual investor. The reality is that drug development is expensive and difficult. The majority of drug candidates fail to reach the market, and spending hundreds of millions of dollars developing a product that generates zero sales is hardly uncommon.<br />Enter Royalty Pharma. The company, which was founded in 1996 and went public in June last year, helps fund expensive clinical trials for a promising new drug in a typical transaction. In exchange, the drugmaker sends Royalty a predetermined slice of that drug’s revenue in the years after it reaches the market. The company owns rights to drugs sold by the likes of  Johnson & Johnson ,   AbbVie ,  Pfizer,  Gilead Sciences  and  Vertex Pharmaceuticals .</td>

Oxford also has made big investments in cold-storage facilities and U.S. regional distribution centers as large as one million square feet.<br />The KKR deal is Oxford’s first purchase of U.S. industrial real estate in “infill” locations close to population centers. These properties typically are used by online retailers as the last distribution points before goods are delivered to homes.<br />“It all comes down to being close to the population,” said Ankit Bhatt, vice president at Oxford.<br />Industrial property was one of the hottest commercial-property types in the years leading up to the pandemic, thanks to the growing appeal of online shopping. Demand has only intensified since Covid-19 hit, keeping consumers away from stores. Currently about 15% of shopping is done online, compared with 10% in 2018, according to market participants.</td>

Military flights resumed as the U.S. sent additional troops to secure the airport, but access remained difficult as the Taliban erected checkpoints at the entrances, turning people away. Some evacuation flights were leaving near-empty as a result.<br />Taliban agents continued searching the offices and homes of Afghans affiliated with Western governments and organizations, collecting evidence. At the new checkpoints that sprang up in the city, they inspected residents’ smartphones for illicit contents—and for communications in English.<br />In Kabul, the Taliban, who proclaimed the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan when they first seized the country in 1996, have so far refrained from the kind of radical actions that brought world-wide condemnation in the past. They issued an amnesty to government officials and on Tuesday allowed female presenters on television channels.<br />The only known execution since the capital’s Sunday takeover was of Abu Omar Khorasani, the former head of Islamic State in South Asia, who was taken by the Taliban from an Afghan government prison and killed on the spot, according to officials. A photo of his body was later posted on social media.</td>

Genetic sequencing that would confirm or disprove that assumption will be available Wednesday.<br />“Going hard and early has worked for us before,” Ms. Ardern told a press conference. “While we know that Delta is a more dangerous enemy to combat, the same actions that overcame the virus last year can be applied to beat it again.”<br />The seven-day lockdown for Auckland will close schools and most businesses and also be imposed on another region, Coromandel, that the infected person, a 58-year-old Auckland man, traveled to. All other parts of the country will be required to lock down for three days.<br />New Zealand has had just over 2,500 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and few deaths, according to data from its health ministry. The country has been helped by a strict initial lockdown last year and its remote island geography. Its borders have been closed to virtually all travelers, except those such as citizens and long-term residents, since March 2020.</td>

As part of a five-year mass fitness program announced this month, the government said it would build more fitness facilities and encourage people to exercise. Beijing aims to grow the sports industry to 5 trillion yuan, the equivalent of $772 billion, in 2025, which would be a 70% rise from 2019 levels. And at a time when regulatory concerns are clouding the outlook for many other sectors, in particular the internet industry, sportswear stocks look like a haven.<br />The backlash against foreign brands over their stance on the use of forced labor in China’s Xinjiang region earlier this year has also provided a lift to their Chinese competitors.  Nike  and  Adidas  are China’s top two sportswear brands, accounting for 43% of the market in 2020, according to Euromonitor International.<br />But the rise of Chinese brands also predates the recent tensions. Anta’s market share, for example, has risen from 11% in 2017 to 15% in 2020, according to Euromonitor. Li Ning’s operating profit has been growing every year since 2015, when it emerged from three years of losses.

      <td>As vaccinations in the U.S. have slowed significantly from their peak, they have risen sharply in Latin America, with a host of countries now inoculating against Covid-19 at a far higher rate than their richer neighbor to the north.<br />The progress in Latin America is built on two factors that have gotten little attention: In many countries, people are eager to get vaccinated and largely trust vaccines, more so than in many richer countries, including the U.S.<br />At the same time, vaccine supply problems are being slowly overcome. Far greater numbers of vaccines are now arriving from the U.S., U.K., Russia and China, allowing local health officials to pick up the pace.<br />“Latin America has always been a champion for vaccination and people trust vaccines,” said Patricia García, a former Peruvian health minister and epidemiologist. “If we are able to get enough supply of the vaccines, we can catch up.”<br />Roughly two-thirds of people in Chile and Uruguay are fully vaccinated, compared with about half in the U.S. Most of the rest of Latin America is still behind the U.S. in the share of people with one or both vaccine doses, but a number of countries are closing the gap fast.</td>

The fabric, which was two years in the making, is Allbirds’ latest attempt to rethink the apparel industry’s longstanding reliance on polyester and other synthetic fibers.<br />Allbirds’ effort to get people to wear wool shoes was a resounding success, as its sneakers quickly became a favorite in Silicon Valley. It now has to sell consumers on the merits of working up a sweat in leggings made of similar materials, while competing in a sector dominated by  Lululemon  Athletica Inc.,  Nike Inc.  and other companies that tout lightweight, moisture-wicking gear.<br />Allbirds executives say wool is naturally suited for exercise. It can absorb up to 30% of its weight in moisture, while also regulating temperature, according to Tim Brown, Allbirds co-chief executive.<br />Polyester, which is a type of plastic that is usually derived from petroleum, is one of the most widely used fibers in the world, according to the Council of Fashion Designers of America. But synthetic fabrics like polyester shed plastic particles that are finding their way into the oceans.</td>

      <td>One of the largest U.S. hotel owners is experimenting this year with a new business strategy: Charge guests for most services and amenities, just like in the airline industry.<br />At roughly a dozen of his company’s independent hotels, Tyler Morse said, any guest can get an early check-in, but it costs about $20. A similar fee applies to a late checkout. Use of the pool might be free on a Tuesday morning, but cost guests $25 on a scorching Saturday afternoon. Gym use and breakfast also come with an additional charge.<br />In exchange, these properties are lowering their nightly room rates by varying degrees, Mr. Morse said. His hotels trying out the pricing model include the TWA Hotel at John F. Kennedy International Airport and the High Line Hotel in Manhattan, he added.<br />Mr. Morse, chief executive of MCR Hotels, said a rocky transition period could occur before most hotel guests adjust to the idea of paying only for the services and perks they want. But he said the a la carte pricing approach is likely to be a hit over time.<br />“Not every guest wants every product, and they don’t want to pay for something they were never going to use anyway,” he said. “Other owners are fully behind me, but there’s always a fear of change.”</td>

      <td>Economists estimate sales excluding autos rose during a month when concerns about the Delta variant intensified</td>
      <td>Spending at U.S. retailers likely fell in July, amid cooling auto purchases and signs of some pullback in consumer demand as Covid-19 cases tied to the Delta variant rose, economists say.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimate the Commerce Department will report Tuesday that retail sales—a measure of purchases at stores, at restaurants and online—fell by 0.3% last month compared with June. Excluding autos—a category where supply-chain issues have limited available inventory—sales are estimated to have risen by 0.2%.<br />Retail sales rose briskly in June, as shoppers directed spending toward services, such as dining out and traveling, and away from goods. That shift occurred as more Americans became vaccinated and state and local governments eliminated many Covid-19-related restrictions, some of which have now been reimposed with the recent rise in coronavirus cases.<br />Pooja Sriram, U.S. economist at Barclays, said she expects increased services spending to continue, but that consumer spending will grow more slowly than earlier this year as the boost from federal aid to households wanes. U.S. consumer spending rose at a robust 11.8% annual rate in the second quarter, contributing strongly to economic growth during the period.<br />Retailers and other U.S. businesses are also facing uncertainty caused by the Delta variant, as the highly transmissible strain causes setbacks for some companies and data suggest some pullback in spending on items such as air travel and cruises. A University of Michigan survey showed a sharp drop in consumer sentiment during early August. Richard Curtin, the survey’s chief economist, said the decline was due "mainly from dashed hopes that the pandemic would soon end.”</td>

The longstanding intelligence assessment had been 18 months to two years after an American military withdrawal, current and former U.S. officials said.<br />The U.S. invaded Afghanistan in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks conducted by al Qaeda, a counterterrorism mission that President Biden said was completed long ago.<br />But jihadist groups saw the stunningly rapid sweep to power of the Taliban—which harbored al Qaeda before 2001 and hasn’t publicly broken with it—as validating their strategy of patience, analysts who follow their online postings said.<br />“This is without a doubt the most significant day for al Qaeda since 9/11,” Charles Lister, of the nonpartisan Middle East Institute, wrote in a post on Medium.com, saying the extremist group was in dire straits just weeks ago. “For the first time in years, not only does al Qaeda finally have some breathing space, it’s being gifted an enormously significant safe haven in which to rebuild.”</td>

      <td>Biden is defiant in blaming others for his Afghan debacle.</td>
      <td>President Biden told the world on Monday that he doesn’t regret his decision to withdraw rapidly from Afghanistan, or even the chaotic, incompetent way the withdrawal has been executed. He is determined in retreat, defiant in surrender, and confident in the rightness of consigning the country to jihadist rule. We doubt the world will see it the same way in the days, months and years ahead.<br />Mr. Biden refused to accept responsibility for the botched withdrawal while blaming others. He blamed Donald Trump’s peace deal with the Taliban and falsely claimed again that he was trapped. He blamed his three predecessors for not getting out of Afghanistan. He blamed the Afghans for not fighting hard enough, their leaders for fleeing, and even Afghans who helped us for not leaving sooner. The one group he conspicuously did not blame was the Taliban, who once harbored Osama bin Laden and may protect his terrorist successor.<br />The President made glancing reference to the horrible scenes unfolding in Kabul and especially at the airport, though again without addressing the mistakes that led to them. Had the U.S. not given up the air base at Bagram, now controlled by the Taliban, the U.S. would not now have to fight to control Kabul’s commercial airfield.<br />The chaotic scenes at the airport, with Afghans hanging from a U.S. military plane and two falling from the sky to their deaths, will be the indelible images of this debacle. They are the echo of 9/11, with people falling from the sky, that Mr. Biden didn’t anticipate when he chose the 20th anniversary of 9/11 as his withdrawal deadline.<br />Instead of taking responsibility, Mr. Biden played to the sentiment of Americans who are tired of foreign military missions. It’s a powerful point to speak of sending a child to risk his life in a foreign country, and no doubt it will resonate with many Americans. It is a question that every President should ask.</td>

      <td>The Taliban’s protector cheers the group’s Afghanistan takeover.</td>
      <td>American strategists will be studying for some time how Afghanistan’s U.S.-trained security forces crumbled so quickly before what appeared to be an inferior Taliban militia. One place they should look for answers is Pakistan, whose leader on Monday cheered the Taliban takeover of its northwestern neighbor.<br />Afghans “have broken the shackles of slavery,” said Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, according to Indian media. The offhand celebration of the U.S. retreat from Afghanistan came as Mr. Khan denounced English education in Pakistan as promoting cultural control.<br />That a U.S. security partner would say this out loud certainly raises eyebrows. But the sentiment should not surprise. As Walter Russell Meadnotes nearby, a key obstacle to American success in Afghanistan was “unrelenting support for the Taliban from our ‘ally’ in Islamabad.” The Taliban safe-haven across Afghanistan’s southern border was crucial to the group’s longevity and eventual military success.<br />Over the last two decades, the U.S. depended on bases in Pakistan for its war-on-terror operations in Central Asia. Yet Islamabad is playing its own great-power games in the region. Its intelligence services want control over Afghanistan and have seen the Taliban as the best vehicle. They want to frustrate the objectives of their greatest regional rival, India, which would prefer a secular government in Kabul.<br />The U.S. relationship with Islamist-influenced Pakistan has arguably become a devil’s bargain. Americans caught a glimpse of that a decade ago when they found out Osama Bin Laden was hiding in the country, apparently unmolested. Now Islamabad has played a key role in restoring to power the Taliban that the U.S. sacrificed for two decades to keep from power in Kabul.</td>

      <td>Bad policies cause a shortage that is hurting Newsom in the recall.</td>
      <td>Ballooning housing costs have become a focal point in California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s recall election and are one reason the state last year lost population for the first time. Blame policies that limit new housing.<br />The Census Bureau last Thursday released state and county-level data on the growth in housing over the last decade. Housing development surged across the Sun Belt, including Utah (17.5%), Texas (16.2%), Idaho (12.6%), Florida (9.7%), Nevada (9.1%) and Arizona (8.3%). Then there’s California (5.2%), where housing supply has failed to keep up with demand for decades, driving prices higher and higher.<br />Los Angeles County added 4.3% new housing units versus 19.8% in Bexar County (San Antonio). The median home price in LA is $898,692 versus $226,665 in San Antonio. No wonder so many middle-income families are fleeing the Golden State.<br />Local zoning restrictions make it hard to convert vacant commercial real estate into housing. The state’s Environmental Quality Act results in endless litigation, delays and increased construction costs. The Los Angeles Times reported last year that it cost $531,000 on average to build a single unit of housing for a homeless person.<br />The cost for one homeless housing project soared to $746,000 per unit after a neighboring shopping complex sued. The developer settled by agreeing to add various design features and an underground parking lot, but the litigation took four years. Now LA is setting up 8-by-8-foot sheds—the type you can buy for a couple of thousand dollars—for the homeless at a cost of $130,000 apiece.</td>

      <td>Tehran’s proxies unleash violence on several fronts in the Mideast as it senses weakness in adversaries.</td>
      <td>The Taliban’s seizure of power in Afghanistan, while swift and dramatic, is neither the first nor the sole challenge to the U.S. and its allies taking place in and around the region. Iran is mounting another, no less significant push. Behind both offensives is the perception that the regional order is failing and the U.S. is retreating.<br />The factor underlying the Mideast violence earlier this summer seems clear: Iran is trying to assert power across several fronts. It is wielding a variety of assets, proxies and franchises against the full range of enemies it perceives in the region.<br />Part of the escalation was last month’s fatal drone attack on the merchant vessel Mercer Street in the Gulf of Oman. The Liberian-flagged oil tanker belongs to Zodiac Maritime, a London-based firm owned by Israeli shipping magnate Eyal Ofer. Two people were killed: a British crewman and the Romanian captain. Responsibility for the attack “clearly points to Iran,” according to a Group of Seven statement Aug. 6. Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh called the accusation “baseless.”<br />Lebanese Hezbollah’s launch of 20 Katyusha missiles at Israel on Aug. 6 represents a sharp breach of the de facto rules that have largely held along the border since the end of the Second Lebanon War 15 years ago. The launch itself and the claim of responsibility by Hezbollah—Iran’s proxy—reflect an apparent willingness on the part of the Lebanese Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps franchise to provoke Israel.<br />Iran’s IRGC-trained death squads have been busy in remote areas seldom covered by Western media. On July 14, Iranian dissident, activist and environmentalist Behrouz Rahimi was killed in Suleimania, an Iraqi city near the border with Iran. Closed-circuit television footage shows a  BMW  with tinted windows and no license plate tailing Mr. Rahimi. Gunmen then opened fire from the car. Mr. Rahimi died from his wounds in the hospital. His wife later cited recent threats against her husband from Iran’s Intelligence Ministry. Iran hasn’t made a statement on the killing.</td>

      <td>‘You hear on the news every day that you’re not wanted,’ sprinter Noah Lyles told a journalist.</td>
      <td>Now that the Olympics in Tokyo are over, everyone is talking about its great, unforgettable moments. I watched my fair share of this year’s Olympic Games, and rather doubt I shall remember much about them, apart from one indelible moment. It took place not on any court or field, mat or ring, but in an interview on NBC between Lester Holt and a 24-year-old American Olympian sprinter named Noah Lyles, who won a bronze medal in the 200-meter race.<br />In the interview, Mr. Holt informs us that as a kid Mr. Lyles had asthma, attention-deficit disorder and dyslexia, but surmounted them all, as well as the teasing that went with them, to achieve his dream of competing in the Olympics. Mr. Lyles reports, though, that the past year has been tough on him, sending him into depression. Mr. Holt asked about this depression, which Mr. Lyles acknowledged began during the past year when, as he said, “the Black Lives Matter movement started gaining a lot of traction. That’s when the depression took over. You hear on the news every day that you’re not wanted. You love your country, but it hurts even more to see that the country they want you to support is trying to kill you.”<br />That sad moment caused a wave of depression of my own. Interesting, is it not, that this is how the Black Lives Matter movement translates itself into the mind of a sensitive, athletically successful, and likable young man such as Mr. Lyles? Is Mr. Lyles misreading the BLM message? Do Americans really “not want” Mr. Lyles and his confreres in the country? How has it come about that he came to believe such bilge?<br />I pretend to no great expertise on the Black Lives Matter movement. I have not examined all the documents it has produced, nor heard every utterance of its leading figures. From the utterances I have heard, I gather that BLM is antipolice, crudely anti-Israel and not overly critical of the cruel looting that has accompanied many of its ostensibly peaceful protests. The organization does not feature the extraordinary progress that has been made in race relations or the progress of black Americans in recent decades.<br />One cannot mistake the anger in the utterances of BLM, so different from the thoughtful and measured statements of civil-rights leaders of an earlier day: A. Philip Randolph, Roy Wilkins Sr., Martin Luther King Jr., Whitney Young, Bayard Rustin—men who were on the front lines when it was truly dangerous to be there.</td>

      <td>As in Vietnam, the priority should be rescuing as many allies as possible.</td>
      <td>When an ocean liner strikes an iceberg, it may make sense to question the course the owners took, or to ask the captain why he didn’t take more measures sooner. But during an emergency, decision makers can’t afford to get bogged down in defending or rationalizing past mistakes. The singular focus should be: What can we do now to save as many lives as possible?<br />As the government of Afghanistan collapses, the main concern of Washington policy makers should be how to rescue as many people as possible, particularly American service members, diplomats and Afghans and their families who are at risk because they helped the U.S.<br />It will be a moral stain if we leave behind those who fought alongside us, often in combat and at great risk to themselves and their families, who became targets for assassination. Leaving those courageous heroes behind will deter others from helping us in the future.<br />In April 1975, as Saigon was approaching collapse, Graham Martin, our capable but obstinate ambassador, was dragging his feet. Bing West, a Marine combat veteran then working for Defense Secretary Jim Schlesinger, says Schlesinger called Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to report that he was sending aircraft to evacuate Vietnamese who had worked with the U.S. Mr. Kissinger sided with Schlesinger, who then informed the White House that he was ordering an air evacuation. Despite receiving no confirmation from the White House, Mr. West recalls, Schlesinger proceeded to act.<br />That April, the U.S. Air Force flew 201 C-141 missions and 174 C-130 flights evacuating more than 45,000 Vietnamese to Guam. In addition, 71 U.S. helicopters flew 660 sorties, evacuating more than 7,800 people to Thailand or to U.S. ships. The aerial evacuation of South Vietnam was the largest such operation in history, with more than 50,000 evacuees transported mainly on U.S. Air Force aircraft.</td>

      <td>Biden says Kabul isn’t another Saigon. It may be more similar to Tehran in 1979.</td>
      <td>Joe Biden became Jimmy Carter on Sunday. On Monday he confirmed it in a speech doubling down on the decision that has given us the debacle unfolding in Afghanistan.<br />Years after President Carter departed the Oval Office, his name still remains a synonym for weak and inept. This reputation was cemented forever on Nov. 4, 1979, when Islamist students overran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 66 American hostages. One year later to the day, Mr. Carter was defeated by Ronald Reagan.<br />For President Biden and his team, the analogies to President Carter and the Iranian hostage crisis might be even more unsettling than the obvious parallels to the 1975 fall of Saigon they are working so hard to deny.<br />When the rescue mission Mr. Carter ordered in April 1980 ended up aborted with five airmen and three Marines killed—and the wreckage of U.S. aircraft lying in an Iranian desert—it only made him look more pathetic. A  New York Times  headline two weeks before the election summed up the Iranian crisis as “a metaphor for American weakness.”<br />Mr. Biden now owns the weakness. Yes, Donald Trump wanted out and negotiated a deal with the Taliban. But Mr. Biden is president, and the problem isn’t simply the withdrawal but the shockingly naive way he carried it out. All done, moreover, so he could score political points by using the coming 20th anniversary of 9/11 to portray himself as the man who ended America’s longest war.</td>

      <td>Until the 1990s, mainland China rarely ate raw food, including cabbage and salad greens. An enterprising Frenchman changed all that.</td>
      <td>A Westerner visiting China in the 1990s could expect dinner hosts to offer their guest “salad” alongside regional foods like Sichuan mapo tofu or Hunan red-braised pork. The then out-of-place dish was both a sign of respect for the visitor and a way of showing that China was opening up to “outside” ideas, even about cuisine. Yet, a Chinese offering of “sè-lā,” as the dish is pronounced in Mandarin, would often remain untouched. What passed for salad—diced potatoes tossed with Russian dressing, or a half-head of doubtful-looking iceberg drenched in an indeterminate glop—wasn’t very appealing alongside traditional Chinese fare.<br />Credit Frenchman Xavier Naville for better orienting salad in China. In “The Lettuce Diaries,” Mr. Naville recounts his unlikely story of creating a market there for the kind of salad greens familiar to Westerners.<br />When he arrived in Shanghai in the summer of 1997, the 27-year-old Mr. Naville was the impeccably dressed but woefully inexperienced head of finance for Asiafoods, a British-backed American startup that, like Sysco or Aramark, packaged “safe, hygienic meals” for “institutional canteens.” Within two years he had learned not only rudimentary Mandarin but also “all about the challenges with vegetable sourcing and growing in China—in both supply and hygiene.” He had also chanced upon a promising client, KFC, which needed a Chinese supplier of coleslaw and lettuce for its already more than 300 fast-food chicken restaurants on the mainland.<br />In the year 2000, Mr. Naville and an American vegetable-prep consultant spun off a few stainless-steel chopping tables at Asiafoods into a new venture, Creative Food, that would become, in Mr. Naville’s words, “the largest fresh-food company in China.” Bite into a chicken sandwich at a KFC in Shanghai today, or buy a bagged salad in a supermarket in Beijing, and there’s a good chance the operation Mr. Naville launched supplied the lettuce inside.<br />Until the advent of Western-style fast food in the 1990s, “the Chinese rarely ate raw vegetables,” Mr. Naville remembers. “I knew from our canteen menus that to them, raw food was not food, period.” But once urban diners acquired a taste for burgers and fries, raw salads became less of a stretch. Young, newly affluent Chinese consumers soon came to like bagged, chopped, pre-washed greens because they were as convenient as fast food but far more nutritious. “They were a new form of healthy food that preserved more vitamins than stir-frying vegetables in the traditional Chinese way,” Mr. Naville writes. Within seven years of its launch, he had sold Creative Food at a $20 million valuation.</td>

In a related filing, the company said the suit protests NASA’s decision on the lander, which it called improper. Blue Origin said it filed the suit under seal to protect sensitive information.<br />Last April, NASA awarded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., the formal name for SpaceX, a $2.9 billion contract to develop a vehicle that it would use to land astronauts on the moon under its Artemis program. Blue Origin and Dynetics, a unit of  Leidos Holdings Inc.,  had also competed to create a moon lander for the agency but failed to win part of the contract.<br />On Monday, a Blue Origin spokesman said the company filed the suit to remedy what it said were flaws in how NASA handled awarding the contract for the moon lander. The Verge earlier reported on the lawsuit.<br />NASA officials are reviewing the case, a spokeswoman said.</td>

      <td>The Biden administration unveiled the largest-ever increase in food-stamp benefits, boosting federal nutrition assistance after hunger surged in America during the coronavirus pandemic.<br />Following a review of the plan governing the nation’s food-stamp program, or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the average monthly SNAP benefit would increase by $36 a person to $169. The increase, which totals $1.19 a day, reflects higher costs for a nutritious diet, the USDA said on Monday.<br />The change, set to take effect on Oct. 1, marks a more than 25% jump from what participants would have received once temporary pandemic assistance ends. Before the pandemic, beneficiaries on average received $121 a month, the USDA said, though that amount swelled due to temporary coronavirus-related measures. SNAP helps to feed more than 42 million Americans, and the benefit increase is the biggest in the program’s nearly 60-year history.<br />Food prices are rising fast as U.S. food companies, facing the steepest inflation in a decade, pass along higher costs to consumers. At grocery stores, prices for foods from soup to meat are getting more expensive as large manufacturers such as  General Mills Inc.  and  Campbell Soup Co.  raise prices. Restaurants such as  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.  also are boosting menu prices.<br />The increases follow a rise in hunger last year as the coronavirus pandemic rocked the U.S. economy, closing businesses and pushing millions of people out of work, according to census data. Across the country, food banks and pantries struggled to cope with a surge in demand for their services as people sought free vegetables, milk and canned goods, hunger-relief organizations said.</td>

      <td>Move likely to hit farmers hardest, reducing access to region’s economic lifeblood amid protracted drought</td>
      <td>The federal government has declared the first-ever shortage of water on the Colorado River, triggering cutbacks in several states that will hit farmers particularly hard during a drought that has punished the Southwest with little letup since the turn of the century.<br />The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation made the declaration Monday after forecasting that Nevada’s Lake Mead, the river’s biggest reservoir, would remain below 1,075 feet above sea level—the mark previously set to trigger mandatory cutbacks—through at least early next year. As of Monday, Lake Mead measured 1,068 feet, the lowest since the reservoir was created by construction of the Hoover Dam in the 1930s. The bureau estimates the level will dip further to 1,066 by Jan. 1 next year.<br />The cuts, set to take effect in 2022, will primarily affect Arizona, which stands to lose 512,000 acre-feet, or 18% of its annual allocation—enough water to meet the annual household needs of a city the size of Phoenix. An acre-foot is roughly the amount of water a family of four uses for one year.<br />Nevada and Mexico will see their water allocations cut as well, by smaller amounts of 7% and 5%, respectively. They and Arizona have the most junior rights under a 14-year-old water-sharing agreement with the seven Colorado River Basin states, which also include California, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. If the reservoir keeps falling, as federal and state water managers fear it will, mandatory reductions could be imposed on states with higher-ranking rights, including California.<br />“Like much of the West, and across our connected basins, the Colorado River is facing unprecedented and accelerating challenges,” Tanya Trujillo, assistant secretary for water and science at the U.S. Interior Department, said in a statement. “The only way to address these challenges and climate change is to utilize the best available science and to work cooperatively across the landscapes and communities that rely on the Colorado River.”</td>

      <td>The Taliban’s return to power has spread fears about the nation’s future</td>
      <td>Afghanistan is again under the control of the Taliban, a fundamentalist group that ruled the nation for five years before U.S.-led forces ousted them in 2001. Their return to power is raising concerns across the region about rising numbers of refugees fleeing the group’s ultraconservative brand of Islam, and the potential that the Taliban might encourage Islamist movements elsewhere in Central Asia more than two decades after Osama bin Laden first sought refuge under their protection.<br />Taliban forces entered the capital of Kabul on Sunday after President Ashraf Ghani left the country, effectively ending a 20-year effort by the U.S. and other Western nations to remold Afghanistan as a modern democracy. They were buoyed in part by an agreement with the Trump administration in February last year for U.S. forces to leave the country, with President Biden subsequently setting Aug. 31 as the exit date. With Afghan government forces losing air cover and plagued by desertions, the Taliban quickly expanded their footprint in recent weeks, with the last remaining cities, including Kabul, falling under their control by mid-August.<br />Their arrival in Kabul coincided with scenes of panic in some quarters, with Afghans who worked with Western armed forces or agencies rushing to Hamid Karzai International Airport seeking a way out of the country to escape reprisals. Western embassies moved their staff to the airport, which is under U.S. military control, to help evacuate personnel. In chaotic scenes there, crowds of Afghans ran alongside military transport planes as they prepared for takeoff, with some people trying to cling to the sides of the aircraft.<br />Afghanistan’s national army and police forces, theoretically numbering 350,000 men and trained and equipped at huge cost by the U.S. and Western allies, were supposed to be a powerful deterrent to the Taliban. They were trained to match the way American forces operate, combining ground operations with air power and using aircraft to resupply far-flung outposts and collect intelligence.<br />But following Mr. Biden’s withdrawal plan, the U.S. pulled its air support, intelligence and contractors servicing Afghanistan’s planes and helicopters. That meant the Afghan military couldn’t function anymore. In many instances, soldiers simply changed out of the uniforms into civilian clothes.</td>

      <td>An adaptation of journalist Amanda Ripley’s book sends four high-school students around the world to see what lessons the education systems of other countries hold for America.</td>
      <td>Investigative journalistAmanda Ripley avoided writing about education for most of her career, having found it less daunting to concentrate on crime, natural disasters and terrorist attacks. “The conversation in the United States about education could not be more stagnant”—nor, she adds, does it ever involve students, something she sought to alleviate with her 2013 book, “The Smartest Kids in the World.”<br />In her adaptation on Discovery+, director Tracy Droz Tragos employs the same basic format as Ms. Ripley’s book, following four American high schoolers as they explore education in countries that rank significantly higher than the U.S. on the PISA test, the Programme for International Student Assessment, which measures the ability of 15-year-olds to use reading, mathematics and science knowledge to meet real-life challenges. PISA is the yardstick by which national rankings are measured in the show. Ms. Ripley is the program’s very knowledgeable guide, who weighs in here and there to put matters in perspective. The stars are the four high-school juniors who have taken the daring step of spending a year abroad, in school systems they each know nothing about.<br />The results are enlightening, perhaps a little depressing: The U.S. spends more than almost every other developed nation per capita on education and gets a discouraging return on its investment: At the time the documentary was shot, the international ranking of the U.S. was 31st in math and 23rd in science. But the reasons why—as precisely as they can be determined—seem to be largely about philosophy rather than innate student ability.<br />It’s an unwieldy subject Ms. Tragos has taken on, and the results are somewhat scattershot—the students’ personal experiences are mixed with a survey of educational approaches and, as a result, certain questions about cultures, ethnicities and languages get lost. The encouraging thing is how simple some improvements might be to implement here. Others seem impossible: Sports, which benefit only a fraction of any U.S. student body, are the kind of diversion of educational resources and energy you find virtually nowhere else in the developed world.<br />The students are from disparate regions of the U.S., and all are seeking a more challenging education. Simone goes to South Korea; Jaxon goes to the Netherlands; Brittany goes to Finland; Sadie goes to Switzerland. Each national system provides food for reformist thought, not only in contrast with the U.S. but with each other: Nothing could be more different than the stress-filled South Korea system—with its high-pressure testing and emphasis on rote memorization—and Finland, where students come and go as they please and where the attitude, even compared with America, seems almost lackadaisical. And yet Finland and South Korea achieve comparable PISA rankings. (In what’s almost an aside, one Finnish student tells the camera that Finns are not required to continue their education after middle school, “so everybody here wants to be here.” One cannot say that about many American high schools, and it probably skews the rankings.)</td>

It’s also part of what has emerged as a genre—the high-end serialized soap with marquee names and a generous proportion of upscale problems. The creator-producer of these shows is often David E. Kelley; the stars are often Nicole Kidman (“The Undoing”), Reese Witherspoon (“Little Fires Everywhere”) or both (“Big Little Lies”). The various series are not unwatchable. They are frustratingly unbingeable.<br />“Nine Perfect Strangers,” which begins Wednesday with three of its eight episodes, was adapted by Mr. Kelley and John Henry Butterworth from the 2018 novel by Liane Moriarty, who also wrote the novel “Big Little Lies” and seems to have distilled a successful formula down to just a few ingredients: Appalling behavior, sordid revelations and money. Not every episode was made available by Hulu for review, which was also true of HBO’s “The Undoing,” a Kelley production that sandbagged its audience by having the obviously guilty party be the guilty party. No producer wants to risk his surprise ending. Or the fact that he doesn’t have one.<br />The strangers of “Nine Perfect Strangers” are introduced as they make their way to Tranquillum House, a Northern California health retreat that at least one guest has found by Googling “most expensive.” The travelers include the Marconis— the “overly loquacious” and compensating Napoleon (Michael Shannon), his sour wife, Heather (Asher Keddie), and daughter, Zoe (Grace Van Patten), all aiming to get past the death of Zoe’s twin brother one year before. Jessica (Samara Weaving) and Ben (Melvin Gregg) have marital problems. Lars (Luke Evans), an investigative reporter whose boyfriend has just dumped him, is at Tranquillum under what he smugly thinks are false pretenses. Carmel (Regina Hall) is too nice not to be crying herself to sleep every night.<br />“Nine Perfect Strangers” isn’t funny, but it is farcical, beginning with the initial encounter of Frances (Melissa McCarthy) and Tony (Bobby Cannavale). A successful novelist, Frances has just gotten word from her agent that her publisher wants to buy out her contract and has pulled her BMW onto the shoulder to vent. Tony, with good intentions, stops his car because he sees her on the edge of an embankment screaming at the top of her lungs. The two hate each other at first sight, and the scene, like many others, is allowed by director Jonathan Levine to continue 1. to the point of absurdity and 2. to the point where we stop believing in the characters as plausible human beings. With the exception of Ms. Van Patten’s Zoe, you wouldn’t give your extra bottle of kombucha to any of these people.<br />They have all come to see Masha (Ms. Kidman), described as a “mystical Eastern-Bloc unicorn,” a guru who looks Elvish (à la “The Lord of the Rings”) and sounds like Bela Lugosi. (You can imagine her muttering, ominously, “I never drink . . . chai lattes.”) The point of her Russian origins is to give her an authoritarian air and some shadowy connections: At some point in her hazy professional past someone came very close to murdering her in—what else?—a parking garage. “You have all come here to die,” Masha tells her already anxious clients, whom she has instructed to dig their own graves and lie in them. “I will bring you back.” She is speaking metaphorically, but some unknown party is texting her actual death threats.</td>

      <td>Axel Springer SE is in talks to purchase an ownership stake in Washington, D.C. publisher Politico, according to people familiar with the matter, a deal that would consummate a yearslong relationship between the two companies.<br />The deal talks aren’t final and could still fall through. The talks also include the possibility of a full buyout, the people said.<br />The German publisher teamed up with Politico in 2014 to launch Politico’s European edition the following year in a 50/50 joint venture. The operation is based in Brussels with offices throughout the continent.<br />Axel Springer, which owns the German newspapers Bild and Die Welt, has been adding to its U.S. media holdings in recent years. The company purchased Business Insider in 2015 for about $500 million and recently bought Morning Brew, a digital publisher that has focused largely on business.<br />Launched in 2007, Politico reshaped Washington coverage with its blanket reporting on all things political, rapid-fire blog posts, morning email blasts and in-depth tracking of elections and legislative happenings. That later paved the way for a move toward events and high-price subscription services.</td>

      <td>Amid the Afghanistan debacle, the president faces a new press environment.</td>
      <td>The emerging disaster in Afghanistan has forced the president to cut short a trip to Camp David and respond to a suddenly aggressive press corps. Amid scenes of desperate Afghans trying to climb aboard departing U.S. aircraft and reports of a number of deaths at the chaotic Kabul airport, the president is returning to the White House, where he plans to deliver remarks in the East Room at 3:45 p.m. ET on Monday. For the first time in his presidency, he cannot count on a generally amicable media reception.<br />Scott Whitlock of NewsBusters writes:<br />Perhaps media folk are upset at being misled last month in the East Room when Mr. Biden offered a picture of the situation in Afghanistan that has proven to be entirely false. Speaking of Afghan interpreters and others who assisted U.S. forces, Mr. Biden told reporters that “our message to those women and men is clear: There is a home for you in the United States if you so choose, and we will stand with you just as you stood with us.” It’s now clear that many of our friends are standing alone and in grave danger, trapped inside the country now ruled by the Taliban.<br />Mr. Biden offered other misrepresentations to the assembled media, according to the following excerpts from the official White House transcript:<br />Mr. Biden was also specifically asked about a scenario like the one the world is now witnessing:</td>

      <td>Oil prices fell on Monday, extending a recent stretch of turbulent trading after data showing that China’s economic recovery slowed more than anticipated last month.<br />U.S. crude prices fell as much as 4% before ending the day down 1.7% at $67.29 a barrel. They are near their lowest levels since late May and 11% below last month’s multiyear high. Prices have retreated as cases of the Delta variant of the coronavirus surge around the world, fueling fears that a new wave of travel restrictions will soften demand for fuel.<br />The spread of the Delta variant and extreme weather contributed to a larger-than-expected slowdown in China’s economy in July, figures released Monday showed. Indicators of industrial, consumption and investment activity all showed growth retreating faster than expected and decelerating from June’s yearly growth rates.<br />The data are a concern for commodity traders because China is the world’s largest importer of oil and a huge consumer of other raw materials such as copper. Weakness in China’s economy can quickly spread around the world, analysts say, particularly when travel patterns and supply chains are being disrupted as they are now due to the coronavirus.<br />“Concerns about the spread of the Delta variant in China, and the effects this will have on oil demand, are continuing to weigh on prices,” Commerzbank analysts said in a note.</td>

One, we’ve obviously had higher inflation outcomes than we anticipated, and I believe that the substantial further progress on inflation has already been achieved. It hasn’t changed my longer-run outlook for inflation very much though, so my forecast for inflation next year, using the [personal-consumption expenditures price index] inflation would be around 2.1%, so slightly above our target.</td>

The companies said they expect those results shortly and will then submit the data to the FDA.</td>

      <td>The fall of Kabul has been heard around the world, to the dismay of our allies and delight of our enemies.</td>
      <td>‘You were given the choice between war and dishonor. You chose dishonor and you will have war.” Winston Churchill’s words to Neville Chamberlain following the Munich agreement echo grimly across Washington this week as the Biden administration reckons with the consequences of the worst-handled foreign-policy crisis since the Bay of Pigs and the most devastating blow to American prestige since the fall of Saigon.<br />Joe Biden believed three things about Afghanistan. First, that he could stage a dignified and orderly withdrawal from America’s longest war. Second, that a Taliban win in Afghanistan would not seriously affect U.S. power and prestige world-wide. Third, that Americans were eager enough to put the Afghan war behind them that voters wouldn’t punish him even if the withdrawal went pear-shaped. He was utterly and unspinnably wrong about the first. One fears he was equally wrong about the second. We shall see about the third, and his Monday afternoon speech staunchly defending the pullout indicates that he believes he can carry the country with him.<br />The bipartisan scuttle caucus of which President Biden is a founding member—and former President Trump an eager recruit—argued that withdrawal would enhance rather than undermine American credibility. Ending a war in a remote country of little intrinsic interest to the U.S. does not, one can argue, make America look weak. If anything, the two-decade U.S. intervention testifies to an American doggedness that should reassure our allies about our will. At the same time, cutting our losses after 20 years of failing to build a solid government and military in Afghanistan demonstrates a realism and wisdom that should reassure allies about Washington’s judgment.<br />Defenders of the withdrawal argue this is one way that America can reduce its footprint in peripheral theaters to focus on the principal threat in coastal East Asia. Why should the U.S. government pay the heavy price—in military resources and in the political costs at home of defending an endless engagement in a remote part of the world—required to contain the Taliban? Isn’t the jihadist group a more direct threat to both Russia and China than to America? Why are U.S. soldiers fighting and dying so that Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping have one less headache to worry about?<br />A well-executed withdrawal that visibly served a coherent national strategy might have accomplished what Messrs. Trump and Biden hoped. But that is not what we have, and the Biden administration is facing a major test of credibility. The president’s tragically misguided press-conference remarks of July 8, in which he doubled down on naively optimistic predictions that would have embarrassed Baghdad Bob, cast a shadow over the president’s judgment that will not be easily or quickly dispelled.</td>

      <td>The biology behind ‘breakthrough’ cases and the confusing CDC mask guidance.</td>
      <td>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s latest Covid guidelines have many Americans confused. Vaccinated people are supposed to resume wearing masks, lest they contract and spread the virus. Yet unvaccinated people are still strongly urged to get the shots, which are said to be highly effective. How can both these claims be true?<br />The answer is that there’s more than one kind of immunity. Internal immunity protects the inside of the body, including the lungs. This occurs by release of antibodies of the Immunoglobulin G type, or IgG, into the blood and production of T-cells. Vaccines injected into our muscles are highly effective at stimulating internal immunity. This largely protects vaccinated people from being overwhelmed by the coronavirus, unless they have an immunodeficiency or are exposed to an unusually large amount of the virus. Vaccination will dramatically reduce your likelihood of serious illness or death if you’re exposed to SARS-CoV-2.<br />In contrast, mucosal immunity provides the first line of defense by protecting the nose and mouth, and by doing so also reduces spread to others. The mucous membranes secrete a particular form of antibodies of the Immunoglobulin A type, or IgA. But vaccines injected into our muscles—including all the approved inoculations against Covid—are largely ineffective at stimulating the secretion of IgA into our noses that occurs after actual infection with a virus. As a result, vaccinated people can contract a Covid-19 infection confined to the mucous membranes. They may get the sniffles but can spread the virus to others even if they are asymptomatic. That’s why it makes sense for them to wear a mask under some circumstances.<br />All this has implications for public-health authorities’ determination to achieve herd immunity through vaccination alone. In the Provincetown, Mass., outbreak, which informed the CDC’s recent change in guidelines, viral loads in the nose were “similarly high” in the vaccinated and unvaccinated, suggesting that the vaccine’s efficacy against infection in the nose had fallen to zero with the advent of the Delta variant. That would mean herd immunity through vaccination is impossible.<br />But this data appears to be distorted by ascertainment bias: The vaccinated people who showed up for testing were disproportionately those who were symptomatic. Better-controlled data from the Mayo Clinic suggests that efficacy of the vaccines against nasal infection, including asymptomatic cases, has fallen from the original level of around 90% to 76% for the Moderna vaccine and 42% for the  Pfizer  vaccine since Delta’s emergence. It follows that herd immunity from intramuscular vaccination is still possible, but it would require either a higher level of vaccination or continued masking and social distancing.</td>
