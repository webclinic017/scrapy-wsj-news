      <td>More Americans have died of the virus in 2021 than in all of 2020.</td>
      <td>President Biden may not recall what he said during a 2020 campaign debate last fall, but Americans should: “Anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as President of the United States of America.” At the time the U.S. had recorded 220,000 Covid deaths.<br />Covid deaths this year have now surpassed the toll in 2020 with 350,000 since Inauguration Day. It would seem that Mr. Biden has done no better than Donald Trump in defeating Covid despite the benefit of vaccines, better therapies, and more clinical experience. The left politicized Covid by holding Mr. Trump responsible for a disease that was always going to be hard to defeat.</td>

      <td>Democrats have agonized for months over where to find money for their blowout tax and spending bill, so it’s worth paying attention to the revenues they explicitly forgo. The bill offers tax breaks for key progressive constituencies, and one that has received little attention is a big gift to Big Labor.<br />The bill the House passed would allow union members to deduct up to $250 of dues from their tax bills. The deduction is “above the line,” meaning filers can exclude the cost of dues from their gross income. In other words, union dues would get the same treatment now reserved for things like insurance premiums and retirement contributions. The deduction would last through 2025. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates its cost at $1.8 billion.</td>

      <td>Jokes about Communist Party longevity are no laughing matter in China.</td>

The American says he can go into the Oval Office, pound the desk, and say he doesn’t like the way the President is running the country. The Russian replies that he can do that too: Any time he wants he can go into the Kremlin, pound on the desk, and say he doesn’t like the way the American President is running his country.<br />We thought of that joke upon reading that Jamie Dimon, the JP Morgan Chase CEO, apologized this week for joking about China’s Communist Party. “I was just in Hong Kong and I made a joke that the Communist Party is celebrating its hundredth year. So is JPMorgan. I’d make you a bet we last longer,” Mr. Dimon said Tuesday at an event in Boston.</td>

      <td>How thoroughly do investment managers screen the companies in their environmental, social and governance funds? Not very, if the example of videogame company Activision Blizzard is typical.<br />Activision—maker of “Call of Duty,” “World of Warcraft” and “Candy Crush Saga”—has drawn numerous complaints from employees and regulators of sexual misconduct, retaliation and discrimination, yet it’s included in many prominent ESG funds. In July the company was sued by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing. Among other things, the state alleged “women were subjected to constant sexual harassment, including groping, comments, and advances,” and “the company’s executives and human resources personnel knew of the harassment and failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the unlawful conduct, and instead retaliated against women who complained.” One employee committed suicide after male co-workers allegedly passed around a picture of her genitals at a holiday party. Activision says the lawsuit is “meritless and irresponsible.”</td>

The next day, the Biden administration replaced the FHFA director, Mark Calabria, with a temporary appointment. Get ready for another housing boom—and bust.<br />FHFA is the regulator of the two government-backed housing lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Mr. Calabria had been working to spin off Fannie and Freddie, hoping to reduce the harm they could do to the economy. But the Biden administration’s replacement immediately reversed course. “There is a widespread lack of affordable housing and access to credit, especially in communities of color,” said Acting Director Sandra Thompson. “It is FHFA’s duty through our regulated entities to ensure that all Americans have equal access to safe, decent, and affordable housing.”</td>

      <td>Bumble Inc.  may never have the broad appeal of dating giant  Match Group ,  Inc., but it is looking more lovable. Since going public in February, its share price has dropped 54% from where it opened on its first day of trading. Over just the last three months, it is down 36%, while Match’s share price has fallen less than 2%.<br />Bumble was founded to turn dating on its head, empowering women to make the first move in an attempt to curb aggressive or unwanted advances from men online. The “woke” message resonated with investors initially but, including the lesser buzzed-about Badoo, Bumble has just two dating apps compared with Match’s more than 10 brands. A survey earlier this year from Evercore ISI found that, of males and females using both apps, a significantly higher percentage of both groups were more satisfied with Tinder.</td>

It gave me pleasure just to be sitting in a Los Angeles theater waiting for the first beam of light from the projector to hit the screen. True to the filmmaker’s devotion to theatrical exhibition, he held advance showings in a landmark movie palace with a screen so big that it set up great expectations—which were fulfilled by his hugely enjoyable tale of young love and seductive prospects in the San Fernando Valley during the early 1970s. (Currently playing in select theaters, the film will go into wide distribution on Dec. 25.)<br />The Valley, a suburban ribbon of strip malls, tract houses, wooded estates and pop-culture fame, is where Mr. Anderson grew up and where he set three of his seven previous features: “Boogie Nights,” “Magnolia” and “Punch-Drunk Love.” His new one, much too kinetic and surprising to qualify as nostalgia, takes place a few years before the raunchy events of “Boogie Nights,” his rise-and-fall chronicle of a porn star. The title is slang for a vinyl record, as well as the name of a small record-store chain of that era. The running time is unexceptional in one sense, a few minutes over two hours, but notable in another. In their passionate pursuit of one another, the couple-to-be spend so much time running along the Valley’s streets and boulevards that you’d hardly know they live in car-culture heaven.</td>

It isn’t about the Beatles, or about cars, for that matter, though it builds on the special intimacy of sitting in a car next to a significant someone. It isn’t in English, except for a few words and phrases now and then; the main languages, all subtitled, are Japanese, Korean and Korean Sign Language. It is not three hours long, as I’d been told, a piece of fake news that had me feeling antsy in advance. The whole thing comes and goes in 2 hours and 59 minutes and seems an hour shorter, because what it is can be summed up in a word that’s often used loosely but fits the case here—a masterpiece, a mysteriously enthralling creation that keeps you guessing about where it’s going, then reveals its essence with astonishing clarity. (Currently playing in New York theaters, the film will open in Los Angeles next week, then go into wider distribution later in the month.)</td>

      <td>There’s a convention in literature and film called the unreliable narrator. According to one definition I came across online, it’s a character whose telling of the story “is not completely accurate or credible due to the character’s mental state or maturity.” Keep that in mind as you read what I have to say about “House of Gucci,” playing only in theaters, because the unreliable narrator may be me. I found the film so insistently campy yet painfully mirthless—its style lies somewhere between opera buffa and telenovela—that my mental state of acute anguish may have skewed my perceptions of whatever the story has to offer. A woman sitting next to me at the screening laughed all but uncontrollably throughout. Who am I to say she didn’t know what she was laughing about and I’m the reliable one?<br />By everything that’s unholy the story should have been irresistible, an Italianate fashion-world version of “Succession” with murder waiting in the wings. Lady Gaga is Patrizia Reggiani, the outsider from humble beginnings who married into the Gucci clan; lived a lavish life at the center of decades-long scramblings for corporate power, intricate maneuverings, familial betrayals and slow-burning dynastic downfall; and, in 1998, was sentenced to 29 years in prison for arranging the killing of her ex-husband, Maurizio Gucci, who is played gamely by Adam Driver.</td>

Though the rambling movie hasn’t been received warmly by many critics, it unsurprisingly features some standout outfits. Its costume designer, Janty Yates, who has long collaborated with Mr. Scott, won an Oscar for her work on his 2000 movie, “Gladiator.” Despite the at-times-unflattering story, Gucci (now owned by the Kering conglomerate, not the family) supported the movie, granting Ms. Yates access to its archive and letting the production shoot at one of its Milan boutiques.</td>

It comes as Turkey seeks much-needed foreign investment and offers the oil-rich U.A.E. potential support in a broader struggle against Abu Dhabi’s other main regional rival, Iran.</td>
