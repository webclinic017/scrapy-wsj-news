      <td>An ill-fated crossing of the English Channel ended in a maritime disaster, with long-running consequences for a dynasty.</td>
      <td>Just before midnight on Nov. 25, 1120, the White Ship left the northern French harbor of Barfleur, bound for the English port of Southampton. On board the stately vessel were nearly 300 passengers, including the aristocratic elite of the prosperous Anglo-Norman realm then ruled by Henry I. Foremost among them, and the focus of Henry’s dynastic hopes, was his sole legitimate son and heir, the 17-year-old William Ætheling.<br />Warmed by several barrels of wine, the White Ship’s boisterous company anticipated a swift and uneventful crossing of the English Channel. But the crew and helmsman were also tipsy, and the voyage had barely begun before it ended in catastrophe. Just a mile offshore, the White Ship struck the notorious Quilleboeuf rock, keeled over and foundered in the frigid sea. There was only one survivor, the humble butcher Berold. As the White Ship went down, Berold testified, William Ætheling’s bodyguard hustled him aboard the lone rowboat. But when he heard the anguished cries of his half-sister, Matilda of Perche, the prince insisted upon turning back, and the dinghy was swamped and sunk.</td>

His service extended to the Thatcher era and he had assisted refugees from the world’s many despotisms. He was attacked in a church during his regular Friday constituent meeting.

The rest is history. The poet Philip Larkin satirized the moment: “Sexual intercourse began in 1963.”<br />The cosmology of 21st-century wokeness is similar to that of the freshly formed counterculture in the 1960s. Wokeness, however, doesn’t assert that there was nothing prior to the current great awakening. Instead, it claims there was nothing good—merely the wickedness of the American past and Western civilization, which has “got to go,” Mozart and all.</td>

But it also reinforced the urgency of reasserting broader American leadership in space.<br />Nearly 25 years ago, when I testified before Congress on space-related developments—and delays—my primary concern was that we were failing to approach the future with the same energy, ambition, vision and execution that characterized our moon missions. Areas of particular concern included American leadership in near-Earth orbit, heavy launch, reusability, public-private partnerships, international cooperation, pioneering civilian space tourism and getting back to the moon and on to Mars.</td>

      <td>A change in posture will be necessary.</td>
      <td>Regarding William Galston’s column “Will America Come to Taiwan’s Defense?” (Politics & Ideas, Oct. 13): The policy of strategic ambiguity is still useful; what matters is how it is implemented. The steady deterioration of American naval power in the Taiwan theater makes things far less ambiguous to China’s leadership. For example, dispatching our sole operational aircraft carrier in the South China Sea to the Persian Gulf to support our withdrawal from Afghanistan is a clear indication of America’s weakened ability to implement any policy.<br />There is no effective way to guarantee that China will choose not to invade Taiwan unless we change our posture from one of deterrence to prevention. That is, simply remove invasion as an option for the People’s Liberation Army. This can be accomplished by placing large U.S. and allied military assets in the Taiwan Strait and on Taiwan itself and keeping them there for an extended period, probably until Xi Jinping is no longer in office. This would require a change in the culture at the Pentagon and Foggy Bottom from one of timidity and vacillation to one of decisiveness and courage—not an easy business.</td>

One is Justice Tamara Barringer, a former state senator. The other is Phil Berger Jr., a former North Carolina Court of Appeals judge who was elevated by the voters to the state’s highest court a full 10 years after his father became president pro tempore of the state Senate.<br />Justices Barringer and Berger Jr. were not elected by the people with the assumption that they would not hear cases involving the constitutionality of our state’s laws. The attempt to disqualify them from hearing cases the voters elected them to hear is a subversion of the will of the people and an insult to every informed voter. It would call into question the legitimacy of the state Supreme Court and do lasting damage to the confidence we have in our electoral process in North Carolina.</td>

      <td>Countries will still be free to define exclusions.</td>
      <td>The proposed 15% global corporate minimum tax is a big idea (“The Global Tax Damage,” Review & Outlook, Oct. 9), and on the surface it might seem like a no-brainer. But tax policy and legislative history, along with the history of the shenanigans used to get around restrictions provided by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, prove that the 15% rate will not end up solving the problem. (A review of the changing Internal Revenue Code sections regarding domestic international sales corporations is instructive.)<br />Countries will still be free to define tax expenditures—exclusions from income, deferrals of income, deductions and credits as they see fit. It is unlikely that a global treaty that limits their ability to do so could be crafted and approved. Just as a tax base can be broadened and the tax rate lowered, a tax base can be narrowed and a tax rate increased. Narrowing the tax base could, in effect, keep the tax due where it was before the increase in the rate. Assuming the 15% initiative gets past our Senate, it will be interesting to see how it all turns out. In the meantime, it will create work for the accountants and tax lawyers who have undoubtedly started brainstorming ways around it.</td>

An information panel placed next to the sarcophagus in the 1960s identified it as the “Tomb in Which Andrew Jackson REFUSED to be Buried.” It stood, in other words, as a symbol of the down-to-earth essence of American republicanism and its distaste for the vulgar bric-a-brac of monarchy or autocracy.<br />The sarcophagus had been discovered in Lebanon in 1837 and brought to the U.S. a couple of years later by Commodore Jesse D. Elliott, the commander of a squadron of the U.S. Navy on patrol in the Mediterranean.

      <td>Companies are spending on capital goods again, but will it work?</td>
      <td>I’ve spent a lot of time this year on the twin threats of inflation and rising bond yields. Add in soaring energy prices and pending Christmas shortages and it sometimes feels like everything’s awful. But there is a bull case to be made that two decades of depressed productivity are about to come to an end.<br />The basic case is that companies are investing again, and that higher capital spending quickly translates into a lift in productivity. The headwinds that held back spending in the last two cycles—caution following the aftermath of the dot-com excess and a lack of credit after the 2008 financial crisis—have gone. And companies have a strong incentive to invest, because labor is no longer cheap, with wages rising fast and firms reporting difficulties in hiring.</td>

Bank of America’s third-quarter profit rose 58% from a year earlier, aided by $1.1 billion in loan-loss reserves. Banks’ lending businesses were in a slump despite the improving U.S. economy. Bank of America shares gained 4.5% Thursday.<br />Amazon is priming some of its employees for more work from home. Chief Executive Andy Jassy said in a memo to employees Monday that corporate team directors would now decide whether staff need to work from the office. The company will give corporate employees the option to work as many as four weeks a year remotely from anywhere in the country in which they are employed. The rest of the time, Mr. Jassy said he wants most of those workers close enough to their core teams that they can get to the office within a day’s notice. Amazon is the latest company to add flexibility to its remote-work options, which have become a key aspect of recruiting and retaining U.S. employees in the tight labor market.

It was created in 1997 and since then has expanded several times. It is a credit that reduces taxes owed as opposed to a deduction that reduces taxable income. The temporary changes in effect for 2021 make it a near-universal monthly child allowance, far from the annual tax break it started as.

Natural immunity is recognized in Europe. An Israeli study earlier this year showed the stronger and longer-lasting benefit of natural immunity.

      <td>Key variable for retail sales going into the holidays seems to be the state of Covid-19 rather than what is on the shelves and how much it costs</td>
      <td>Shortages are making it harder and more expensive for Americans to find what they want to buy. That didn’t stop them in September.<br />Supply-chain issues and inflation may count as big problems for U.S. consumers, but the pandemic is still what matters most. Covid cases fell last month, and people spent more. The Commerce Department on Friday reported that retail sales—spending at stores, restaurants and online—rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7% in September from a month earlier. Economists expected a decline of 0.2%. The Commerce Department also upwardly revised its August and July sales figures.</td>

      <td>Stocks are sky-high and bond yields are near zero. A strategy called ‘return stacking’ can free up part of your portfolio to put to work in a quieter part of the investing world.</td>
      <td>When there’s nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, what do you do?<br />U.S. stocks aren’t far from their all-time highs, while the income investors can earn from bonds is a pittance. So investing in stocks feels risky, and bond yields are too thin to do you much good.</td>

      <td>The researcher and writer who has made the world of social insects his life’s work has also become their interpreter.</td>
      <td>A well-known portrait of Edward Osborne Wilson shows the smiling Harvard professor hovering, like a benevolent god, over some models of his cherished leafcutter ants. The photograph serves as the cover of “Tales From the Ant World,” Mr. Wilson’s most recent and, by my count, 35th book. The large ant right beneath Mr. Wilson’s chin, a mix of Mars Rover and de Chirico mannequin, wields a leaf almost as big as the entomologist’s head. The proportions seem off, but in a larger sense they really aren’t: As Mr. Wilson, now in his 90s, has reminded us over a long, distinguished career, ants can more than hold their own against humans. There are, by some rough estimates, 10,000 trillion ants in the world at any given moment, and their combined weight (Mr. Wilson, who likes to mock his ineptness at math, nevertheless supplies numbers whenever he can) would match the total weight of the planet’s human population.<br />Mr. Wilson has always had a knack for reducing complex problems to simple number games, easy-to-grasp metaphors or memorable anecdotes. A world-famous scientist, winner of many medals and honorary doctorates, celebrated for his research on ant communication and evolutionary equilibrium in island settings, he has also swept up awards in the field of literature, including two Pulitzers and, for his novel titled (what else?) “Anthill” (2010), the Chicago Tribune Heartland Prize for fiction. Earlier this year came the ultimate literary sanctification, inclusion in the venerable Library of America, where Mr. Wilson is now rubbing shoulders with just a handful of other nature observers: John James Audubon, Rachel Carson, Loren Eiseley, Aldo Leopold and John Muir. And, as if further corroboration of Wilson’s eminence were needed, we now also have “Scientist,” a full-length biography by Richard Rhodes, whose previous work in the genre includes the popular “John James Audubon: The Making of an American” (2004).</td>

      <td>Combining the material and the ethereal, Hans Holbein brought a haunted quality to pictures with a political edge.</td>
      <td>We trust that political art is always bad art, but Hans Holbein the Younger, one of the first masters of the modern character study, was a political artist to the tip of his brush. He was also, as Franny Moyle shows in this intricate and enlightening study of Holbein and his age, a religious artist about whom we know very little.<br />Contemporary sources, Ms. Moyle admits, are “sparse, to say the least.” Holbein was present at the court of Henry VIII and the creation of modern England. His absence from the records has formed an invitingly blank canvas for novelists, including Ford Madox Ford and Hilary Mantel, but created a challenge for historians. Ms. Moyle makes ingenious use of the literary equivalent of chiaroscuro, shadowing in what we know of the times so that the outline of the life shines brightly; as well as of sfumato, the “smoky,” allusive blurring of details that made Renaissance paintings shimmer with significance.</td>

      <td>A polymath with a high-velocity pen, Coward masked exactitude with effervescence.</td>
      <td>The young Noël Coward was often disparaged as a boy who was clever and knew it. You have to admire his response: “How do they think I could be clever and not know it?” The logic and tone are distinctively Coward’s. Here was confidence and reasonableness and a nimble wit able to render ambition and even arrogance appealing. And, obviously, a dramatic flair for turnabout.<br />By the time the shy and gangly Noël reached his teens, he was a veteran of the English stage. He’d turned pro—begun drawing a salary—at the age of 10, performing in a fairy play. Noël was born in 1899 into a middle-class family of exaggerated ancestral glory (manorial estates and family crests floated dimly in the golden background), and the theater provided him with something more than an escape—a princely, if wobbly, palace of powder and paint. He made it his own. Eventually, he made an even larger domain his own: He became a dispensary of words through a host of written and spoken media. There can’t be another English artist, rooted in theater, whose career exhibited mastery of such scope: He was playwright and actor, screenwriter and film director, songwriter and singer and cabaret artist, poet and fiction writer and autobiographer—the list goes on.</td>
