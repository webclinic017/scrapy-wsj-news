      <td>The Fed chairman says everything the White House wants to hear.</td>
      <td>The verdict may be out on Jerome Powell as a central banker, but the Federal Reserve chairman is a first-rate politician. His much-awaited (virtual) speech at the Jackson Hole monetary conference on Friday offered a sunny view of the economic horizon and an extended apologia for the Fed’s performance on his watch. You might think he’s running for office . . . oh, wait, he is hoping for a second four-year term as chairman, and President Biden will make his decision soon.<br />The main headline from the speech is that on present course the Fed will begin to taper its extraordinary monthly bond purchases this year. But in case anyone thought this means monetary tightening, Mr. Powell quickly noted that the Fed isn’t about to shrink its balance sheet, now up to $8.3 trillion, or raise interest rates for a very long time.<br />The message is that the Fed will remain super-accommodative, even as nominal GDP could grow 10% this year. Investors, who love the Fed’s support for asset prices, bid up stocks on the news. This won’t hurt Mr. Powell’s renomination chances at the White House.<br />Mr. Powell justified the Fed’s continued and historic policy ease on grounds that while the outlook for the job market is excellent, the labor market recovery has been uneven. But then it always is after a recession. Mr. Powell’s case is that the 5.4% unemployment rate “understates the amount of labor market slack.”<br />He could be right, though one reason for any slack is that the government welfare and jobless benefits that Mr. Powell cheered on earlier this year are paying people more not to work than if they take a job. No mention of that in his remarks.</td>

      <td>President Biden and his wife paid their respects Sunday at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to the 13 Americans who died at Kabul airport last week, and well they should. We are learning more about these young men and woman, and their deaths are all the more painful because they were sent on a selfless rescue mission.<br />They range in age from 20 to 31, represent a mix of ethnic groups, and hail from the middle-class, patriotic families who always bear the worst burden of war. Their family members say most of them joined the military out of individual purpose and national pride. They are the volunteers who follow orders and man the ramparts no matter the risk or ill-advised war plan.<br />Nicole Gee, recently promoted to Marine Sergeant, was from Sacramento and married to a fellow Marine, Jarod Gee. Only days before her death she posted on Instagram a now famous photo of herself cradling a young Afghan baby. “I love my job,” she wrote. She was 23 years old.<br />Lance Cpl. Jared Schmitz, 20, always wanted to be Marine. His “entire world was the US Marine Corps,” his father Mark Schmitz wrote, according to CNN. “Ever since he committed himself to the Marines in high school, he wanted to join. He showed a level of dedication that I haven’t seen.” Schmitz, of Wentzville, Mo., had been posted to Jordan and was among those sent to Kabul as Mr. Biden’s Afghan withdrawal turned to chaos.<br />Lance Cpl. Rylee McCollum, of Jackson, Wyo., was “bound and determined” to join the Marines, said Cheyenne McCollum, one of his three older sisters, according to the Journal. “He knew it from the time he was 4.”</td>

      <td>The Democratic budget bill will be loaded with major policy changes.</td>
      <td>Political attention on Bernie Sanders’s spending plan is focused on the $3.5 trillion cost, and understandably so. It’s unprecedented. But more important are the enormous policy changes that will be buried in the fine print and that the media will barely notice.<br />One example emerged last week as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told Democrats that the bill will include a “Clean Electricity Payment Program.” He said this will “put our country on the path to meet President Biden’s climate change goals of 80 percent clean electricity and 50 percent economy-wide carbon emission reduction by 2030.”<br />This is a national renewable-energy mandate on the sly. Utilities would have to buy or generate a certain amount of renewable energy each year. Those that don’t meet their quotas would be fined while those that exceed targets would receive payments from the feds that they must spend on increasing renewable energy or reducing electricity prices.<br />An honest national renewables mandate would run afoul of budget reconciliation rules. But the liberal outfit ThirdWay says the Clean Electricity Payment Program “is a purely budgetary proposal (involving only spending and revenue) as opposed to a regulatory approach” and “the enforcement mechanism is simply payments and fees.” Therefore it can dodge a Senate filibuster.<br />The idea resembles the Obama Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan, which required states to reduce CO2 grid emissions by shutting down coal plants and using more renewables. The Supreme Court blocked the EPA rule in 2016 after states argued it violated the Clean Air Act and unconstitutionally conscripted them.</td>

      <td>A federal monitor lists the damage from the progressive purge.</td>
      <td>Across urban America the evidence is piling up that when you demonize police and cut their budget, you get more crime. The latest example is Seattle, where slashing the police budget has imperiled reform and endangered poor and minority communities.<br />Federal Judge James Robart oversees a longstanding police-reform consent decree between the Department of Justice and city of Seattle. Last week his court released video footage of a hearing this month in which monitor Antonio Oftelie lists Seattle’s political impediments to protecting public safety.<br />The City Council cut the 2021 police budget by nearly $35.6 million, or about 9%, compared to 2019. Councilor Kshama Sawant claimed “the role of the police under capitalism” is “to defend the system’s deep inequality through ongoing repression of the poor, the marginalized, and communities of color.” Other councilors signed a pledge to address “the on-going assault on Black lives perpetuated by a well-funded police state that acts with near impunity.”<br />In Mr. Oftelie’s new semi-annual report, Police Chief Adrian Diaz describes how “amidst often hostile rhetoric,” the department “experienced an unprecedented exodus of officers to other jurisdictions.” Since Jan. 1, 2020, some 287 Seattle cops have retired or resigned.<br />Police spokesman Randall Huserik says the department has pleaded with the City Council for money to attract new applicants. The department has also sought permission to reallocate money that would have paid the departed officers’ salaries. The City Council has approved neither request, and police have hired only 87 new officers in two years.</td>

      <td>How to rescue more Afghans after Biden’s deadline expires.</td>
      <td>An emotional President Biden pledged Thursday to evacuate American citizens from Afghanistan as well as the Afghans who had supported our hastily abandoned mission. “We will not be deterred by terrorists. . . . We will rescue the Americans who are there. We will get our Afghan allies out, and . . . continue to execute this mission with courage and honor.”<br />Unfortunately the president’s self-imposed Aug. 31 deadline means that many of the people to whom he made that promise will still be trapped in Afghanistan after evacuation flights end. To keep at least part of his promise, the president needs to authorize clandestine exfiltrations by declaring to the relevant congressional committees that continuing the evacuation is in the national interest.<br />Such a declaration, commonly called a “finding,” is delivered to the congressional committees with oversight of covert operations. It would create and formally authorize a clandestine program, bringing with it resources, manpower, money and congressional buy-in, so that the Central Intelligence Agency and others can achieve the declared objective of evacuating Americans and Afghan allies.<br />Weeks before the president’s public promise, scores if not hundreds of U.S. veterans volunteered to rescue their countrymen trapped in Afghanistan as well as those Afghans who fought with and for us. Frustrated “that our own government didn’t do this,” one of the volunteers told ABC News, “we did what we should do, as Americans.”<br />Gripping accounts are emerging of the so-called Pineapple Express, a remarkable testament to the values and courage of the men and women who make up our volunteer military and the civilians who support them. ABC reported that as of Aug. 26, the effort had saved more than 500 at-risk Afghans by getting them inside the Kabul airport.</td>

      <td>The convergence of many seemingly unrelated elements has produced an explosion of brainlessness</td>
      <td>‘Stupidity,” Jean Cocteau remarked, “is always amazing, no matter how used to it you become.”<br />We live in a golden age of stupidity. It is everywhere. President Biden’s conduct of the withdrawal from Afghanistan will be remembered as a defining stupidity of our time—one of many. The refusal of tens of millions of people to be vaccinated against the novel coronavirus will be analyzed as a textbook case of stupidity en masse. Stupid is as stupid does, or, in the case of vaccination, as it doesn’t do. Stupidity and irresponsibility are evil twins.<br />The slow-motion zombies’ assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6 was a fittingly stupid finale to the Trump years, which offered dueling stupidities: Buy one, get one free. The political parties became locked in a four-year drama of hysteria and mutually demeaning abuse. Every buffoonery of the president and his people was answered by an idiocy from the other side, which in its own style was just as sinister and just as clownish.<br />Cable news provided the Greek chorus. American government and politics became cartoons. The Democrats, all unknowing, played Wile E. Coyote to Mr. Trump’s Road Runner. Twice, the Democrats’ Acme Impeachment Committee rigged up the big bomb (heh heh), lit the fuse and held its ears. Both times, the Road Runner sped away. Beep beep!<br />“Trump is crazy!” “Trump is Hitler!” “Trump is a Russian agent!” “Bob Mueller has the goods!” Beep beep!</td>

      <td>When my four sons act out, I ask if they remember a violent rainforest episode.</td>
      <td>I miss travel, though I definitely don’t miss airports. But slow security lines and overpriced paninis will be worth it again soon, because great life lessons emerge in the oddest places. Way back, my family took a trip to Costa Rica. They have beaches, volcanoes, rafting, ziplines, horseback riding, hikes, hanging bridges. What’s not to like?<br />Early in the trip, my wife and I, along with our four sons, stayed at an “eco-hotel.” The rooms had little cardboard placards bragging about how much water and carbon they didn’t use, and there were plenty of vegan choices at the buffet breakfast, next to the eggs and bacon. I asked the front desk what “eco-hotel” meant and was told that it was just branding to get Americans and Germans to stay there—they weren’t doing anything different than before they adopted the moniker.<br />On our first morning, our guide, Alberto, picked us up in his van and unloaded us at some important rainforest, grabbing a tripod-mounted Swarovski spotting scope. He marched us maybe 50 yards in, stopped to set up the scope, and launched into a long-winded description of the very rare and elusive three-wattled bellbird, a favorite of birdwatchers because of its clanging metallic voice. He stared into the telescope, spun it around, huffing and puffing and searching so long that I began to suspect the bellbird was extinct.<br />The rest of us were bored to tears. After 20 minutes, my eldest started flicking something at No. 2. Yes, sometimes it is just easier to number them. He didn’t like having things flicked at him, but his older brother was bigger, so he started poking at No. 3, who started screaming, “Don’t touch me because I don’t like being touched.” Then No. 3 started picking on our youngest, pushing in the back of his knees so he couldn’t stay standing up.<br />Alberto kept droning on about mating habits and migratory patterns. As my youngest kept getting bullied, he started sobbing to my wife. This went on for a while until she turned to me and told me to do something about it. I didn’t think she was actually paying attention to Alberto or even interested in the mythical three-wattled bellbird. None of us were. She just wanted the bickering to stop. So what did I do? I reprimanded my eldest for starting the chain reaction. It didn’t matter; within minutes the flicking, touching, sobbing and “do something about this” pleading continued. Ah, the circle of dominance and submission.</td>

For advocates of peace and freedom, this makes him persona non grata. At the International Monetary Fund, he’s a valued member.<br />So too are the governments of socialist, deadbeat Argentina and of El Salvador, which every day slips further into arbitrary, authoritarian rule.<br />These are some of the bad actors in the Western Hemisphere who received more “special drawing rights” from the IMF on Aug. 23 as part of a new $650 billion general allocation. They don’t play by the rules of the international community, but suddenly hundreds of millions of dollars at rock-bottom rates are falling into their coffers.<br />SDRs are created out of thin air but can be converted, on demand, into hard currency.

      <td>Are educational apps really going to improve a child’s academic skills or, with their busy images and graphics, are they closer to a videogame?</td>
      <td>As children return to school this fall, their parents’ attitudes toward technology may well shift. The 18 months of the pandemic and lockdown have revealed both the astonishing ability of computers to connect us and their troubling inability to teach children, especially younger ones, much of anything. For many older children—even if they were indeed able to learn something on Zoom—the substitution of screens for in-person socializing seems to have led to mental-health problems.<br />Journalist Sophie Brickman was on the verge of completing her examination of technology’s effects on children and child-rearing when the pandemic hit. Fortunately, the unusual circumstances didn’t shake her from her well-researched and unvarnished conclusions. As the months stretched on in self-quarantine, she writes in “Baby, Unplugged,” she found herself grateful for “researchers who’ve hammered home that for young children, particularly the preschool set, free play and imagination and even boredom are the best activities to fill the day.”<br />Ms. Brickman acknowledges that working parents—really, most parents—must occasionally make use of screens. But she doesn’t allow herself (the book’s subtitle is “One Mother’s Search for Balance, Reason, and Sanity in the Digital Age”) or any of her parent-readers to give up on the task of setting screen limits simply because they are stuck in an apartment or house all day with small, needy children.<br />Early in her narrative, Ms. Brickman describes herself as the Luddite in her own marriage. Her husband is perpetually bringing home new gadgets. Little wonder that a man who judges the previous night’s sleep based on messages from his wristwatch has no problem with using technology to monitor and entertain the children. But Ms. Brickman begins to wonder why she suddenly finds herself eager to measure her newborn’s weight, feeding habits and sleep schedule with a slew of apps and devices. Maybe there’s some evolutionary drive to gather information, she thinks, but she is disturbed to see how obsessive she has become: She wants to know, for instance, whether her left breast or right breast produces more milk. There is merchandise on offer for people who are thinking in this way, she notes: changing tables that measure a baby’s weight with each new diaper, “smart socks” that keep track of a baby’s vital signs when he is asleep. Ms. Brickman concludes that, far from aiding in the rearing of a child, such products will only serve to make parents crazy.<br />Ms. Brickman offers reports from pediatricians who explain that if a child really needed such a precise level of monitoring, he would probably be in a hospital. She draws a similarly skeptical conclusion about the many other products that parents can now choose from, products that, quite apart from monitoring and measuring, will supposedly make their children happier and healthier. Each is designed in ways that, it is claimed, will improve a baby’s habits or make life easier for parents—from the Wi-Fi-enabled FormulaPro, which can be programmed by a smartphone to prepare bottles, to a $1,300 smart bassinet, “which adjusts its rocking and white noise to soothe fussy babies.” One psychologist, adding some perspective on the wide array of products, tells Ms. Brickman: “Appreciate that good enough is almost always good enough.”</td>

It added that signs that the reactor is now being operated coincides with indications that North Korea is also using a nearby laboratory to separate plutonium from spent fuel previously removed from the reactor.<br />The agency, whose inspectors were kicked out of North Korea in 2009, described the twin developments as “deeply troubling” and a clear violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions.</td>

It came as the U.S. scrambled to have its military and diplomatic personnel out of the country by Tuesday, the deadline previously agreed upon by the Taliban before it would take control of the airport in Kabul.<br />The drone took aim at a vehicle carrying suspected suicide bombers, the Pentagon said. The U.S. believed it successfully struck the vehicle, but couldn’t say how many bombers were hit.<br />The initial battlefield assessment concluded that no civilians had been killed, the military official said.<br />The Biden administration said it remained committed to Afghanistan after Tuesday’s final withdrawal, even as the U.S. presence faded fast amid mounting security concerns.</td>

Mr. Biden on Saturday called them “heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice in service of our highest American ideals and while saving the lives of others.”<br />Joining Mr. Biden was his wife, Jill Biden, and a large group of officials including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin; Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Gen. David Berger, the Marine Corps commandant; and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.<br />Eleven of the transfers were witnessed by reporters, with the two others conducted in privacy at request of family members. Sobbing was audible to reporters as the families looked on.</td>

      <td>“The Kabul Airport Massacre” (Review & Outlook, Aug. 27) is a tragedy resulting from incompetence. “The buck stops with me,” President Biden read from the teleprompter at his press conference, and then he promptly blamed everyone else for his mistakes. He blamed former President Trump for making a deal with the Taliban that resulted in no U.S. casualties for 18 months. Mr. Biden didn’t explain why he chose not to overturn such a bad deal while overturning so many of his predecessor’s other initiatives.<br />Mr. Biden blamed his generals for recommending that we abandon Bagram Air Base in favor of the insecure Kabul airport. If that’s true, then the generals responsible should be fired immediately.<br />He blamed U.S. citizens stranded in Afghanistan for not wanting to leave. It might be safer for them to stay rather than risk getting killed on the way to the airport.<br />He blames ISIS for the killings and threatens to track down and kill its members, but he trusts the Taliban to act as TSA agents providing safe passage to the airport. Maybe he forgot that Islamic terrorists, no matter how they are labeled, are committed to killing Americans.<br />Ultimately, voters are to blame for electing this president. America deserves better.</td>

The more you oppose someone, the more she will dig in to her position.<br />Developed at the University of California, San Francisco Center for Excellence in Primary Care, the Hear Technique is a simple way to respectfully engage with people who are skeptical or have strong emotions about the vaccine. “Hear” is an acronym that stands for: hear, express appreciation, ask about pros and cons, and respond.<br />Hear. Use an open-ended question to invite the person to share more about her perspective. Or use reflective listening to show the person that she has been heard.<br />Express appreciation. It is a gift when someone shares her reasoning for not following your recommendation. Showing gratitude lets the person know that you respect her and will engage in nonjudgmental conversation.<br />Ask about pros and cons. Most people have arguments on each side of the question. Understanding personal motivations can open doors to more discussion.</td>

      <td>The savings spill over into traditional Medicare and even into the nonelderly, commercially insured market.</td>
      <td>In “The Danger of Expanding Medicare” (op-ed, Aug. 26), former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal could have added that shifting seniors from traditional, fee-for-service Medicare to Medicare Advantage managed care generates substantial healthcare cost reductions. The fiscal savings spill over into traditional Medicare and even into the nonelderly, commercially insured market.<br />Harvard’s Katherine Baicker, Michael Chernew and Jacob Robbins have showed that as penetration of Medicare Advantage increases in different counties, hospital costs and length-of-stays decline not only for seniors enrolled in Medicare managed care plans, but also for beneficiaries still on the traditional program. For every 10% increase in the uptake of Medicare Advantage, inpatient spending among fee-for-service Medicare seniors falls by 5% to 10%. Similar findings are also observed among commercially-insured people under 65 in regions with rapid diffusion of Medicare Advantage.<br />Why is this the case? Medicare Advantage plans receive a fixed lump-sum from the government for each senior they enroll. They then pass along that incentive to doctors and hospitals, encouraging them to deliver efficient, coordinated care. Since healthcare providers typically treat all three beneficiary groups—traditional Medicare, Medicare Advantage and other privately insured patients—any changes in treatment and practice patterns fostered by Medicare Advantage spread to the care delivered to all patients.<br />Promoting competition and managed care in the Medicare program is the appropriate prescription for curbing healthcare cost growth.<br />Nathan Punwani, M.D.</td>

      <td>A new ‘diversity index’ and a subtle change in a question have resulted in an undercount of whites.</td>
      <td>The most common reaction to the release of the 2020 census was summed up in the headline “Census Data show the number of white people fell.” The data show the number of whites declining by 8.6%. This observation was often coupled with a political projection: that while gerrymandering could benefit Republicans in 2022, the political future belongs to the Democratic Party, which commands large majorities among minorities.<br />But these conclusions about race and politics rely on misleading census results. Contrary to Democratic hopes and right-wing anxieties, America’s white population didn’t shrink much between 2010 and 2020 and might actually have grown.<br />“Races” are defined not by biology but by cultural convention. As late as the early 20th century, many Anglo-Americans didn’t identify Southern or Eastern Europeans as “white.” In 1918, 33-year-old Harry S. Truman, while visiting New York City, wrote his cousin: “This town has 8,000,000 people. 7,500,000 of ’em are of Israelish extraction. (400,000 wops and the rest are white people.)” After World War II, Jews and Italians became identified as “white.”<br />Something similar seems to be happening to many Americans of Hispanic and Asian origin. About 3 in 10 Hispanics and Asians intermarry, usually to a white spouse. According to a 2016 study by economists Brian Duncan and Stephen J. Trejo, 35% of third-generation Hispanics of mixed parentage no longer identify as Hispanic; and 55% of third-generation Asian-Americans of mixed parentage no longer identify as Asian. A 2017 Pew report found that among Americans of Hispanic origin who don’t identify themselves as Hispanic, 59% said that they were seen by others as white.<br />The racial identity of Hispanics is especially confusing because the census asks about “Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin” separately from race. In the 2010 census, 53% of those who said they were of Hispanic origin checked off only “white,” a 58% increase in numbers from 2000. That rise in white Hispanics helped account for the increase in the number of whites from the prior census. But in the 2020 census, a mere 20.3% of Hispanics checked off only “white,” contributing to the 8.6% decline in the total number of people identifying only as white.</td>

      <td>The Taliban’s control of the government will significantly increase their wealth and influence.</td>
      <td>‘Our only vital national interest in Afghanistan,” President Biden said two weeks ago, “remains today what it has always been: preventing a terrorist attack on American homeland.” To prevent such an attack, Mr. Biden and Congress should swiftly work to deprive the Taliban and their al Qaeda allies of the resources required for attacks on the U.S. homeland.<br />While the Taliban have been subject to American terrorism sanctions for years, the group’s newfound control of Afghanistan’s government institutions and domestic resources will significantly increase its wealth and influence. If the new Taliban government’s central bank, ministries and agencies are not explicitly subjected to U.S. sanctions, the Taliban will be better able to use that money as it wishes. According to a 2020 United Nations Security Council report, before their takeover of Afghanistan, the Taliban operated a sophisticated financial network that generated between $300 million and $1.5 billion a year, primarily from illicit mining, narcotics production and trafficking, and taxation in areas they controlled. All these sources of income are likely to grow enormously as the Taliban consolidate control of nearly the entire country.<br />Al Qaeda remains intricately tied to the Taliban, so the new regime’s resources will be available to committed international terrorists. The U.S. military is now warning that al Qaeda’s operational capabilities are rapidly increasing. This should come as no surprise given that one of the Taliban’s deputy emirs, Sirajuddin Haqqani, is a longstanding al Qaeda ally and the head of the Haqqani network, an American-designated terrorist organization.<br />U.S. laws and regulations governing money laundering and illicit finance have come a long way since 9/11. Congress and successive administrations have developed sophisticated financial sanctions targeting terror-sponsoring regimes like Iran, Syria and North Korea. Washington should apply what it has learned to isolate the Taliban government and its terrorist allies.<br />Declaring the new Afghan government a state sponsor of terrorism would impose restrictive measures on trade and allow Americans harmed by Taliban-aided terrorists to pursue legal action against the regime. The State Department should also designate the Taliban a Foreign Terrorist Organization. While the Taliban is currently subject to financial sanctions under Treasury Department counterterrorism authorities, an FTO designation would further chill any interaction with Taliban-affiliated entities and expose anyone providing them support to extraterritorial criminal prosecution and civil liability.</td>

Nearly two-thirds of the flow came from large cities and their close-in suburbs.<br />Exurban areas, which include 240 counties as defined by the Brookings Institution, grew at almost twice the national rate over the past decade, a shift that began before the pandemic.

The company, a major borrower in international bond markets, had rattled global investors earlier this year after it delayed the release of its annual results.<br />The figures, issued late Sunday Hong Kong time, showed that Huarong had made a net loss of about 103 billion yuan last year, equivalent to $15.9 billion, as it took huge write-downs on its assets. Those impairment charges were equivalent to $16.7 billion.<br />Huarong, which is majority owned by China’s Ministry of Finance, had warned on Aug. 18 that it expected to make a net loss equivalent to about $16 billion for 2020.

But the market so far hasn’t cooperated, reflecting continuing demand from around the globe.<br />Treasurys cleared their latest big hurdle Friday when Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell delivered a highly anticipated speech at the central bank’s annual symposium hosted by the Kansas City Fed. Analysts had thought Mr. Powell might offer clues as to when the Fed might start scaling back its $120 billion in monthly asset purchases, including $80 billion of Treasurys—the type of move that sent shudders through the bond market in the 2013 taper tantrum.<br />Mr. Powell complied, to a degree, saying he thought the process likely could start before the end of the year. Yields, though, fell when his prepared remarks were made public, underscoring the market’s near-indifference to tapering since the topic arose toward the end of last year.</td>

He replaced it with a new, larger Bolt model that wasn’t subject to the safety callback.<br />“I thought, ‘Great, I’m out of the woods,’” he said. But two weeks later,  General Motors Co.  expanded its recall to include every Bolt it has built, including his own vehicle. The chartered accountant from Toronto is keeping the car but adding a networked fire alarm in case it catches fire.<br />GM this month expanded the Bolt safety recall for the second time, calling back the roughly 142,000 models built since it went on sale five years ago. The Detroit auto maker also paused production of all new Bolts. The safety action on its lone U.S. electric car will cost GM an estimated $1.8 billion, or around $12,700 per car, among its costliest recalls.<br />The safety problems underscore the risks for traditional auto makers as many take a sharp turn toward electric vehicles. The high cost of energy-dense lithium-ion battery cells means replacement expenses can spiral when defects occur.  Ford Motor Co. ,  Hyundai Motor Co.  and other car companies have been hit with huge costs to fix relatively small numbers of electric cars.<br />For GM, the recent troubles come as it tries to convince consumers and investors that it is ready to lead the car industry’s transition to electrics. While the cars have been recalled, GM and battery-cell supplier  LG  Energy Solution still don’t have a fix.</td>

      <td>Bill Crawford, 83, a retired Chevron senior marketing representative living in Anchorage, Alaska, on his 1960  Volkswagen  Karmann Ghia convertible, as told to A.J. Baime.<br />In Alaska, we have four seasons: June, July, August and winter. When my wife, Gaye, and I first moved here in 1977, as soon as summer started, we couldn’t believe how many classic cars were coming out of people’s garages. The collector car atmosphere in Alaska is unbelievable. But it is also seasonal. This time of year, we especially love our cars because we often get snow as soon as September.<br />When I was growing up, I had a favorite uncle, who was a decorated World War II Marine named Al Guerard. He owned a 1960 Volkswagen Karmann Ghia. When he died in 1981, I told my aunt that I would like to buy his car, but she knew how much it would mean to me. So she gave it to me. In 1983, I went to Pebble Beach, California, where she lived, picked up this car, drove it to Seattle, and put it on a barge bound for Alaska.<br />Up here, you don’t see many of these cars. There are lots of classic  Porsche s, Volkswagens and British cars like MGs and Austin-Healeys. But very few Karmann Ghias. The car was built from 1955 to 1974, and back then there were a lot of them around. [According to VW, the company built 362,601 coupes and 80,881 convertibles, with a majority of those cars sold in the U.S.] Today the younger generation has no idea about what this car is and about its unique history.<br />A German manufacturer named Wilhelm Karmann partnered with an Italian car design house called Carrozzeria Ghia. They went to Volkswagen and asked if they could put this body on a Volkswagen chassis. So that is what happened. Like the Volkswagen Beetle, the VW Karmann Ghia has its engine in the back.</td>

They see potential as the Covid-19 pandemic has prompted more people to seek help for addiction, depression and other issues, according to federal data.<br />“It’s creative and we certainly need the help,” said Ken Duckworth, medical director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. “It’s an interesting idea to post a mental-health resource at a place where people already are at.”<br />CVS earlier this year started stationing mental-health providers, typically a licensed clinical social worker trained in cognitive behavioral therapy, at 13 locations in Houston, Philadelphia and Tampa, Fla., as a pilot program. The company said it saw a surprisingly high return rate for customers who had an initial consultation, and is now expanding the program to 34 locations in those areas.<br />Some healthcare providers question how many people are comfortable seeking therapy in such a public setting, despite a growing acceptance and understanding of mental-health issues. CVS says other customers would have no way of knowing that a person is getting mental-health help, given that the stores offer a range of wellness services. Mental-health services are advertised inside the stores, where an area designated for medical services includes a private room for counseling sessions.</td>

      <td>SINGAPORE—A surge of Covid-19 cases in Malaysia, a little-known but critical link in the semiconductor supply chain, has opened a new front in the battle to fix manufacturing woes that have rippled across industries during a global shortage of computing chips.<br />The Southeast Asia nation is one of the world’s top destinations for assembly and testing of the devices that control smartphones, car engines and medical equipment. Disruptions in Malaysia threaten to prolong uncertainty over chip supply well into next year, dashing hopes of relief in the second half of 2021.<br />The supply crunch in Malaysia, caused primarily by staff shortages linked to virus-control measures combined with a sharp surge in global demand, poses a new problem for the auto industry. For the first half of this year, shortages largely stemmed from companies miscalculating the pace of economic recoveries and not ordering enough parts. Now they can’t always get the parts they need because Covid-19 outbreaks are denting factory output.<br />“It’s a bit like a game of whack-a-mole,” said Ravi Vijayaraghavan, a Singapore-based partner at the consulting firm Bain & Co. specializing in semiconductors. “We think we have supply sorted out, and then a problem suddenly pops up somewhere else.”<br />Some of the world’s leading car makers including  Toyota Motor Corp. ,  Ford Motor Co. ,  General Motors Co.  and  Nissan Motor Co.  have disclosed major production cuts due largely to chip shortages from factories in Malaysia. Ford suspended work for about a week at an F-150 plant in the Kansas City, Mo., area and a Fiesta factory in Cologne, Germany because of missing parts, while Toyota said it would cut global production by around 40% in September. General Motors said it expects to make 100,000 fewer vehicles in North America in the second half of the year.</td>

      <td>A sharp two-month drop in production has tanked global-iron ore prices and burnished China’s climate credentials</td>
      <td>HONG KONG—A two-month fall in China’s steel output, ordered by economic officials, handed Beijing a global showcase for advancing climate goals and controlling commodity markets. A brewing economic slowdown is testing the government’s will to sustain the cuts.<br />China’s production of crude steel, half the world’s annual total, fell in July by the widest year-on-year margin since the 2008 global financial crisis. Early indicators suggest it might slip again this month. Culled by state inspections and other official curbs at mills nationwide, the usually prodigious flow that is often the subject of global trade and environmental tensions has fallen by 12.5 million metric tons—about twice Britain’s annual total—in July from May’s record high.<br />The steel cuts have driven global iron-ore prices down 40% since mid-July, delivering China twin triumphs: a show of policy leadership ahead of a major climate summit in Glasgow in November, and a demonstration that it can tamp down rising global commodity prices. Beijing has set a national goal to secure peak carbon emissions by 2030, with an earlier target of 2025 for the steel sector, China’s second-largest such emitter after power utilities.<br />“We have to resolutely implement the output-cut policy—this is a political issue, and there is no room for bargaining,” said Chen Derong, chairman of Baowu Steel Group, China’s largest producer, at a conference this month. Also this month, climate envoy Xie Zhenhua said China plans to stick to its emissions goals and present them in Glasgow.<br />But with the economy slowing as Covid-19 surges once more, China’s top brass has begun to provide some wiggle room. A high-level meeting in late July chaired by President Xi Jinping warned against “campaign-style” climate measures. State media weighed in to discourage “unrealistic pledges.”</td>

Big winners include utility  NextEra Energy Inc.,  which is up 14% this quarter, while shares of medical company  Danaher Corp.  are up 19%.<br />The gains are noteworthy because investors typically pile into those types of stocks when they are expecting the outlook to darken. Visits to the doctor and electricity use are less apt to decline in a pinch than spending on vacations or new furniture. Goldman Sachs this month cut its third-quarter U.S. economic growth forecast to 5.5% from 9%, citing slowing consumer spending in the face of renewed Covid-19 outbreaks.<br />A drop in economic growth from its mid-2021 pace hardly presages a recession, which is the development that often spells the end of stocks’ advance. But rallies in these so-called defensive sectors can presage broader market retreats, investors say, potentially spelling out a fresh test for a market whose post-pandemic rise has surprised many stock-market bulls.<br />“When those sectors are doing well, as they’re doing now, that tells you that the market is bracing for either a slowdown in the economy or some sort of a correction in the broad market,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity-market strategist at asset manager Federated Hermes.</td>

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Kabul airport attack that killed 13 American troops and nearly 200 Afghan civilians.<br />The missile used by the U.S. in the airstrike, called an R9X, is inert. Instead of exploding, the weapon ejects a halo of six large blades stowed inside the skin of the missile, which deploy at the last minute to shred the target of the strike, allowing military commanders to pinpoint their target and reduce the possibility for civilian casualties.<br />The use of the special Hellfire missile, which inside the military is referred to colloquially as “the flying Ginsu,” recalling the popular knives sold on TV infomercials in the 1970s, hadn’t been disclosed.

      <td>Eating spicy chilies has the effect of a self-induced chemical attack. The evolutionary puzzle is figuring out why we do it.</td>
      <td>Humans like to eat a lot of strange things—decomposed shark, Namibian warthog rectum, British food—yet among the strangest is our taste for chili peppers: a fruit that, ecologically speaking, specifically evolved to repel us.<br />Although chilies meet the culinary definition of a spice or vegetable, from a botanical point of view, they are fruits—berries, to be specific. But whereas other berries have thorns to protect against seed-destroying predators, chilies have a defense mechanism in the form of the chemical compound capsaicin, the principal function of which is to cause pain for predators. The scientific term for this is “directed deterrence.”<br />Birds, which are natural seed dispersers and excrete seeds whole and intact, are immune to capsaicin, a biological reward for helping chilies to spread and propagate. Humans, by contrast, are an ecological threat to chilies, because our mammalian teeth tend to crush and destroy seeds. We can sense capsaicin at a minuscule one part per million (consider that our threshold for sensing salt begins at about 2,000 parts per million and for sugar, around 5,000).<br />It’s not our sense of taste that’s doing the work here but our trigeminal or chemical sense, which registers sensations of irritation, temperature and touch to alert the body of potential harm. In fact, the same pain sensor that alerts us to capsaicin, TRPV1, also responds to physical heat, specifically temperatures above 109°F. So eating a pepper isn’t unlike, say, being stung by a bee, licking a nine-volt battery or burning your tongue on scalding hot coffee—all sensations intended to warn the body of exposure to harm and if necessary to trigger a series of protective reflexes.<br />Bite into a habanero pepper or order your food “Thai hot,” and your body essentially thinks it’s being attacked by a chemical weapon. Beyond the burning pain, which is supposed to compel you to reject or eject spicy food, you’ll probably begin to sweat as your body attempts to flush your system; your nose will run to protect your nasal passages; your eyes will water to protect your corneas; you’ll produce excess saliva to purge your mouth; and you might cough or sneeze to protect your airways. These are many of the same defense mechanisms you’d expect if you were to choke on a pretzel or eat something you were allergic to.</td>

      <td>Theranos Inc. once symbolized how Silicon Valley’s hustle and innovation might revolutionize healthcare. Its collapse made it a cautionary tale about investors putting blind faith in unproven technologies and allowing self-mythologizing entrepreneurs to operate in a culture of secrecy.<br />Today, as Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes prepares to go on trial on charges of defrauding investors and patients, health-tech investing is soaring, showing that the allure of startups building better healthcare has only intensified in the years since the sector’s most prominent failure. Ms. Holmes has pleaded not guilty, and jury selection in her trial begins on Tuesday.<br />Investment in healthcare startups rose 51% last year to $48 billion, according to PitchBook Data Inc. It has already matched that record this year as venture-backed companies pursue new treatments and aim to weed out inefficiencies in the healthcare system at a time when the needs and possibilities for innovation in the field appear stronger than ever.<br />Venture capitalists and fund managers say the glut of capital also has intensified some of the perils that contributed to the Theranos disaster. A frenetic race to get in on deals across all sectors of startups has emerged, they say, often resulting in founders getting uncontested control and leaving little room for investor diligence and discipline around valuations. Such situations can create opportunities for companies to make exaggerated claims about their technology and conceal mistakes.<br />Beth Seidenberg, a trained physician and one of Silicon Valley’s earliest biotech investors, said advancements in technology and biology are colliding with the Covid-19 crisis to accelerate new diagnostics and therapeutics, and describes the moment as “the golden age of biotechnology.”</td>

      <td>Investors are realizing that President Xi Jinping’s rhetoric on inequality is far more than just empty sloganeering</td>
      <td>After decades of hewing to Deng Xiaoping’s maxim that it is OK for some people to become wealthy first, Beijing suddenly seems more inclined to eat its rich—or at least take a healthy nibble out of their fortunes.<br />Following the high-profile crackdown on tech firms like Alibaba and Meituan, an Aug. 17 speech from President Xi Jinping on “common prosperity” caught investors’ attention. Mr. Xi called for rationally “adjusting” excessive incomes and for high-income individuals and companies to contribute more to society. He also called for more aggressive measures to expand the middle class and the social safety net, including health and elderly care.<br />China has long been one of the most unequal major economies in the world, with one common measure of income inequality, the Gini coefficient, at 0.465 in 2019 according to official data out of a possible 1.0. Wealth inequality is higher: The top 1% hold 30.6% of the country’s wealth according to Credit Suisse data, below the U.S. at 35.3% but well above the U.K., Japan and Italy.<br />But rapidly falling birthrates, the coronavirus pandemic and its aftermath have made inequality tougher to ignore. The political stumbles and anticompetitive practices of tech titans like Alibaba and Tencent have also handed Mr. Xi a convenient target for the public’s ire. As a result, high-net-worth individuals and internet tech firms could come under further pressure to “donate” resources to social causes and find their tax rates rising. China’s long-mooted property tax could finally become a reality, although that is less certain.<br />Beijing’s response to the pandemic focused on loan forbearance for businesses and goosing credit growth rather than direct support for households as in the West. That helped small businesses survive and positioned China well for rebounding exports. But it also meant a big income loss for average households and even more debt as housing prices headed skyward again. The climb in China’s household debt over the past half-decade has been among the most impressive in recent global history: one reason consumption has remained stubbornly weak this year, even as income growth has finally rebounded.</td>

To contemporary sensibilities, the pre-revolutionary French probably could have used at least a rinse. Especially since public sanitation was rudimentary and the streets held sewage runoff. In Patrick Süskind’s 1985 historical novel “Perfume,” he describes this period as foul: “...There reigned in the cities a stench barely conceivable to us modern men and women.”<br />But the French did their own version of a daily toilette. Many doused themselves in cologne and changed into a fresh linen shirt. At the other extreme, first-century Romans bathed for multiple hours a day in large groups (albeit without soap). In many places in the world, including parts of India, the local watering hole or river is still the spot to clean one’s body—and clothes, and dishes. As Katherine Ashenburg wrote in her 2008 historical account of bathing, “The Dirt on Clean,” “Even more than in the eye or the nose, cleanliness exists in the mind of the beholder.”<br />That perspective might be good to keep in mind for those engaged in the current online debate over showering. This month, the endearingly scruffy actor Jake Gyllenhaal gave a freewheeling interview to “Vanity Fair” in which he said he finds bathing “less necessary.” He continued, “I do also think that there’s a whole world of not bathing that is also really helpful for skin maintenance, and [our bodies] naturally clean [themselves].” (He also said that he is “baffled that loofahs come from nature.”)<br />That “world of not bathing” appears to be located right around the axis of Hollywood, given the number of celebrities that have chimed in on their own philosophies of hygiene. On an appearance on Dax Shepard’s “Armchair Expert” podcast this summer, actors Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis described their laissez-faire approach to bathing themselves and their kids. Mr. Kutcher said, “I wash my armpits and my crotch daily, and nothing else ever.” When it comes to the kids, he said, “If you can see the dirt on ‘em, clean ‘em, otherwise there’s no point.” After the subject exploded on Twitter, Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson weighed in on the opposite end of the spectrum, saying he showered three times a day. These celebrities declined to comment further on the topic for this column.</td>

      <td>An exhibition vividly portrays the artist’s formation without suggesting success was foreordained</td>
      <td>Watermill, N.Y.<br />When scholars examine a famous artist’s early work, the temptation is to search for portents—to find in classroom studies any nascent motifs that point to future prowess and foretell mastery as inevitable.<br />One of the refreshing aspects of “Roy Lichtenstein: History in the Making, 1948-1960” at the Parrish Art Museum is that the curators haven’t surrounded this period with an aura of destiny. One walks through the three rooms and sees the artist testing out a bewildering variety of styles and subjects without ever settling on one. Not until 1960, when he was in his late 30s, did he discover the formula—figures lifted from American comic books, outlined in black, filled in with bright primary colors and abstracted by Ben-day dots—that became a defining signature of Pop Art.<br />Until then, as the show succinctly documents, Lichtenstein roamed blithely through the annals of art and illustration. He painted tank-like figures that recall the Surrealism of Max Ernst and the eccentric classicism of John Graham (“The Diver,” c. 1948-49). He made tapered sculptures in wood and metal that invoke African and Northwest American Indian art (“King,” c. 1951). He satirized U.S. history painting (“Washington Crossing the Delaware,” c. 1951) by flattening the heroic figures of Emanuel Leutze’s panoramic canvas in the manner of Picasso’s “Three Musicians.”<br />Elements of his later style are visible but not yet synthesized. Images of cartoon animals from about 1958—installed in a section of the show titled “Glimmers of Pop”—lack the flat-toned audacity of his post-1960 paintings. A brush-and-ink drawing of a reclining Bugs Bunny renders his buck-toothed head as if he were a hallucination or perhaps one of De Kooning’s “Woman” paintings. Two drawings of Mickey Mouse are more disturbing than droll.</td>

Foo Fighters and Fall Out Boy have pulled out of shows because of infections in their camps, while Garth Brooks, Florida Georgia Line, Nine Inch Nails, Stevie Nicks and Limp Bizkit canceled tours altogether.</td>

      <td>Efforts by the new breed of financial entities, if successful, could create more competition for traditional banks</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Cryptocurrency companies want to tap into the Federal Reserve payments systems that traditional banks use to move money around quickly. The banks are pushing back.<br />The companies include Avanti Bank, which aims to provide custody services for institutional investors in cryptocurrencies, and Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange platform. They say direct access to the Fed’s payment systems would allow them to more quickly and cheaply process orders from customers buying and selling digital assets. Currently they must partner with traditional banks that have accounts with the Fed.<br />Traditional banks say the newer financial firms are supervised relatively lightly and lack the internal controls needed to ensure against money laundering and other illicit activities—concerns that regulators have expressed about the crypto industry more broadly. And they say the firms are riskier because they aren’t insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.<br />“It is reasonable to expect that such applicants will pose heightened risks regarding matters of anti-money-laundering, cybersecurity and consumer protection, as well as safety and soundness,” the Bank Policy Institute, which represents large banks, and the Independent Community Bankers of America wrote in a letter to the Fed last month.<br />Avanti and Kraken, which both have “special purpose” bank charters in Wyoming, say they have all the same compliance, controls and supervisory requirements of traditional banks. The only U.S. bank regulator that has a supervisory exam manual for crypto is in Wyoming, they say.</td>

Its self-described mission is to become a more environmentally sustainable and scalable blockchain network, in part by relying less on energy-consuming cryptocurrency miners.<br />Ada is a digital token, or cryptocurrency. It runs on the Cardano blockchain. It is named for Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician who is often regarded as the first computer programmer.<br />In general, altcoins—or alternatives to bitcoin—have been surging lately as individual investors pile back into cryptocurrencies.

Chief Executive Scott Kirby, and Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Chief Executive John Dietrich raised concerns with federal officials about the problem this week, including Thursday in conversations with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and other officials, according to some of the people.<br />United has made its hangar at Dulles available as an area where passengers can wait to be processed, these people said. American Airlines is working to set up a space to accommodate people before clearance at Philadelphia International Airport, where flights will soon start arriving. Other locations including New York, Chicago and Houston have also been considered, the people said.<br />Some flights arriving this week have waited after landing for 10 to 12 hours for clearance from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, on top of already long flights from overseas. The problems continued with more extended waits overnight Thursday. The situation started to improve Friday, with passengers from three flights disembarking within two hours, industry and government officials said.</td>

      <td>A 6-3 Supreme Court tosses the President’s lawless eviction ban.</td>
      <td>President Biden told Democrats that the Supreme Court was likely to shoot down his two-month extension of a ban on rental evictions, and he was right. On Thursday night a 6-3 majority delivered a sharp legal rebuke to his abuse of executive power.<br />The Court’s eight-page unsigned opinion lifts a district court stay on its own injunction and makes unequivocally clear that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn’t come close to having legal authority to ban evictions. Landlords “not only have a substantial likelihood of success on the merits—it is difficult to imagine them losing,” the Court writes.<br />Justice Brett Kavanaugh in June joined Chief Justice John Roberts and the three liberals in maintaining the stay, but in a brief opinion said he agreed that the CDC had exceeded its authority. He wanted to give the President more time to distribute rental aid or for Congress to pass a law extending the ban.<br />Mr. Biden knew this but used the extension to buy time to deflect criticism from the left after a previous CDC extension expired July 31. While the Justices didn’t quote Mr. Biden, the forceful opinion makes clear they noticed how he abused their forbearance.<br />“The CDC has imposed a nationwide moratorium on evictions in reliance on a decades-old statute that authorizes it to implement measures like fumigation and pest extermination,” the Court explains. “It strains credulity to believe that this statute grants the CDC the sweeping authority that it asserts.” Under the government’s argument, there’s no limiting principle to CDC authority.</td>

      <td>Biden says the military, but the military says he gave them little choice.</td>
      <td>The terrorist threat to U.S. troops, civilians and Afghans continues to loom over the frantic evacuation of Kabul airport. Thursday’s suicide bombing, which killed 13 Americans and nearly 200 Afghans, has been claimed by an Islamic State affiliate, which is plotting more.<br />Why are American troops in such a difficult-to-defend position? The evacuation is taking place at an urban airport with a civilian wing, and perimeter security is being provided, unbelievably, by the Taliban. Only about 40 miles away is Bagram airfield, the military base that the U.S. vacated in the dead of night in July, without even warning America’s Afghan allies.<br />President Biden on Thursday essentially blamed his generals for the Bagram pullout. “They concluded—the military—that Bagram was not much value added, that it was much wiser to focus on Kabul,” he said. “And so, I followed that recommendation.” What Mr. Biden neglected to mention is that the President sets the constraints under which the military draws up plans and evaluates options.<br />At a briefing last week, General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that securing Bagram took “a significant level of military effort,” and “our task given to us at that time, our task was to protect the Embassy in order for the Embassy personnel to continue to function.” As a result, he added, “we had to collapse one or the other.”<br />When the decision was made, which was long before the Afghan government fell, the military thought using Kabul airport did not entail substantially higher risk. That option was judged, Gen. Milley said, “to be the better tactical solution in accordance with the mission set we were given and in accordance with getting the troops down to about 600, 700 number.”</td>

The classified version no doubt contains more details that may dribble out to the press in the coming days. But anyone expecting a smoking gun, even a BB gun, will be disappointed.<br />You’ll be glad to know the intelligence community, or IC, was able to nail down that the virus “probably emerged and infected humans” no later than November 2019. Is there evidence that it might have emerged sooner? That would be more interesting than the “no later” point, which we already knew.<br />Our spies also aver that the virus wasn’t developed as a biological weapon and that Chinese officials weren’t aware of the virus before the initial outbreak. But most agencies have only “low confidence” that the virus wasn’t genetically engineered. Two agencies, however, “believe there was not sufficient evidence to make an assessment either way.” So we really have no idea.</td>

      <td>President Biden’s climate plans could soon be advancing through the administrative state, and the place to watch is the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. This obscure outfit oversees America’s natural-gas pipelines and electricity markets, and Democrats are poised take control.<br />Since Mr. Biden’s inauguration, FERC has been operating with a holdover 3-2 Republican majority. That will change Monday, when GOP Commissioner Neil Chatterjee steps down. Although Mr. Chatterjee’s official term expired June 30, the rules let him stay on borrowed time. Mr. Biden hasn’t nominated his replacement, but the stakes are high, given what FERC might do next.<br />Even under GOP control, the past few months have been trying. At FERC’s acrimonious meeting in May, two minor natural-gas projects were nearly derailed by climate change. Northern Natural Gas wanted a new compressor station, along with some other odds and ends. Tuscarora Gas Transmission wanted to replace a compressor unit while doubling its power. Everyone agreed these were worthwhile projects, and they eventually passed 3-2.<br />But the two Democratic commissioners dissented, because the proposals didn’t come with environmental impact statements to evaluate their climate effects. What if a study predicted nontrivial emissions? This wouldn’t be “a death knell” for a project, the Democrats argued, since the developer could always offer ways “to mitigate those adverse impacts.”<br />This is a glimpse of the future: In February FERC put out a notice seeking “stakeholder perspectives” on ways to revise its approval process for new natural-gas projects. It specifically cited public interest in “how the Commission addresses climate change.” Building natural-gas lines in the future will probably involve more studies and green indulgences, assuming that the project isn’t killed outright.</td>

      <td>Kabul has fallen, Afghanistan is lost, but jihadism is far from finished with us. As the late scholar Bernard Lewis noted in 1990, the roots of Muslim rage run deep. Groups like the Taliban, al Qaeda, ISIS and now ISIS-K measure their grievance with the West in millennia, not decades. Our long war may be over. To them it was only a battle.<br />Bloodthirsty madmen don’t hate America because Americans were in Afghanistan—or Saudi Arabia or Lebanon. Fanatics never need an excuse. The U.S. military’s presence in the greater Middle East was merely a pretense. They hated us before all that, because we are allied to the Zionists, because in their eyes we are decadent and irreligious, and, above all, because our culture has left theirs in the dust. They hate us because of their failure to keep up. Our successes embarrass them.<br />Leaving Afghanistan hasn’t made us safer. Ten U.S. Marines, two soldiers, a sailor and nearly 200 desperate Afghans were killed outside Kabul’s airport on Wednesday by men motivated by the same evil that animated Mohamed Atta, the snake-eyed ringleader of 9/11. The troops who died were in Kabul on a humanitarian mission, to protect, to help our friends escape Taliban reprisals. They were murdered in cold blood, like the 193 slaughtered on Madrid commuter trains in 2004, the 165 murdered across four days in Mumbai in 2008, the 52 slain in London on July 7, 2005, the 89 concertgoers mowed down at the Bataclan Theater and the 12 cartoonists butchered at the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris in 2015.<br />That’s leaving aside the beheadings, the stabbings and the cars plowed into crowds during the past 30 years. Islamism’s butcher’s bill is long and bloody. They were trying to kill us before 9/11; they won’t give up now.<br />It may take months or even years, but al Qaeda, ISIS and all the others will figure out how to hit us again. They will kill and maim scores of ordinary blameless people in offices, schools, airports, train stations, restaurants, night clubs, theaters, homes. All that matters to the jihadists is that the bodies will be American—or British, French, Dutch, Indian. All that matters is that their victims are outside the house of Islam. Death will come suddenly and violently for no reason other than the apocalyptic nihilism of jihadism.</td>

      <td>The Taliban’s military victory in Afghanistan is only the start of the group’s problems. The new government will fail because the Taliban cannot be pragmatic and ideological at the same time. Efforts by the Afghan jihadist movement to strike a balance will be exploited by ISIS—a transnational jihadist movement—and other groups, imperiling regional and international security. When that happens, the U.S. and its allies will have to return to the war-torn nation.<br />ISIS, which has denounced the Taliban as a fake jihadist movement, aims to exploit the group’s internal tug-of-war between pragmatism and ideological commitment. The volatility is heightened by the mix of entities in Afghanistan, including ISIS, the Pakistani Taliban and al Qaeda. There is also a debate whether to build an emirate or a caliphate, with the Taliban pursuing an Islamic polity within Afghanistan while ISIS seeks a single state for the entire Muslim world.<br />The Taliban are trying to persuade the world that their Emirate 2.0 will be different from the 1990s version. Meantime, ISIS staged a deadly attack on Kabul’s airport Thursday, targeting the scene of the U.S.-led evacuation. Thirteen U.S. troops and nearly 200 Afghan civilians were killed.<br />Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar met Monday in Kabul with Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns. The CIA is taking a lead role in airlifting thousands of American citizens from the country. Separately, the Taliban’s chief spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, told the  New York Times  that Afghan women should stay at home until rank-and-file Taliban fighters have been trained not to mistreat them.<br />The two developments illustrate the Taliban’s conundrum as they try to govern a nation that has experienced 20 years of Western-led modernization. The Taliban need the world to provide financial assistance, which hinges on recognition of the new emirate’s leaders. Hence the feverish effort to convince the world that the Taliban are pragmatic, despite being a radical Islamist entity.</td>

Ms. Khan, now 32, made her name with a 2017 law-student article arguing that  Amazon  should be broken up because it should be broken up. Now she’s getting to put her urges to work, first with  Facebook ,  and we can already anticipate the results:<br />Unless a judge puts the case out of its misery, it will drag on for a decade; the technological and commercial issues will quickly become moot; only fixerdom will derive any real benefit, in the form of billings. And Ms. Khan will long since have departed to become a leading ornament of Washington’s antitrust bar, its least productive interest group. When you see a volunteer in yellow vest picking up trash by the roadside, think: That person is doing more for the commonweal than all the antitrust lawyers put together.<br />All this we can know because we’ve seen the movie before, thanks to previous generations’ struggles with  IBM  and then  Microsoft .<br />In 2003, under the auspices of the Brookings Institution, economists Clifford Winston and Robert Crandall went looking for evidence that antitrust enforcement benefited the public. They found none. And there’s been no revolution since that would alter this conclusion. Think back to the Justice Department’s pointless attempt to block  AT&T ’s  acquisition of Time Warner, which has since unraveled for its own reasons. The department’s case served to show only how a serious person, Trump appointee Makan Delrahim, can be reduced to saying inane things under the bureaucratic compulsions that drive antitrust today.</td>

      <td>As long as  Amazon  is going to be building department stores, it can perform a sentimental public service: bringing back to the American shopping experience a long-lost, lovely, lilting sound.<br />When the online retail giant’s new brick-and-mortar stores, as first reported by the Journal, go up, I hope someone in corporate management will, if only for the free-floating fun of it, recommend the return of the soft, almost subliminal chimes that were a part of grand department store palaces during their mid-20th-century glory days.<br />If you ever heard those chimes, you’ve never forgotten them. You had no idea where they were coming from or what they signified. You might be riding an escalator up from the men’s suit department on the second floor, and there the chimes would be: bells so quiet you could barely make them out, musical whispers you encountered nowhere else in town—the secret, sophisticated symphony of those stores.<br />The chimes were the opposite of intrusive, the antithesis of annoying. It was as though they were being created by a tuxedoed musician in a philharmonic orchestra, lightly touching a vibraphone with his padded mallet. They were aural tranquilizers; however boisterous the streets outside, the chimes told the customers: You are inside a place of elegance.<br />If the shoppers knew the truth behind the chimes, it might have deflated them. They were part of a system to summon store executives to the in-house telephone for messages. The chimes were coded—two short chimes followed by a single chime might signal the merchandising vice president, while three single chimes might perk the ears of the ladies’ shoe department manager. No one carried cellphones then, so managers couldn’t receive texts; to call their names over loudspeakers would have been unthinkably crass, beneath the dignity of such a store.</td>

The index gained 0.9% to its first close above 4500. In the bond market, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell to 1.311% after Mr. Powell’s speech, from 1.342% Thursday.<br />The rise of Covid-19 infections due to the Delta variant has complicated the economic outlook by creating renewed risk of a sharper economic slowdown at the very moment some officials were ready to reduce, or taper, the pace of monthly bond purchases.</td>

Equally important, this great 17th-century Dutch painter could capture the thrilling rush of excitement when a boat, under full sail, surges through rough waters with spray crashing over its bow. Whether one is a sailor or not, the idea of being at the helm of such a vessel, of controlling its course through skill and fortitude, conveys a sense of freedom and adventure, emotions that have been sorely absent during the pandemic. Van de Velde’s “Ships in a Stormy Sea” (1671-72) is an uplifting and positive image of man’s ability to work in concert with nature rather than having it overwhelm us with its primal energy. Strong contrasts of light and dark heighten the drama, most emphatically in the juxtaposition of the brilliantly lighted, tawny spritsail with the dark, billowing clouds looming behind it. But throughout, flowing rhythms connect these pictorial elements into an organic whole.</td>

Officials see those price pressures quickly abating next year, with the consumer-price index rising 2.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022, more than the 2.1% they expected in May, and reaching 2.3% in 2023.<br />Those updated projections are consistent with other independent forecasts, including from the Federal Reserve, and reflect the administration’s view that price pressures, while higher than expected earlier this year, are likely to fade over time, administration officials said Friday.<br />“We think this trajectory is very much consistent with the inflation outlook we’ve been discussing pretty much since we got here,” one official said on a call with reporters.<br />Recent data suggest inflation pressures may have started easing but remain elevated. Consumer prices rose 0.4% last month, lower than the prior month’s 0.5% gain, according to the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge. Compared with a year ago, overall prices rose 4.2%.</td>

Mr. Bennett said he presented an alternative plan to contain Israel’s adversary.<br />“The first goal is to stop Iran on its regional aggression and start rolling them back into the box,” he said. “And the second is to permanently keep Iran away from ever being able to break out the nuclear weapon.”<br />Mr. Bennett, 49 years old, came to power two months ago and has sought to pull back from the perception his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, sided with Republicans over Democrats in Washington.

      <td>As the senior civilian official at a U.S. Army brigade headquarters in Eastern Afghanistan in 2008-09, I had firsthand exposure to the misconceptions and strategic errors that characterized our military mission. In Tunku Varadarajan’s “The Weekend Interview with David Petraeus” (Aug. 21), Gen. Petraeus deftly overlooks the fact that he was one of the major architects of the debacle upon which he is reflecting.<br />In the foreword to the U.S. Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual (2006), Mr. Petraeus wrote, “Soldiers and Marines are expected to be nation builders as well as warriors. . . . They must be able to facilitate establishing local governance and the rule of law.” At the 2001 Bonn Conference, the international community embarked on a path to impose a Western-style constitution on Afghanistan, and then spent billions of dollars and many years building central-government institutions in a tribal society with a thousand-year tradition of resisting central authority. Nation-building efforts under these circumstances were doomed to fail.<br />The military spent hundreds of millions of dollars building roads, schools and other infrastructure. In those villages where U.S. largesse succeeded in building goodwill, the ties were to the U.S. military, not the Afghan government. Given the broad dependence on the U.S. and resistance to the alien institutions grafted onto traditional Afghan power structures, it could not have come as a surprise to anyone paying attention that when we departed as abruptly we did, Afghans would revert to their own methods of conflict resolution rather than wage a destructive war on behalf of an inept and corrupt government.<br />Jeremy Brenner<br />Silver Spring, Md.</td>

      <td>I take issue with the characterization that the war in Afghanistan is America’s longest war (“What Went Wrong in Afghanistan?” Review, Aug. 21). The U.S. decision to enter into conflict in Afghanistan was a result of the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the U.S. It wasn’t merely a war in or against Afghanistan but part of a larger conflict against terrorism. President George W. Bush described it as a “global war on terrorism.” The GWOT has many elements, including finding and killing terrorists in Syria, East Africa and elsewhere. Many believe this war will last for generations and may include repeated incursions into Afghanistan.<br />America’s real longest war was the conflict against Native Americans, called the American Indian Wars, which most historians characterize as beginning in 1609 and ending in 1924.<br />Finally, readers should never forget the Korean War. It began June 25, 1950, and has never ended. Yes, a cease-fire was signed July 27, 1953, but a state of conflict still exists on the Korean Peninsula. As a former lead U.S. negotiator with the North Korean Army at the demilitarized zone, I never doubted that we were engaged in a protracted war. Ask anyone who has ever been assigned to U.S. Forces Korea or their fellow servicemen who have as their primary mission to deploy in or near the Korean Peninsula in defense of the Republic of Korea.<br />Lt.

      <td>Judge says Gov. Ron DeSantis overstepped his authority and allows school districts to require students to wear masks</td>
      <td>A Florida judge said school districts could impose mask mandates and that Gov. Ron DeSantis had overstepped his authority when he banned such rules.<br />Judge John Cooper of the Second Judicial District in Tallahassee sided with parents of school children who had challenged a July executive order by Mr. DeSantis and a subsequent state rule that forbid school districts from implementing mask requirements that don’t allow parents to opt out their children.<br />In an oral ruling Friday, Judge Cooper said the defendants, including the governor and the state Department of Education, improperly sought to draw authority for their actions from a state law enacted earlier this year, dubbed the parents’ bill of rights, which aimed to protect parents’ ability to make decisions regarding their children’s education and health.<br />“The defendants do not have authority under this law to a blanket mandatory ban against a face mask policy that does not provide a parental opt out,” Judge Cooper said. “They simply do not.”<br />Under that law, school districts can enact policies such as mask mandates without seeking permission in advance from the state, as long as they are reasonable and serve a compelling state interest, the judge said.</td>

      <td>Electric-vehicle startup backed by Amazon and Ford has raised $10.5 billion since 2019</td>
      <td>Electric-vehicle startup Rivian Automotive said Friday that it has confidentially submitted paperwork with financial regulators for a proposed listing, joining a growing list of battery-electric upstarts looking to tap the public markets.<br />Rivian, whose backers include  Amazon.com Inc.  and  Ford Motor Co. , said the size and price range for the proposed public offering haven’t been determined. The company said it expects the initial public offering to happen after the Securities and Exchange Commission completes its review process. Bloomberg earlier reported the filing.<br />The startup has raised $10.5 billion since 2019, as investors have grown more enthusiastic about battery-electric technology. In filing for a traditional IPO, Rivian is taking a different path from many rival electric-vehicle startups, a number of which went public within the last year through mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs.<br />The Irvine, Calif.-based auto maker plans to start producing its first electric-pickup truck this year at a factory in Normal, Ill., followed by an SUV with branding aimed at outdoor enthusiasts.<br />It is one of a number of upstart car manufacturers vying with more traditional auto makers to dominate in electric vehicles, a technology that the Biden administration is promoting as a way to help combat climate change.</td>

      <td>Conventional grass is costly, high-maintenance and increasingly out of style. If you want to devote at least part of your yard to popular alternatives—and cut down on lawn care—here’s a guide.</td>
      <td>DAN FALVO and his wife, Nicole, nearly didn’t make an offer on their 1988 center-hall colonial in East Haddam, Conn., the 33rd property they had mulled. It came with an amenity Mr. Falvo found disenchanting: nearly 3 acres of lawn. “We pulled into here and the house was beautiful, but I saw the lawn and I went, ‘No. I don’t want to live on a golf course,’” said Mr. Falvo, a branch manager for a plumbing and HVAC firm. “The first time I mowed, it literally took me four hours on a sit-down mower.” Three years later, the couple swapped out most of their acre-plus front lawn for a meadow of wildflowers (shown above).<br />The Falvos are among the many homeowners who’ve decided to investigate green alternatives, deeming a perfect carpet of classic grass too taxing on such resources as time, water and money. Others don’t want to use chemical fertilizers and weedkillers and prefer to provide a habitat for more diverse fauna than a monoculture lawn supports. Since the pandemic began, for example, sales of one of the lawn proxies, Wildflower Farm’s Eco-Lawn, have more than doubled. A blend of five drought-tolerant fescues, the grass demands comparatively less maintenance, said Paul Jenkins, co-owner of the Coldwater, Ontario, company. “Most lawns that we deal with in North America are not adapted to North American conditions,” Mr. Jenkins said, and therefore need more care to flourish here. “Kentucky Blue [grass], you think that would be from Kentucky. It’s from Europe.”<br />Of course, there’s nothing wrong with loving your swath of conventional grass. “Lawns can serve an important social function and are one of the few plant communities that you can walk on, that you can play on,” said Peter Del Tredici, senior research scientist emeritus at Harvard University’s Arnold Arboretum, in Boston. Even ecological landscape designer Jodie Cook, in San Clemente, Calif., admires the classic green, though in her area she would recommend low-water UC Verde Buffalograss: “For us, there’s nothing like a lawn but a lawn.”<br />But what if you don’t have a croquet addiction or a gaggle of roughhousing children, and you’d like to ease into the alternative-lawn culture? Perhaps you’re game for experimenting with some of your yard, while preserving a portion as traditional turf, as Ms. Cook advises. Where do you begin?<br />If you’re weighing a change, autumn is a prime season to undertake one of the following options. Mr. Del Tredici advised visiting your local garden center to determine what species have the best chance in your area; what thrives in one zone might shrivel in another. Consider starting with a pilot plot to gauge how your choice pans out. To get your green gears turning, here are a few stories of success—inspiring approaches that call for various levels of commitment.</td>

      <td>Thursday’s attacks were a reminder that ‘the enemy always gets a vote.’ With the Afghanistan pullout, the long war against jihadists has become more daunting.</td>
      <td>President Biden, like his two immediate predecessors, seems to think you can end “forever wars” simply by leaving them. But Thursday’s unprovoked attack, on people who were fleeing and those who were helping them, demonstrates the truth of the soldier’s adage that “the enemy always gets a vote.”<br />On the day Kabul fell to the Taliban, the president declared that he wouldn’t ask “our troops to fight on endlessly in another country’s civil war, taking casualties, suffering life-shattering injuries, leaving families broken by grief and loss. This is not in our national-security interest. It is not what the American people want.”<br />The appeal is easy to understand. Even as a civilian, I’ve seen enough of those life-shattering injuries, enough of the grief and loss of Gold Star families, to know that I don’t want it to continue for one day more than necessary.<br />But what is necessary? Those who complain of “forever wars” seem to ignore the reason we were in Afghanistan in the first place, or they misstate it, as Mr. Biden did in this instance. We were never in Afghanistan to participate in its civil war. We went there to prevent a murderous gang from regaining control of Afghanistan, where they ruled 20 years ago and where they enabled an attack that killed nearly 3,000 people on American soil.<br />The war with that gang and its affiliates won’t end because the U.S. has quit. Nothing we know about the Taliban, much less anything that we have seen in the last month, suggests that they are ready to quit. Thursday’s bombings appear to have been the work of a rival gang, ISIS-K. Mr. Biden called it “an archenemy of the Taliban,” but the two groups both hate the U.S. and believe it’s glorious to kill Americans. It’s a shame they can’t both lose, as someone said in a different context—but whoever wins will make Afghanistan a haven for anti-American terrorists.</td>

      <td>Conway, Ark.<br />I lost track of the number of “Help Wanted” signs in the windows of businesses in my hometown. When I started counting in the spring, it seemed every other establishment I passed was looking to hire. It was a topic of conversation everywhere I went in Conway, a city of 65,000 about 30 miles north of Little Rock. Businesses were ready to reopen fully, but they struggled to find employees.<br />Four months later, things are starting to change. The signs are coming down. Businesses are extending hours, and the local economy is picking up steam. I don’t only see it; I hear it in conversations with friends and small-business owners.<br />What explains the turnaround? In May, Gov. Asa Hutchinson decided to opt Arkansas out of the extra $300 in weekly unemployment benefits the federal government is offering. Before the announcement, Arkansas was still down 32,000 jobs compared with February 2020. Considering the recession had officially ended more than a year earlier, in April 2020, something was clearly blocking the recovery.<br />According to research published by the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Institute, because of the supplemental $300 a week, 48% of American workers made at least as much in unemployment benefits during the pandemic as they did while working. At the start of May, the number of people collecting unemployment in Arkansas was still nearly twice as high as it was before the pandemic started—yet at the same time, the state’s employers had a record 80,000 job openings.</td>

      <td>Despite uncertainties, investors should be prepared for firm commitment to tapering by November</td>
      <td>There is a very good chance that in the final analysis, the Delta variant won’t have done much to hinder the economy. Instead, rising vaccination rates, the availability of boosters and the eventual approval of vaccines for younger children may lead to things only getting better. And if that happens, it would probably be better for the Federal Reserve to have begun reducing its bond purchases, giving itself at least the option of raising rates.<br />But for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, sending a message committing the bank to tapering bond purchases—in a speech on Friday that up until a week ago was expected to be given at in person at Jackson Hole, Wyo., but was given remotely instead because of Delta concerns—would have been an odd thing to do. And so he didn’t.<br />Rather, he noted that the economy has exhibited continued strength since the Fed’s July meeting, where he and other policy makers reckoned it would make sense to start tapering by year-end, but that the Delta variant’s spread had also worsened.<br />Friday brought more news on those fronts. The Commerce Department reported that consumer spending rose 0.3% in July from June, buoyed by gains in spending on services, with notable gains in categories such as air transportation, hotel stays and live entertainment. The report also showed that the Commerce Department’s measure of consumer prices—the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge—was up 4.2% from a year earlier. Core prices, which exclude food and energy items, were up 3.6%. While some of those price gains are likely transitory, inflation that far above the 2% level that the Fed is targeting is surely notable.<br />But it is clear that things haven’t been so buoyant this month. The University of Michigan on Friday said that its final reading on consumer sentiment in August was down sharply from July. The Kansas City Fed reported that its measure of service-sector activity in its district slowed in August from July, with 22% of the firms it surveyed saying the rise in Covid-19 cases had reduced business.</td>

Or it could just be that they are itchy.<br />Delta’s new uniforms, designed by Zac Posen and manufactured by Lands’ End, were launched to great fanfare three years ago in colors including “Passport Plum.” But many employees wanted to leave the former “Project Runway” judge’s duds on the tarmac. There have been numerous complaints about skin rashes and of colors bleeding onto other garments. The airline has allowed its flight attendants to wear their own clothing along with badges indicating they are employees, and it said last year that it would redesign the uniforms.<br />But some current and former employees wanted more, seeking to launch a class-action suit against the manufacturer (the designer, Mr. Posen, shut down his business in 2019). The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin last week refused to grant certification to the group.

      <td>Nico’s beauty captivated admirers and directors. But her songs are best heard in the dark.</td>
      <td>Nico was a face before she was a force. As a striking young fashion model in 1959 working in Rome, she visited the set where Federico Fellini was filming his latest project. When the great director spotted her, he exclaimed “I have dreamt of you. I recognize your face.” No further audition was necessary: Nico was cast in “La Dolce Vita.”<br />The part was small, a few smoldering scenes. The impact was large. As Jennifer Otter Bickerdike points out in “You Are Beautiful and You Are Alone,” her definitive biography of Nico, for years until her death from a cerebral hemorrhage in 1988, fans would buttonhole Nico about the film and how they fell hard for the mysterious tall blonde with the sunken cheekbones.<br />It was ever thus for the former Christa Päffgen, so arrestingly beautiful that she could command a stage by standing there. This was the blessing and the curse of Nico’s life: Her face opened doors for her, but also occluded her artistic achievements—a series of flashpoints followed by long periods of drug dependency, poverty and itinerant living. In order to string those moments together, Ms. Bickerdike, a pop-music scholar who has written books on Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain and Joy Division’s Ian Curtis, digs deeper than any prior biographer. She unearths a unique artistic temperament stunted by the complications of an underground life.<br />Today, most of us know Nico for one indelible moment: her vocal contributions to “The Velvet Underground & Nico” (1967), a landmark record that introduced subversive content into popular music. Nico was conscripted into the Velvets as a “beautiful mannequin” by the impresario Andy Warhol for a series of multimedia happenings he called the Exploding Plastic Inevitable. The Velvets’ leader, Lou Reed, had no use for her.<br />At Warhol’s bidding, Reed reluctantly gave Nico three lead vocals on the band’s debut album; she never recorded with them again. From the start, Nico’s talents were dismissed as dilettantish, a fashion model slumming it as a performer. The joke was on Reed: Her contributions to “The Velvet Underground & Nico” infused compositions like “All Tomorrow’s Parties” and “I’ll Be Your Mirror” with a chilliness and intimacy that radically elevated Reed’s lyrics.</td>

      <td>Doctors say insurers’ reluctance to pay for the controversial medication, Aduhelm, results in patients being put on waiting lists</td>
      <td>When Biogen Inc.’s Aduhelm was approved in June, patient advocates hailed the first new Alzheimer’s disease drug in nearly two decades. But health-policy analysts warned that the costly medication would add tens of billions of dollars to Medicare spending even if it were prescribed to just a fraction of people with the memory-loss disease.<br />Three months later, Aduhelm’s launch has made more of a whisper than a bang. Few patients are being treated with Aduhelm, doctors say, because health insurers are reluctant to pay for a medicine whose effectiveness is hotly disputed among doctors.<br />Many Alzheimer’s clinics are holding off on prescribing Aduhelm until federal officials decide next year if Medicare will pay for it. Hospitals that do provide the medication often require patients to cover its cost if their insurance refuses to pay; those who can’t are often put on waiting lists.<br />“Because of the uncertainty, it puts us in limbo,” said Stephen Salloway, director of Butler Hospital’s Memory and Aging Program in Providence, R.I. “The main issue right now is coverage.”<br />Patients from around the country have been referred to his clinic by doctors whose hospitals aren’t yet providing Aduhelm. Next week, Butler will treat its 10th patient with Aduhelm, Dr. Salloway said, but more than 100 patients have opted to be placed on a waiting list.</td>

He bought his own pool cue and wielded it expertly to win money at local billiards halls.<br />Pool hustling provided seed capital for a small concrete-pouring and construction business he created to help pay for his education at Long Island University, where he majored in industrial management.<br />That led to a management career at General Electric Co., Emerson Electric Co. and Black & Decker Corp., where he revitalized the power-tool business in the late 1980s. Mr. Sherman got his chance to be chief executive of a large company when Danaher Corp., founded by brothers Steven and Mitchell Rales, recruited him in 1990.<br />Mr. Sherman focused what had been a motley group of manufacturing businesses into a more streamlined maker of environmental controls, Craftsman tools and other products. During his 11 years as CEO, Danaher’s market value soared to more than 20 times the 1990 level.<br />Mr. Sherman funded educational programs in Baltimore, exercised daily and was known for his high energy. “Relaxing with George was exhausting,” a close friend recalled. He died Aug. 17, at the age of 80, of complications from a brain injury suffered 14 months earlier when he fell after his daily Peloton-stationary-bike workout.</td>

      <td>A new generation of regulators inspired by Louis Brandeis hopes to overturn the light-touch approach to antitrust shaped by Robert Bork.</td>
      <td>In 2018, a young legal scholar named Lina Khan published an essay in the Journal of European Competition Law & Practice titled “The New Brandeis Movement: America’s Antimonopoly Debate.” She defined the core beliefs of an inchoate alliance of scholars, lawyers, activists and journalists seeking to upend a four-decade-long consensus of light-touch antitrust enforcement. Their hope was to replace it with the century-old, tough-on-big-business spirit of Louis Brandeis, the Progressive Era crusader turned Supreme Court Justice. Near the end of the article, Ms. Khan observed: “To what degree this intellectual movement influences the U.S. competition regime in the coming years is an open question.”<br />Today, the answer is clearer than the upstarts could have imagined. They now find themselves at the center of the debate. Ms. Khan, 32, is the new head of one of Washington’s two antitrust enforcement arms, the Federal Trade Commission that Brandeis helped to create in 1914. President Biden has nominated another neo-Brandeisian, Jonathan Kanter, 48, to head the other key enforcer, the Justice Department’s antitrust division. White House competition policy is handled by Tim Wu, 49, who wrote a 2018 book advocating a Brandeis restoration.<br />They still face an uphill battle to enact their agenda, but it’s a remarkable advance for a movement that didn’t even have a name a few years ago. It underscores Mr. Biden’s intention, as he puts it, to “change the paradigm” in economic policy, repudiating the records not only of recent Republican presidents but of Democrats as well. Just as Donald Trump ripped up decades of bipartisan consensus on trade and globalization, Mr. Biden has assembled a team attempting to transform how the federal government deals with big business. In siding with the neo-Brandeisians, he has passed over experienced Democratic antitrust experts who cast the new ideology as a reckless experiment that, as one Clinton-Obama veteran says, “will slow economic growth and harm consumers.”<br />Much of what animates the New Brandeis movement is the rise of big tech. Its advocates believe that the dominant, winner-take-all platforms of Google,  Amazon ,   Facebook  and Apple are reminiscent of the interlocking, network-like behemoths that fostered the original antitrust movement: the railroads, the banks, Standard Oil and  U.S. Steel .  To Ms. Khan and her colleagues, the threat posed by the new giants requires dusting off old trust-busting strategies. If the neo-Brandeisians get their way, the federal government would challenge more mergers and business tactics and break up more companies.<br />But the shift is about more than big tech and tougher enforcement. It’s about a change in the underlying philosophy of how Washington has governed corporate America since the 1980s. The new framework is more rooted in social and political goals than economic ones; more focused on the size of companies per se, less on trying to assess whether that size is good or bad for the economy; and more sympathetic to suppliers, small business and workers, even at the expense of consumers.</td>

The company late Thursday said it expected more muted growth in the coming year.<br />The Consumer Product Safety Commission earlier this year warned people with pets or children to cease using the company’s treadmills after it investigated a child dying from being pulled under one of them. Peloton initially pushed back against the regulator, but later apologized and agreed to recall its treadmills.</td>

      <td>In a new work of science fiction for young readers, a utopian collective wants to erase the past.</td>
      <td>History abounds with homicidal utopians who believe that by extirpating tradition and reconfiguring society, they can bring about a better, purer world. In a clever and compelling novel, Donna Barba Higuera moves this misbegotten impulse to deep space in “The Last Cuentista.”<br />As a comet hurtles toward Earth, selected emigrants hasten aboard waiting starships. Some will spend their lives helping get the transports to a distant planet. Others, such as 13-year-old Petra Pena and her family, are to be preserved in machines so that when the ships land, they can reconstitute civilization with their memories intact. While in stasis, they will also download vast quantities of technical know-how.<br />As the ships depart, from her pod Petra hears an ominous conversation about a “change in the mission” but also, to her joy, the news that her programmer plans to fill her brain with a library’s worth of myths, legends and folk tales. She has always wanted to become a storyteller, a cuentista, like her grandmother rather than follow her parents into science.<br />Toggling back and forth in time, Ms. Higuera fuels the reader’s alarm as Petra wakes, centuries later, to find her family gone, the ship starkly altered and herself renamed Zeta-1. Egalitarian fanatics calling themselves “The Collective” have purged dissenters and brainwashed those who remain: “Not being tethered to tradition allows us to be logical,” says a functionary. Petra is the only person who remembers any of the old ways and stories. It is knowledge that both puts her in peril and makes her wonderfully subversive in this brainy adventure for readers ages 13 and older.<br />We see the urge to discredit and remove old stories in our own culture, of course. Bengal-born writer Mitali Perkins mounts a qualified defense of seven classic novels in “Steeped in Stories,” a book for adult readers with an interest in children’s literature. “We should be on the hunt for virtue as well as bias,” she writes in exploring how “The Hobbit,” “Heidi” and “Anne of Green Gables,” among others, can impart cardinal and theological virtues even if they manifest (or their authors held) ideas now considered retrograde.</td>

      <td>The novels of Nobel laureate Thomas Mann were read world-wide and he became an outspoken foe of Nazism. Yet his inner self remains elusive.</td>
      <td>Can a novel about historical figures make them visible in ways that a biography cannot? Colm Tóibín is hardly the first novelist to explore this question, but he is one of the more powerful, and perhaps the most determined. His 2004 novel “The Master” was an ardent improvisation on the life of the American writer Henry James. With “The Magician,” he offers an even more ambitious fictional portrait of the great 20th-century German novelist Thomas Mann.<br />“The Master” imagined four years in Henry James’s life during the last exhalations of the 19th century, when James was in his robust mid-50s, and ranged through James’s memories of his past in the northeastern United States, France, Italy and England. Throughout the book Mr. Tóibín made creative suppositions about the events and emotions that could have inspired James’s masterworks, including “The Beast in the Jungle” and “The Turn of the Screw.” What emerged in “The Master” was not a depiction of James that one would find in the many biographies about him. It is not my own idea of James, or most likely yours. Mr. Tóibín was less concerned with telling a literal story than with weaving an imagined interior life of James around and through a framework of biographical details. The result was pure fiction that nonetheless radiated with vitality, a formula that James himself would have approved.<br />In counterpoint to James’s famously opulent sentences, Mr. Tóibín wields a dramatically stripped-down prose style, one that emphasizes silence and stillness as much as dialogue and action. Its effect is cumulative, and its epiphanies, when they come, are all the more powerful after so much restraint. Mr. Tóibín, who was born in 1955 in County Wexford, Ireland, has written plenty of fiction set in his home country, in addition to novels that take place in Argentina, Spain and the U.S. He has been vocal in his opposition to stereotypes about the alleged Irish gift for storytelling, which he views as a patronizing idea that English people invented about Irish writers.<br />The author’s aggressively plain use of language is a bid to communicate something deeper and stronger than mere declaration. “I have no interest in Realism,” he told an Italian interviewer in 2012. “I am interested in rhythm. . . . I am talking about something which is much closer to the poetic . . . something beneath the sentences, or around them.” A comparison with the visual arts might help to clarify. In the same way that Ernest Hemingway looked for a new way to write by gazing at the paintings of Paul Cézanne, Mr. Tóibín seeks to deploy language, as he has explained, “which has a sort of shiver of movement; it’s almost like a Velázquez composition, where it’s not photo-realism, it’s filled with paint and the mystery of paint.”<br />Those shivers of movement, which were relatively subdued in “The Master,” become convulsions in “The Magician,” whose central figure Mr. Tóibín presents as an internationally famous literary figure wracked by near-constant public and private turmoil. (The title refers to the nickname Thomas Mann’s six children gave him, because he entertained them with simple magic tricks and once dressed as a wizard for a costume party.) When Mann won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1929, at age 54, he confessed in his acceptance speech that the award had thrown him into a “marvelous confusion.” “My disposition and my desires call for peace to spin my thread,” he said, “a steady rhythm in life and art.” Yet his was a life unrelieved by peace or steadiness. The death of Mann’s father in 1891, when Mann was 16, forced the liquidation of the family’s lucrative grain-importing business and the sale of its large home in the city of Lübeck in northern Germany. “The time of his family was over,” Mr. Tóibín writes.</td>

      <td>Can the partnership born on a maritime U.S.-U.K. summit still protect democracy?</td>
      <td>It was, even for those two historical giants, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill, a remarkable action. On Aug. 7, 1941, without letting the still-neutral American nation know what was going on, the unorthodox and purposeful president had arrived in the quiet harbor of Placentia Bay on the Newfoundland coast, after traveling there via train and warship. Two days later the equally resourceful Prime Minister of Britain arrived in the same port on the battleship HMS Prince of Wales, just repaired from its encounter with the Bismarck.<br />For three full days, these two leaders and their top advisers shared their views about how the United States and the British Empire should carry out a combined policy against the Axis powers “in the event” of America’s joining the war. This meeting turned out to be the first of 11 that the “Big Two” would have during the world conflict—the last being with Stalin, at Yalta in February 1945. Their colloquy established a pattern for the hammering-out of the shared Anglo-American grand strategy.<br />In addition to discussing their military intentions, the two governments also worked together to produce one of the most important political documents in the West’s canon of statements about human rights, trade, the freedom of peoples and democratic purpose. The statement, soon termed “The Atlantic Charter” in the press, was issued after the two leaders had secretly departed for home, the better to avoid possible enemy interruption.<br />The Atlantic Charter was never actually signed by Roosevelt and Churchill, but was later viewed by historians as a grand step toward the coming of the United Nations. The lineage of the document’s ideas ran back, via Wilson’s Fourteen Points, to 19th-century thought about the comity of nations and an international order. And when this greatest conflict in human history was over—to be followed shortly after by the rise of the Cold War—the permanent peacetime agreements that formed the NATO alliance (1949) could also be seen as the natural successor to the ideas and decisions that arose from Roosevelt and Churchill’s meeting.<br />It is not surprising, then, that whenever the cohesiveness and common purposes of the Western Alliance appears to be splintering, whenever America and Europe seem to be drifting apart in today’s world, the calls to halt that danger almost always begin by referring back to this historic 1941 encounter. A fine new Brookings Institution policy book by David McKean and Bart Szewczyk, “Partners of First Resort: America, Europe and the Future of the West,” is not a work of history, unless one thinks of it being what scholars at the Harvard Kennedy School call “Applied History.” The two authors are scholar-practitioners (both being former members of the Policy Planning Staff of the Department of State) and their account begins with the Atlantic Charter, the United Nation and NATO, then gallops forward swiftly to the coming of the Obama and Trump presidencies, both of which in their different ways (the latter especially) exposed irresolution and fissures in the Atlantic partnership.</td>

He said the company’s lax security eased his path into a cache of  T-Mobile  records. “Their security is awful,” Mr. Binns told the Journal.<br />It wasn’t immediately clear whether Mr. Binns worked alone or with help.

      <td>It can be awkward to deliver a rejection, but job applicants and potential dates deserve the courtesy of certainty.</td>
      <td>Hate wondering and waiting? We all do. That’s why it’s important to let people in your personal and professional life know when to expect to hear from you, and also to say what you mean, clearly and kindly, even when it isn’t what they want to hear. As a clinical psychologist, I’ve seen that many people find the prospect of disappointing someone so cringeworthy that they prefer to skip a potentially awkward exchange and just disappear—a practice popularly known as “ghosting.”<br />A 2021 survey of 500 job seekers and 500 employers by the employment website Indeed found that 77% of candidates had experienced ghosting from prospective employers, while 28% of candidates acknowledged doing the ghosting themselves. When it comes to personal relationships, a survey of more than 500 people published in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships in 2018 found that 25% of respondents had been ghosted by someone they were dating, and 38% by a friend.<br />Though my clients often find it uncomfortable to deliver bad news, I encourage them to offer others the courtesy of certainty. Studies show that being left hanging or obsessing over mixed messages—when someone gives you reason to hope, then pulls away, known as “breadcrumbing”—decreases life satisfaction and fuels loneliness more profoundly than disappearing completely. Your job as a compassionate human being is to “Give people predictability,” explains Dr. Robert Sutton, who teaches organizational behavior at Stanford Graduate School of Business and is the author of “The No Asshole Rule: Building a Civilized Workplace and Surviving One That Isn’t.”<br />When someone we know morphs from attentive to aloof without explanation, it’s disconcerting and maddening. In a famous experiment in the 1970s, psychologist Edward Tronick of the University of Massachusetts Boston studied what happens when mothers warmly engage with their babies and then suddenly withdraw. The children became palpably distraught, illustrating how human beings innately crave validation. Whatever your age, it’s normal to want responsiveness.<br />That’s why learning to say no with kindness is something we all need to practice. Though you don’t need to formally break up with someone after one meeting or reply to every message you receive on LinkedIn, “If someone you’ve engaged with contacts you, you have to respond,” says Dr. Guy Winch, a clinical psychologist and co-host of the podcast “Dear Therapists.” While at times you can’t help having to disappoint someone, reaching out promptly and offering compassion eases the sting.</td>

      <td>Terms like ‘grass-fed’ and ‘pasture-raised’ sell a lot of steaks. But do you really know where your meat is coming from? Here, an explainer.</td>
      <td>BACK IN MAY, Belcampo Meat Co., which touts a supply chain with “total transparency from start to finish,” was alleged by a former employee at its Santa Monica butcher shop to have passed off corn-fed meat as grass-fed, imported meat as local, and meat from other sources as its own. Belcampo admitted to an “isolated incident” of mislabeling, citing pandemic-related supply-chain issues. “We took action the day we became aware of the restaurant sourcing issue and have not purchased any meat externally since then, instead sourcing all meat through the Belcampo internal supply chain with labeling and oversight provided by a number of regulatory agencies,” said Belcampo CEO Garry Embleton.<br />Still, the incident left consumers uneasy. “Butchers are always fighting against a history of dishonest practices, like putting their fingers on the scale,” said J. Fox, butcher and co-owner of the Hudson & Charles butcher shops in New York City. “And now we are fighting against this greenwashing. You can’t blame customers for feeling like everyone is lying to them.”<br />So, how to know your butcher is honest? “Do your due diligence,” said Bryan Mayer, executive director of the Butcher’s Guild. “People put more effort into buying a TV than they do with their food.” But it can be challenging to keep up with an industry where there’s little regulation regarding transparency. Here, Mr. Mayer, Mr. Fox and Hudson & Charles butcher/co-owner Kevin Haverty offer tips on how consumers can best find out if they are getting what they are paying for.<br />If you are concerned about whether your beef is grass-fed—especially if you have a corn or soy allergy—look for “100% grass-fed” in the case or on the label. If the label simply says “grass-fed” or “grass-finished,” it can mean the animal was fed grass only for part of its lifetime. Even if a label claims “100%,” Mr. Fox recommended going a step further and asking, “Who are your farmers?” In his view, “It’s a good telltale that someone’s not being honest with you if they can’t answer that simple question.” Then, call the farmers, not only to verify their practices but also to verify that they do indeed do business with your butcher. If a butcher is not forthcoming about their farmers, consumers should question their claims on everything.<br />A whole-animal butcher buys the entire animal and breaks it down, using as much of it as possible, from nose to tail, instead of sourcing “packaged” cuts from distributors. With a whole-animal butcher, it is easier to confirm where the meat comes from. A good way to tell if a butcher is indeed whole-animal is to look for variety in the case. “If a butcher has trays and trays of skirt steaks or hanger steaks, for example, think about how there are only two skirt steaks and one hanger steak per animal,” Mr. Fox said. Does there appear to be an endless supply of popular cuts, like rib-eye? “We sell out of rib-eyes in two days. The whole-animal business model is to run out of things,” he added.</td>

      <td>China’s government is slow-rolling approval of its first foreign Covid-19 vaccine out of concern it could undermine confidence in Chinese vaccines, delivering further evidence of the tenacity of vaccine nationalism in the face of a resurgent pandemic.<br />Chinese health authorities worry that public doubts about Chinese vaccines stemming from approval of Germany’s  BioNTech SE ’s  vaccine could disrupt the country’s plans to use the homegrown shots to reach an ambitious vaccination goal before the end of the year, according to people familiar with the deliberations.<br />China was expected to approve the BioNTech vaccine, which is based on state-of-the-art mRNA technology, by July. While Chinese vaccines, made with traditional methods, have proven effective at preventing hospitalizations, Chinese public-health experts had pushed for the introduction of Western vaccines that have proven more effective in clinical studies.<br />Uncertainty about how much more protection the BioNTech vaccine offers against new variants is also driving the hesitation, the people said.<br />Clinical trials conducted earlier in the pandemic show BioNTech’s vaccine is around 95% effective against symptomatic disease, compared with 51% for Sinovac BioTech Ltd. and 79% for Sinopharm. The Delta variant cuts BioNTech’s efficacy down to 64%, according to data from Israel, while there is little data about how well the Chinese vaccines protect against the new variant.</td>
