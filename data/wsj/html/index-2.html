      <td>The Flint lead-water indictments look worse all the time.</td>
      <td>Some politicians seem to want to lock up their opponents more than they do criminals. Consider the tainted prosecution of former Michigan GOP Gov. Rick Snyder and his associates over the city of Flint’s lead-water contamination.<br />A state judge last month ordered state Solicitor General Fadwa Hammoud to establish an independent “taint team” to review some 21 million documents her office seized to investigate Mr. Snyder and eight other public officials involving Flint. Many documents are protected by attorney-client privilege, so prosecutors and the grand jury should never have laid eyes on them.</td>

      <td>When President Biden’s public utterances make the news, it’s sometimes hard to tell whether he’s signaling a substantive shift or merely wandering off message. On a call with governors Monday to discuss the Covid-19 pandemic, this is how Mr. Biden started his remarks: “There is no federal solution. This gets solved at the state level.”<br />Oh? During the 2020 presidential campaign, Mr. Biden pledged “to shut down the virus, not the country.” He also slammed President Trump in a debate, saying: “Anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as President of the United States of America.” Mr. Biden’s policies have followed that approach, as when his Education Department inserted itself into state and local debates over school mask policies.</td>

Last week the General Assembly signed off on a multimillion dollar sinecure for a permanent “Commission of Inquiry” into its most hated member.<br />The U.N.’s Human Rights Council resolved in May to “investigate violations of international humanitarian law” in the wake of the 11-day Gaza war between Israel and Hamas. The conscientious proponent of the resolution was Pakistan—last seen supporting the Taliban’s Afghanistan takeover—with human-rights champions China and Cuba also voting yes.</td>

At issue are due process and the political accountability of the judiciary.<br />State lawmakers learned this year that Montana judges had opined on proposed legislation in response to a survey of their views from Court Administrator Beth McLaughlin. Lawmakers worried that this compromised the impartiality of judges who may hear cases challenging the legality of new legislation. But when lawmakers asked to see the correspondence, Ms. McLaughlin said the emails no longer existed. Lawmakers tried to retrieve them from the Department of Administration, which houses state email archives.</td>

      <td>Despite years of warning, the U.S. and its allies aren’t ready for the challenges created by a coterie of Eurasian autocrats. The habits of mind prevalent among democratic peoples and their leaders have left us vulnerable more than once, and thus bear some examination. The principal error is thinking that men like Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Ali Khamenei want what most Westerners want. They don’t.<br />The most immediate threat is that Mr. Putin will invade Ukraine or engage in related forms of reckless mischief. As during Mr. Putin’s seizure of Crimea in 2014, there is a sense of incredulity at his audacity, as well as confusion about his intentions. An unnamed senior administration official told reporters on Dec. 17: “The Russian people don’t need a war with Ukraine. They don’t need their sons coming home in body bags. They don’t need another foreign adventure. What they need is better healthcare, build back better, roads, schools, economic opportunity.”</td>

      <td>How to sell shares and avoid benefiting from insider information? In equal sums every day.</td>
      <td>Mark Zuckerberg has been criticized by privacy advocates, parents critical of social media, and politicians on Capitol Hill. But in one respect, the  Meta Platforms  CEO is the model executive. Mr. Zuckerberg trades shares in his company each trading day, ensuring that his diversification is done randomly and avoiding any possibility that he benefits from insider information. More executives should follow his lead, and the Securities and Exchange Commission might be smart to mandate they do.<br />The problem starts with CEO pay. It isn’t the canard that it is “excessive,” but a conundrum arises because CEOs are compensated primarily with company stock. This idea—a product of the early 1990s—revolutionized American corporations. By aligning the interests of CEOs and shareholders, equity pay reduced the temptation to build empires and focused corporate managers on creating value for shareholders.</td>

Yet if there is a hopeful story to emerge anywhere from this year’s Afghan calamity, it might be here in the Western Balkans—a region that a generation ago was hemorrhaging refugees but that stepped forward last summer as an unexpected haven for those fleeing the Taliban. Leading the charge has been Edi Rama, Albania’s prime minister. Even before the fall of Kabul, Mr. Rama made the extraordinary decision to offer temporary sanctuary to at-risk Afghans with nowhere else to turn.</td>

      <td>He barged into history delivering ﬁery speeches against the king. He was manipulative and bloodthirsty but essential to modern pluralism.</td>
      <td>Great political leaders, with a tiny number of exceptions, are complicated people who possess both appalling flaws and magnificent virtues. Oliver Cromwell was not one of those exceptions. He sought and relished the demise of political enemies, hogged glory for military feats rightly belonging to others, perpetrated wartime atrocities, and equated God’s will with his own intentions. But he also undermined a class system that elevated birth over ability, dealt a death blow to the divine-right monarchy, and forced the English nation to reckon with the reality of religious—and, by extension, political—diversity. “He was,” Ronald Hutton writes in “The Making of Oliver Cromwell,” “courageous, devout, resolute, principled, intelligent, eloquent, able, adaptable and dedicated, but also self-seeking, unscrupulous, dishonest, manipulative, vindictive and bloodthirsty: definitely not somebody to be taken simply at his word.”<br />Mr. Hutton, a history professor at Bristol University, covers only Cromwell’s elevation to national fame: from his birth in 1599 to the end of the first English Civil War, when the parliamentarians destroyed the last forces of Charles I at the battles of Naseby and Langport in 1645. By that year Cromwell—who had no formal military training—had become a highly effective cavalry commander and lieutenant-general of the parliamentary army. He would go on to command the army in a string of decisive victories and rule the nation as Lord Protector. Mr. Hutton aims to give a clearer picture of this remarkable man’s origins and political rise.</td>

That number is notable not just because of the degree to which it dwarfs recent top sellers in the format—Harry Styles’s “Fine Line,” the bestselling vinyl LP of 2020, moved about 232,000 units—but also because of the well-publicized production problems at pressing plants. Independent artists with nowhere near Adele’s industry muscle have described delays of a year or more in getting physical copies of their albums made. Demand for vinyl LPs far outstrips supply, which is one of several markers that suggest the album as a music format is still very much alive—and will continue to endure into the future.</td>

If you’re crazy about Hondas but don’t think the government should force everyone to buy a Honda, are you “anti-Honda”?<br />The people at Merriam-Webster are blurring the distinction between choice and coercion, and that’s not merely semantics.

      <td>Demand shifts contribute to the chaos, but are far down in the list of causes.</td>
      <td>Explaining the supply-chain crisis is like a blind man describing an elephant. It depends on where you grope. Drawing conclusions from a single point of contact can be misleading.<br />“An Insider Explains The Supply-Chain Crisis” by Tunku Varadarajan (Weekend Interview, Dec. 18) makes the reasonable point that shifts in consumer behavior contribute to the crisis. But demand for new ovens or toilet paper isn’t changing only because of the crisis. While timing and mix of demand will vary, the pandemic-related delays are caused by how disruptions affect the internal workings of the supply chain. The tanker stuck in the Suez Canal had a more consequential effect than the 4% shift of demand to services. Companies’ response to the crisis determine its duration and severity.</td>

      <td>In addition to the concerns you address in “The Supreme Court’s Covid Vaccine Test” (Review & Outlook, Dec. 21), it is alarming that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit gave little attention to the conscience of religious organizations and employees in lifting the stay on Covid vaccine mandates. In a mere footnote of a nearly 40-page opinion, Judge Jane Branstetter Stranch brushed aside such legitimate and Constitutionally protected concerns as “premature.”<br />The president should not be able to issue an edict through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and take over all companies with over 100 employees and the healthcare decisions of their employees. But the religious-liberty harm makes that abuse even worse. The Supreme Court should not reward President Biden’s abuse of federal regulation to bully religious organizations and people of faith into submission.</td>

In the past decade or so, clothing and footwear brands have recognized that generating conversation (particularly online) by creating something outlandish often serves their purposes better than creating something beautiful. As Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele said in a recent “60 Minutes” segment, “I like the ugly things.”<br />The trick here? Ugly sells, especially when it’s buzzy. On Gucci’s website a $1,250 sweatshirt with a freakish fanged creature printed on it is nearly sold out. As are ungainly $620 heeled espadrilles covered in ostentatious Gucci print. Other brands are finding clothes that land somewhere between playfully perplexing and genuinely off-putting just as bankable. Adidas’s Yeezy Foam RNNR, a sneaker that looks like a smushed, perforated turtle shell, has sold out and is now listed at more than double its $80 sticker price on resale sites like StockX. At the higher end, the boutiquey brand ERL is selling out of its $865 puffers with a Peter Max-esque shock of colors.</td>

To paraphrase a line from the left’s favorite TV show about politics, “The West Wing”: This is not exactly a page out of Dale Carnegie.</td>

      <td>Oklahoma’s civil power is at risk, as a court order showed last week.</td>
      <td>The unraveling of state power in eastern Oklahoma is fascinating to watch—if you don’t happen to live there. The Supreme Court last year, in a case called McGirt, basically revived a set of historical Native American reservations, which now cover about two million people and the city of Tulsa. McGirt dealt only with “federal criminal law,” and its results in that sphere have been bizarre.<br />But the latest news is that a federal court has now applied McGirt to Oklahoma’s civil power—specifically, oversight of surface mining and reclamation. Judge Stephen Friot isn’t happy about his own ruling. But he says his order against the state is “legally unavoidable” and “a prime example of the havoc flowing from the McGirt decision.” The chaos, he adds, casts doubt on “core functions of state government,” putting Oklahoma “in a uniquely disadvantaged position as compared to the other forty-nine states.”</td>

      <td>As the Framers intended, it’s a crucial check on rule by transient majorities.</td>
      <td>Now that Sen. Joe Manchin has effectively killed the Build Back Better Act, there are renewed complaints on the left about the U.S. Senate. The problem with the Senate, we are told, is that it is undemocratic. As of the 2020 census, Mr. Manchin had 1.8 million constituents while California Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Alex Padilla had 39.5 million. Yet Mr. Manchin’s vote counts the same as Ms. Feinstein’s and Mr. Padilla’s. That means a West Virginia resident has 22 times the influence in the Senate as a Californian. For Wyoming, the disparity is 68 times.<br />The proposed solution to this alleged affront to democracy is proportional representation in the Senate, like in the House. Assuming that each state would have at least one senator, proportional representation, strictly implemented, would give California 68 senators, and the Senate would consist of 575 members. A Senate of such unwieldy size might be made smaller by compromising on proportionality and allowing for one senator for every, say, one million or fewer residents. But even then the Senate would number roughly 330 members, and Wyoming residents would still have nearly double the influence of Californians.</td>

If it is enacted, every American could face mandatory take-down orders for posting basic facts online about federal judges, including birth dates, spouses’ jobs and the colleges attended by their children. Because the bill stifles access to relevant information about public officials and arbitrarily limits its restrictions to the internet but not other media, it would violate the First Amendment.<br />The impetus for the proposed legislation was a tragic event: the murder last year of Daniel Anderl, son of Judge Esther Salas, at their home. Here’s how the Daniel Anderl Judicial Security and Privacy Act would work. If you post “covered information” about a federal judge online, that judge (or a designated federal official) can send you a written request to take it down. If you don’t comply within 72 hours, the judge can sue you. If you lose, you have to take down the information and pay the judge’s legal fees and court costs.</td>
