      <td>Republican lawmakers in Texas sent a voting bill to GOP Gov. Greg Abbott after overcoming months of hurdles by Democrats who sought to kill the legislation, including through a July walkout that saw many leave the state for Washington, D.C.<br />The bill, which Republicans say is a way to enhance election security, would broadly tighten voting procedures across the state. Democrats say it would restrict access to the polls, especially for minorities.<br />Gov. Abbott supports the measure and said Tuesday that he looks forward to signing it into law.<br />The battle over the bill is part of a national debate over voting rules following President Biden’s election, which former President Donald Trump and some of his supporters claim was illegitimate, though no court has found evidence of widespread voter fraud.<br />In recent months, states including Florida and Georgia passed GOP-led measures placing more restrictions on certain types of voting, drawing pushback from civil-rights groups, companies and Democrats across the U.S.</td>

      <td>Agencies in both states continue to be parsimonious with official data on pandemic-related fatalities.</td>
      <td>Andrew Cuomo may no longer be governor of New York, but officials in Albany are still covering up key facts about his deadly pandemic policies. The same is true in Michigan, where state officials are hiding important details about similarly dangerous measures enacted by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. More than 18 months into the Covid-19 pandemic, New York and Michigan are stonewalling attempts to shine light on the actions of these leaders, leaving the public in both states in the dark and making accountability much harder.<br />Our organizations have led the charge in New York and Michigan to ensure transparency regarding our governors’ pandemic policies and their effects. The Empire Center filed a Freedom of Information Law request with the Health Department in August 2020 seeking details on the Cuomo administration’s directive that nursing homes accept patients hospitalized with Covid-19. In February, a state judge ruled the agency had to turn over data, which led to initial and widely reported findings by the Empire Center that Mr. Cuomo was deliberately hiding the number of nursing home deaths.<br />That discovery was a victory for transparency, yet it was far from complete. While the Empire Center has requested 62 data sets, only five have been released. Several of those requests were denied, including one on Aug. 23, during Mr. Cuomo’s final hours in office. Newly installed Gov. Kathy Hochul admitted the next day that the death toll in nursing homes was nearly 55,400—12,000 deaths more than previously admitted—yet the underlying data are still hidden from view. Why is the state releasing information in drips? More important, what’s in the data that New York refuses to release?<br />A similar story is playing out in Michigan, where Ms. Whitmer issued a nursing home policy similar to New York’s in April 2020. Journalist Charlie LeDuff submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the state Health and Human Services Department in January. He also sought details on the connection between Gov. Whitmer’s policies and deaths at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. When his request was denied, the Mackinac Center filed a lawsuit on his behalf.<br />Mr. LeDuff ultimately settled with the Michigan HHS, which agreed to release some information. Yet the data released in May contained more questions than answers. Ms. Whitmer maintains that roughly 5,700 people died from Covid in Michigan nursing homes and other long-term-care facilities. Our best guess, based on analysis of the limited data they released, would put the number closer to 9,000. The Mackinac Center asked for more information that would enable an independent analysis of Covid-19 deaths, but that request was refused this month.</td>

      <td>Biden spins a tragedy for U.S. interests into an antiwar victory.</td>
      <td>American Presidents must make hard decisions, and we’re inclined to support them when they do so overseas in the national interest. But President Biden’s defiant, accusatory defense on Tuesday of his Afghanistan withdrawal and its execution was so dishonest, and so lacking in self-reflection or accountability, that it was unworthy of the sacrifices Americans have made in that conflict.<br />The charitable interpretation is that this is what Mr. Biden really believes about Afghanistan in particular, war in general, and how to defend the U.S. The uncharitable view is that he and his advisers have decided that the only way out of this debacle is to lie about it, blame everyone else, and claim that defeat is really a victory. Neither one is reassuring about Mr. Biden’s character, his judgment, or—most ominously—the long three-and-a-half years left in his Presidency.<br />Start with the dishonesty, although we only have space to cover some of the falsehoods. Mr. Biden again claimed he was hamstrung by Donald Trump’s bad deal with the Taliban.<br />Mr. Trump’s deal was rotten, but as a new President he could have altered it as he has so much else that Mr. Trump did. The Trump deal was based on the Taliban fulfilling conditions—such as negotiating a deal with the Afghan government—that they had already broken when Mr. Biden became President. Yet Mr. Biden claims he was both a prisoner of that deal and courageous for fulfilling it.<br />He also repeated that his only choices were total withdrawal or “escalation” with thousands of troops. His own advisers offered him alternatives in between, as did the Afghanistan Study Group. He was so bent on withdrawal, and so quickly, that he refused to adjust the military plan even as the Taliban made gains and the CIA warned that the Afghan government was likely to fall.</td>

      <td>Regulators say about half of cellphone towers in New Orleans remained offline nearly 48 hours after storm’s landfall</td>
      <td>Roughly half of cellular sites remained out of service Tuesday in New Orleans, federal regulators said, as lingering power outages after Hurricane Ida slowed efforts to restore communications links.<br />The regulators said that across the broader affected region, 17% of wireless transmitters were offline nearly 48 hours after the Category 4 storm made landfall Sunday.<br />A day after the storm, 28% of cellular transmitters were offline. The figures didn’t include temporary cell sites installed in Ida’s wake.<br />The towns of Thibodaux, Houma and other southeastern Louisiana communities still lacked reliable wireless service as of 11 a.m. ET Tuesday, according to the latest Federal Communications Commission update. Lack of electrical power was the most common culprit, followed by interruption of the landlines that link them to the outside world.<br />The downed infrastructure reveals the limits to improvements that wireless companies have added to their disaster-recovery plans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. That deadly storm flooded much of New Orleans, knocked some 911 call centers offline and cut off mobile and landline service for more than 1.8 million people.</td>

      <td>After Afghanistan, Congress’s spending choices loom larger.</td>
      <td>The blow to America’s reputation from the botched Afghanistan withdrawal is compounded by the fact that the Administration executing it is pushing for a real reduction in America’s defense spending. The message is that the U.S. is retreating from security commitments worldwide.<br />When the executive falters in foreign policy, Congress can sometimes help right the ship. The Senate Armed Services Committee this summer added $25 billion to Mr. Biden’s $715 billion Pentagon proposal, turning the proposed 1.6% nominal increase into a 5% increase—insufficient, in our view, but at least outpacing inflation.<br />The House Democratic caucus has other ideas, however. Twenty-seven Members have sent a letter to House Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith calling for him to stand by the Biden cut to the U.S. military.<br />“We request that the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 . . . not exceed an authorization level larger than the level requested in President Biden’s budget submission to Congress,” they write. One argument: “America’s largest national security threat is a global pandemic.” Not climate change?<br />These progressive Democrats have won the fight in their party on domestic spending. The needed investments in the U.S. Navy and missile deterrents are minuscule compared to the trillions going to entitlements. And Democrats in swing districts should be worried that the Afghanistan surrender will again tar Democrats as weak on national security.</td>

      <td>The Justice Department declines to appeal a ruling against the USDA’s discriminatory farm policy.</td>
      <td>The Biden Administration has been losing in court on its racially biased policies, and last week something remarkable happened. It gave up. Without explanation, the Justice Department declined to appeal a federal court injunction against a discriminatory loan-forgiveness program for farmers.<br />Democrats in their March spending bill established a $3.8 billion program to forgive loans for “socially disadvantaged” farmers. The Department of Agriculture interpreted this to include individuals “who are one or more of the following: Black/African American, American Indian, Alaskan native, Hispanic/Latino, Asian, or Pacific Islander.” White farmers need not apply.<br />More than a dozen lawsuits have been filed challenging the USDA’s racial preferences, and three so far have resulted in preliminary injunctions by district courts in Florida, Wisconsin and Texas. Justice failed to appeal the Florida injunction before its 60-day deadline last week and hasn’t contested the others.<br />Why? Perhaps it thinks it will lose on appeal and doesn’t want to risk taking these cases all the way to the Supreme Court. The farmers program is a blatant violation of the Constitution’s equal protection clause. In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District (2007), the Court held “[W]hen the government distributes burdens or benefits on the basis of individual racial classifications, that action is reviewed under strict scrutiny.”<br />The USDA program also runs afoul of the Court’s Richmond v. Croson (1989) precedent, which let governments adopt racial set-asides aimed at remedying specific episodes of past discrimination that the government had a hand in. But Justice doesn’t identify a specific incident of discrimination against minority farmers perpetuated by USDA.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is poised to unveil a series of steps aimed at addressing the U.S. shortage of entry-level homes and rental properties, according to people familiar with the matter, moves designed to boost their financing and construction over the coming years.<br />The changes would draw upon the administrative authority of government regulators such as the Federal Housing Finance Agency as Congress weighs broader policy changes tied to the debate over revamping U.S. infrastructure, according to a draft plan reviewed Tuesday by The Wall Street Journal. Details could change before the White House releases its final version. FHFA oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two mortgage giants that back about half of the $11 trillion mortgage market.<br />Individually, each regulatory move is technical and modest. Collectively, though, “they should have a meaningful impact, particularly because they are all focused on the lower end of the market, where there is the most need,” said Jim Parrott, a former Obama administration housing adviser, commenting on the draft.<br />The White House was expected to announce the moves as early as Wednesday, one of the people said.<br />One change would allow Fannie and Freddie to invest more of their resources into rental housing by boosting an existing regulatory cap on their investments in apartment projects supported by the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. A second would expand an existing competitive grant program for Community Development Financial Institutions, to encourage affordable housing production. Yet another would increase the financing available for manufactured homes, which are built in factories rather than on a lot. They typically cost much less than homes built on sites and are often occupied by lower-income residents.</td>

According to the Reuters transcript, Mr. Biden said:<br />What good did it do to present a false picture of success as the Taliban marched toward Kabul? Mr. Biden was publicly presenting such a false picture in July and it seems to have served only to deceive American civilians and our Afghan allies into thinking they had more time before they had to flee.<br />Of course what they really needed was a defense against the Taliban, but even when addressing military matters, our commander-in-chief couldn’t seem to stay focused on reality.

      <td>Maybe it’s time for a global response to a global problem.</td>
      <td>More than a few European economists have claimed for years that the Continent needs more inflation to cure the eurozone’s many ills, and now they’ve got it. Data released Tuesday showed the eurozone hitting its fastest rate of price rises in years, though we doubt it solves any problems.<br />The top-line inflation rate hit 3% year-on-year in August, up from 2.2% in July. The European Central Bank’s official target is 2% so, even under the somewhat more lax policy rule introduced this summer, someone in Frankfurt should be starting to worry. All the more so when you consider that, even excluding 15.4% energy-price inflation and 2.9% raw-food inflation, the “core” measure still clocked in at 1.6%—the fastest pace of price gains since 2012.<br />As in the U.S. and United Kingdom, the usual suspects are emerging to argue eurozone inflation will be transitory. For Europe, these allegedly temporary factors are a shortage of agricultural labor, surging demand for services such as tourism, a temporary German consumption-tax cut last year setting a deceptive baseline, and so on.<br />A political problem for ECB President Christine Lagarde is that inflation isn’t evenly distributed across the eurozone. Prices rose 4.7% in Belgium, 3.4% in inflation-hawk Germany, and 2.7% in the Netherlands—but a below-target 1.3% in Portugal and 1.2% in Greece. Inflation is supposed to help southern European economies devalue their way to prosperity on the sly, yet the economies that have inflation are those where it’s most politically toxic.<br />Then there’s Italy. An inflation rate of 2.6% is supposed to be good news for Rome, whose government debt now equals roughly 156% of GDP. Inflation is supposed to make that debt more manageable over time. That’s debatable, however, since faster price rises are likely to trigger higher interest rates that would strain Rome’s fisc.</td>

      <td>Baton Rouge, La.<br />As Hurricane Betsy tore through Louisiana in 1965, my mother held me in her arms and rocked me through the night. I was an infant with an ear infection, and as raging rain and the late hour kept us from getting medical help, Mama did what she could to comfort me in the long stretch before daylight. While the winds howled and I howled louder, the woman who had given me life a year before rocked and prayed.<br />I have no memory of that ordeal, but my mother told me the story often as a way to say, without quite spelling it out, that even the darkest night can be endured. Mama died in 2008, but I think of her every time a hurricane rolls over my home in Baton Rouge, as on Sunday when Hurricane Ida arrived.<br />Hurricanes are scary, and they are even scarier when they approach after dark. I always feel a pit in my stomach when the neighborhood transformers surrender to the gusts and the streets plunge into cast-iron gloom.<br />Keeping anxious vigil, all a seasoned veteran of hurricanes can do is listen as the storm whips one tree after another. Facing that fright in darkness makes it worse. In those moments, I usually feel deeply alone, even within the folds of family. Ida’s arrival on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina only deepened the desolation. Like many Louisianians, I recall the date of Katrina’s landfall—Aug. 29, 2005—as vividly as 9/11.</td>

In other words, no different from what other car makers, from GM to  Kia ,  provide as an option or even standard equipment. It can steer and match traffic speed on the highway or in bumper-to-bumper situations. In no case, though, are you encouraged to take your hands off the wheel and eyes off the road.<br />Tesla’s Level 2 package also appears to fail disconcertingly at a basic autonomous vehicle job, performed in many cars by a radar array costing less than $200. It doesn’t reliably avoid collisions with stationary objects such as emergency vehicles. A federal investigation has opened and we can already anticipate its findings: Tesla’s implementation of Level 2 is as good as anybody’s; the problem is caused by Tesla owners believing their cars to be more advanced than they are.</td>

      <td>Moms and dads still make decisions based on anecdotes, experience and instinct when they need to be more deliberate and businesslike.</td>
      <td>I once asked a friend why he sent his kids to private school despite living in a town with a reputation for great public schools. As it happens, my friend had gone to public school, while his wife had attended a private one. They both turned out fine, but—by his telling—he had been picked on more as a child. His sentiments echoed those of several other friends, who felt that private schools often pay more attention to students’ social and emotional development. Meanwhile, still other friends pointed to the quality of their local public schools, as well as the high cost and lack of standardized curriculum in many private schools. Discussions comparing public-school districts and location options yielded similarly mixed opinions.<br />The truth is that many parenting decisions are informed by anecdotes, experience and instinct, in part because of a dearth of accessible research. Enter “The Family Firm,” Emily Oster’s third book on data-driven parenting. It picks up where her previous work left off, serving up advice and synthesizing research for parents of young children roughly ages 5 to 12 on topics from school choice and summer camp to violin lessons, youth soccer, screen time and sleep.<br />The book’s goal is twofold. First, to provide parents with a primer on what social-science research has to say on these and other parenting dilemmas, as well as on the limits of such data. Second, to urge parents to be more deliberate in their decisions and take a more businesslike approach. Ms. Oster, an economics professor at Brown, excels at distilling academic research into digestible, action-oriented nuggets. She delivers a helpful overview on a variety of child-rearing topics and includes bullet-point summaries called “The (Data) Bottom Line.” For instance, will videogames depicting violence negatively affect your child’s behavior? Her answer: The impact “does not seem to be quantitatively important in the real-world context.” Will teaching your child the violin make him or her smarter? “There is no good evidence that learning to play music actually enhances brain function.” Should your kids go to a charter school? “In relatively poor-performing school districts, charter schools deliver (on average) better learning outcomes.”<br />While it’s good to look to the data, the book also demonstrates the limitations of research. What if you’re deciding between two schools, or between public and private schools? “If you have the resources to attend a competitive and well-funded private school, it may or may not be the right choice.” Is social media harmful to your child? “Most evidence suggests that there are no effects . . . but the evidence isn’t very good.” Is your child getting enough sleep? “If your kid is sleepy during the day or sleeping in a lot on the weekend, this is a clue that they are not getting enough.”<br />On topics such as school choice, Ms. Oster points to hard metrics like class size and test scores, but these come with their own cans of worms. For instance, a mediocre school can have good test scores if it is in a wealthy district where many children get private tutoring, while a terrific school that takes in struggling students may have low average test scores despite having a positive effect on its students. Moreover, what little data-driven guidance exists for school choice comes with some major caveats. Studies have little to say about which school will make your child happy or well adjusted. A school that fits one child might be terrible for another. As Ms. Oster notes: “There is no spreadsheet column for this.”</td>

      <td>Kansas City Southern’s shareholders are headed for an almost ideal outcome of a monthslong bidding war</td>
      <td>It’s time for this railroad’s board to punch its ticket.<br />Kansas City Southern ,  the smallest major freight railroad in the U.S., has been the subject of a bidding war between two Canadian rivals. Its shares fell Tuesday because of an unwelcome regulatory decision, but things turned out nearly as well as they could have for its shareholders.<br />Having agreed in March to be bought by  Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. , it switched to a higher bid containing more cash by that company’s larger domestic rival,  Canadian National Railway Co.  It then stuck with Canadian National after receiving a counteroffer from its original suitor earlier this month while shrewdly delaying its shareholder vote until this Friday.<br />A decision Tuesday by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board not to approve the voting trust that Canadian National was to use to purchase the shares makes its next decision obvious: KCS should snap up the $1 billion break fee it is now owed by Canadian National and go back to its original suitor with its improved bid. Canadian Pacific applied under a more lenient set of rules and already has had its voting trust approved by the STB. While that doesn’t guarantee that the agency will ultimately give the green light to an eventual merger, KCS’s shareholders can still get paid while the bureaucrats dither.<br />In theory Canadian National can appeal the STB’s decision or even proceed without a voting trust and further sweeten its offer, but KCS’s shareholders would be foolish to take that risk, which would be the equivalent of exchanging a bird in the hand for 1.1 in the bush. Without a trust, the only financial surety it can get is yet another break fee. And the STB’s unanimous decision not to approve the trust, along with tougher talk in general from the Biden administration on competition matters, makes a deal a long shot without serious concessions.</td>

      <td>President argues pullout was the right decision, cites ‘ending an era of major military operations to remake other countries’</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden vigorously defended the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, saying his administration had evacuated the vast majority of Americans who wanted to leave the country and would refrain from future military action that lacked “clear achievable goals.”<br />“I was not going to extend this forever war, and I was not extending a forever exit,” Mr. Biden said in a speech from the White House.<br />Mr. Biden’s handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan has been widely criticized by Republicans and some members of his own party. On Tuesday, he emphatically argued that it was the right decision and called the evacuations of Americans an “extraordinary success.”<br />The president addressed the nation a day after the final plane carrying American troops departed Afghanistan, formally marking the end of the nation’s longest war. The president said his administration would continue to help Americans exit the country, saying 100 to 200 of them remained after more than 5,500 Americans had gotten out before the withdrawal ended.<br />After campaigning on completing the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, Mr. Biden and top administration officials have been confronted by images of chaos as Afghans seek to flee the country and the deaths of 13 service members and dozens of Afghans in a terrorist attack attributed to ISIS-K at the Kabul airport.</td>

      <td>A three-part series on PBS looks at the way technology is shaping our jobs.</td>
      <td>The best news provided by the three-part PBS series “Future of Work” is that work has any future at all. Work by people, that is. Episode 1, “The New Industrial Revolution,” is a survey of technology and how it’s replacing humans. Judging by the show, what’s really threatening American jobs is robots.<br />Narrated, ever so monotonally, by Nkeki Obi-Melekwe and provided with a soundscape that suggests a high-rise elevator, “Future of Work” is objective to the point of frustration. Given the dire state of employment in certain sectors of the country, a little subjective ranting might have made for a more interesting program. The offending angle of this year’s Best Picture winner at the Oscars, “Nomadland,” was that it romanticized the state of retirement for a great number of Americans: Traveling the country from one Amazon “fulfillment” center to another, working seasonally and living in their RVs and vans. It’s a desperate, dead-end way of life for many older people and “Future of Work” at least portrays it as such, without offering any alternatives—or trying to deny that the march of high-tech will inevitably crush a lot of people in low-wage service sectors.<br />“Future of Work” is a trilogy—“Futureproof” airs Sept. 8; “Changing Work, Changing Workers” on Sept. 15—and it’s a painfully honest one, except in one inadvertent regard: It presumes the pandemic to be over. In surveying the way businesses such as restaurants have changed to meet the catastrophe of Covid-19, it takes the point of view that the changes implemented reflect how businesses will proceed as life gets back to “normal.” It may be a series about the future, but it can’t predict it—or whether many Americans, knowing other Americans aren’t vaccinated and the Delta variant is at large, will ever be fully comfortable resuming their old way of life.<br />The series is less dispiriting as history than it is as an oracle of employment-to-be—American workers have been through crises before, we’re reminded, and survived them. But none have been quite like the crisis examined in episode 1. Despite the show’s argument that new jobs will replace the old ones as new technologies require new skills, the point of automation has always been replacing human labor, no matter how much “Future of Work” insists otherwise. During one sequence, in which a surgeon in Nebraska walks us through a colorectal operation with all the “cobots” assisting him, all a viewer can think is: Doc, you’re next.</td>

Now, Mohammed is asking President Biden to save him.<br />“Hello Mr. President: Save me and my family,” Mohammed, who asked not to use his full name while in hiding, told The Wall Street Journal as the last Americans flew out of Kabul on Monday. “Don’t forget me here.”<br />Mohammed, his wife, and their four children are hiding from the Taliban after his yearslong attempt to get out of Afghanistan got tangled in the bureaucracy. They are among countless Afghan allies who were left behind when the U.S. ended its 20-year military campaign in Afghanistan on Monday.<br />White House press secretary Jen Psaki thanked the interpreter for his service Tuesday and said the U.S. remains committed to getting Afghan allies out of the country. “We will get you out,” Ms. Psaki said after a Wall Street Journal reporter read to Ms. Psaki Mohammed’s message to the president. “We will honor your service.”<br />Mohammed was a 36-year-old interpreter for the U.S. Army in 2008 when two U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters made an emergency landing in Afghanistan during a blinding snowstorm, according to Army veterans who worked with him at the time. On board were three U.S. senators: Mr. Biden, the Delaware Democrat, John Kerry, (D., Mass.) and Chuck Hagel, (R., Neb.).</td>

      <td>The Taliban violated the Doha agreement, so the U.S. could have stayed.</td>
      <td>The Biden administration has consistently blamed the Trump administration’s 2020 Doha agreement with the Taliban for the Afghanistan debacle. The agreement, the Biden team insists, left the president no choice but to remove U.S. forces unconditionally from Afghanistan by Aug. 31. In fact, President Biden’s failure to hold the Taliban to the terms of the Doha agreement contributed to this disaster.<br />The agreement promised the Taliban an earlier U.S. departure, by May 1, 2021, in return for a pledge that they would prevent the use of Afghanistan soil by any group against the security of the U.S. and its allies. Mr. Biden managed to extend the date by four months but was still bound by the basic terms of the agreement. The Biden administration believed that the U.S. failed to remove forces by Aug. 31, the Taliban could renege on their commitment and allow attacks on U.S. troops remaining in the country, so the only way for the U.S. to avoid this danger was to withdraw, honoring its end of the Doha deal in the hope that the Taliban would spare American forces.<br />The Biden administration has made this contrived argument repeatedly, and Mr. Biden reiterated it at a press conference last week, following the deaths of 13 U.S. service members in Kabul. But the administration misrepresents the Doha agreement. The U.S. promised to withdraw from Afghanistan by May 1, 2021, but only if the Taliban met commitments of their own. One of them was a pledge to participate in an “intra-Afghan dialogue,” to achieve a “permanent and comprehensive ceasefire” and to agree upon a “political roadmap” for Afghanistan’s future. If the Taliban didn’t honor this commitment, the U.S. had no obligation to withdraw.<br />Trump administration officials emphasized the conditional nature of the U.S. commitment when the Doha agreement was signed. As Defense Secretary Mark Esper put it in March 2020, Doha “is a conditions-based agreement.” If “we assess that the Taliban is honoring the terms of the deal,” including “progress on the political front between the Taliban and the current Afghan government,” the U.S. will “reduce our presence toward a goal of zero in 2021.” But Mr. Esper made clear that the American withdrawal wouldn’t be automatic. “If progress stalls,” he warned, “then our drawdown likely will be suspended, as well.”<br />The Taliban didn’t honor its political commitments and ultimately took Afghanistan by force. The Biden administration’s claim that the Doha agreement left no choice but to quit Afghanistan unconditionally is false. Given the Taliban’s behavior, the U.S. wasn’t obligated to withdraw by May 1, by Aug. 31, or any other date. Withdrawal was a choice. And the Biden administration’s announcement of this choice in April triggered the Taliban offensive to retake Afghanistan and set the disastrous U.S. departure in motion.</td>

      <td>Reproductive technology may lead us to realize too late that being human is better than playing God.</td>
      <td>If you could raise your infant’s IQ by four points, would you? Many parents would, and it’s now technologically feasible. Geneticists can screen embryos for traits ranging from height to facial features to intelligence. The method builds upon the procedure of in vitro fertilization, which induces the release of several eggs by hormonal treatment and fertilizes them in a lab. Genetic testing of the resulting embryos can produce predictions of the traits that the offspring are likely to exhibit, even if those traits are “polygenic” (influenced by thousands of genes with tiny effects). The parents then choose an embryo to implant in the mother. IVF is common, accounting for 10% of births in some countries.<br />All this creates unprecedented ethical challenges in the immediate future. Consider the parents who use IVF to raise their children’s IQ. If the children repeat the process for another generation, taking advantage of scientific advances during the interim, they could bring the total average gain in the grandchildren north of 10 points—a huge gain. That advantage could be big enough to give the grandchildren radically disproportionate representation at the highest levels of science, finance, information technology, medicine, law and business.<br />Imagine the behavior of any couple who plan to have a few children and can easily afford the cost of IVF—roughly $11,000 to $12,000. Virtually all upper-middle-class American couples will have it within their power to give their child a wide variety of advantages. How many parents would nonetheless choose to bring a child into the world the old-fashioned way—especially in a world where the increased use of IVF has led to improvements that increase its convenience and lower its costs? IVF could become the norm for the upper middle class. Congress could pass legislation that subsidizes IVF among lower-income populations, but only a highly intrusive policy is likely to stop the magnification of inequality.<br />Many think genetic enhancement will be a wonderful thing. In some ways, it might be. But if the old-fashioned way of making babies becomes a thing of the past, we may come to miss it for more than sentimental reasons. Natural selection has a way of eliminating traits that aren’t necessary for survival or reproduction. Studies of cave-dwelling animals that have become blind suggest that the responsible mutations were strongly favored by selection. Whether such a process would knock out sexuality in humans over centuries or millennia is hard to say, and there is also the wild card of what a much more technologically advanced society might be able or willing to do. But unless ethical concerns or further biological tinkering turns us back, we will have set ourselves on a trajectory—perhaps slow, perhaps not so slow—of losing an aspect of our nature even more fundamental than our intellect.<br />There are further prospects for reproductive technology that pose an even more immediate threat to sexuality. These include the production of both sperm and eggs from the mature cells of a person of either sex. If thousands of viable eggs can be harvested in a single batch, then the expected gain from polygenic screening will be more than doubled. The clear and present danger to sexuality, however, comes from the elimination of the biological requirement of having a father and mother. Same-sex couples could have biological children. Once the necessity and desirability of natural conception have been undone, the immemorial bond that has made the sexes one flesh could be dissolved, leaving behind two alienated “species” with little in common.</td>

      <td>Sacha Jenkins’s documentary about the funk rocker includes the wild stories of his life, but also argues for James’s broader cultural impact.</td>
      <td>Seventeen years after his death, Rick James is probably best remembered for providing MC Hammer the signature riff for his massive hit “U Can’t Touch This” and for being the punchline of one of Dave Chappelle’s trademark routines (“I’m Rick James, bitch!”). So “Bitchin: The Sound and Fury of Rick James,” by director Sacha Jenkins, doesn’t exactly rescue the proto funk-rocker from oblivion. It just gives him his overdue due.<br />James, whose brand was excess, died in 2004 at age 56 after years of drug abuse, a stretch in prison, and a career making his personal amalgam of R&B, pop and soul (“It’s like disco and funk eloped,” someone quips off-camera). What makes James an astoundingly rich subject are the stories that constitute his story, at least as told by Mr. Jenkins: While AWOL from the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam War, James was rescued from a racist beating on a Toronto street by a group of men who also happened to be musicians—The Hawks, who would later back up Bob Dylan and become The Band. He became friends with such Canadian artists as Joni Mitchell and was a member of an act called the Mynah Birds that included Neil Young and Bruce Palmer (shortly of Buffalo Springfield). That band was signed by Motown and recorded with back-up vocals by the Supremes. Living in Los Angeles, James befriended a hairdresser named Jay Sebring, who invited him to a party at the home of Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski. Too tired to attend, James just missed becoming a footnote in the Manson murders.<br />Mr. Jenkins can’t disguise his admiration for James’s abilities as a bandleader, innovator and self-promoter, or his dismay at the self-destructive or simply impolitic decisions that determined his subject’s life. Crack was one kind of problem; his calling out of MTV for its perceived racist programming—at a critical time in his career—was another. His 1993 conviction for kidnapping and sexually torturing two women in two different instances is dealt with at length, though both James (in archival interviews) and his then-wife Tanya Hijazi (in a new interview) argue that the crimes involved crack parties gone wrong. James is hardly portrayed as an angel. But as is true of his other nonfiction films, Mr. Jenkins (“Word Is Bond,” “Wu-Tang Clan: Of Mics and Men”) is looking at the big picture, and when he looks at the last half of the 20th century he keeps finding Rick James here and there, a Zelig-like maker of mischief, musical and otherwise.<br />The filmmaker gets help from some learned authorities, notable among them the cultural scholar Jason King and biographer David Ritz, who provide a number of insightful observations about James—including one, from Mr. Ritz, that applies to many performers who finally achieve the celebrity they’ve so desperately craved: The hustler energy that propels someone like a Rick James to stardom—no one argues he was a great musician—doesn’t dissipate once he reaches the top. It just gets channeled into something less creative, productive or healthy.<br />Mr. Jenkins spends just about half of “Bitchin” telling the making-of story of Rick James the artist, tracing his roots to some surprising places—Thelonious Monk, for instance (when the rapper Big Daddy Kane describes the “odd” construction of some James numbers, he’s linking James to the jazz great’s fracturing of song form). James was a fan of the always underappreciated yet enormously influential Louis Jordan, whose showmanship can certainly be seen in James the effervescent performer. George Clinton, Bootsy Collins and the whole Parliament-Funkadelic empire were huge influences, but James’s early efforts in Canadian-influenced folk rock also indicate not just a catholic taste but a willingness to embrace whatever genre would make him a star.</td>

Pilots have threatened to picket ahead of the winter holidays. The airline has apologized to workers for difficulties this summer and is stepping up hiring efforts.<br />In the lawsuit, the union cited the extended time-off program Southwest set up last year, offering pilots the option to take time off from flying and forgo pay in an effort to conserve cash, as an example of something that the company and union should have negotiated.</td>

Once the reserves are exhausted, benefits would be reduced automatically unless Congress steps in to shore up the program, which lawmakers have done previously.<br />The trustees now project elevated mortality rates related to the pandemic through 2023, and expect lower immigration and child-bearing this year and next, compared with their 2020 estimates. They also expect the pandemic has lowered worker productivity and thus economic output permanently.<br />“These alterations to near-term data and assumptions all significantly impact the outlook of the programs,” they said in the report.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Treasury Department is seeking public input on the effects of natural disasters and other climate-related risks to the insurance industry, the latest step the Biden administration has taken to tackle concerns posed by climate change.<br />A Treasury office charged with monitoring the insurance industry is seeking public input for 75 days on how climate change could affect private insurers, including which data are needed to develop standardized climate-related financial risk disclosures for the sector.<br />“Over the past 30 years, the incidence of natural disasters has dramatically increased and the actual and future potential cost to the economy has skyrocketed,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. “We are now in a situation where climate change is an existential risk to our future economy and way of life”<br />Tuesday’s move is part of the Biden administration effort to address climate change and its impact on various industries. The Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to require more disclosures from public companies on the potential impact of climate change on their businesses.<br />Treasury’s request for information is likely to inform the data the department’s Federal Insurance Office collects from the industry and the information it shares with states, which are the primary regulators of insurance companies. “Maintaining the financial stability of the insurance sector will involve identifying and filling gaps (if any) in insurance supervision with a focus on assessing climate-related financial risks,” Treasury said.</td>

      <td>SINGAPORE—Under President Xi Jinping, China’s Communist Party has moved to aggressively reassert control over the economy, going after some of the country’s largest private enterprises in a drive to dial back what it sees as the capitalist excesses of a previous era.<br />Now, the party, which is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its founding this year, is making it increasingly clear that it intends to insert itself into the private lives of Chinese citizens to an extent not seen in decades.<br />This week, party officials unveiled tough new limits on the amount of time Chinese young people can spend playing online games. The restrictions come amid a crackdown on pop culture icons and follow moves to sharply limit after-school tutoring.<br />Taken together, these moves represent a shift in the social contract that existed under Mr. Xi’s two immediate predecessors, in which the party expanded personal freedoms in exchange for acquiescence to the party’s monopoly on politics.<br />The party says its aim is to more actively shape the next generation of Chinese people.</td>

Ralph Northam granted posthumous pardons on Tuesday for seven Black men, known as the “Martinsville Seven,” who were executed decades ago after all-white juries convicted them of raping a white woman.<br />The Democratic governor said the young men, most of whom were between 18 and 21 years old, weren’t given fair due process and their executions were racially biased due to how the death sentence was used in cases involving white defendants, a statement from his office said.<br />“This is about righting wrongs,” Mr. Northam said. “We all deserve a criminal justice system that is fair, equal, and gets it right—no matter who you are or what you look like.”<br />Mr. Northam’s office said the pardons don’t have to do with the mens’ guilt but rather their “unjust, racial-biased sentences” and “disturbing lack of due process.” The seven men were convicted and sentenced in eight days in 1951, the governor’s office said, with some defendants “impaired” when they were arrested, unable to read their signed confessions or without attorneys present.<br />More than two decades after their executions, the Supreme Court ruled the death penalty was unconstitutional punishment for rape.</td>

      <td>Site will be available for $5 every four weeks or as part of a Times premium bundle</td>
      <td>New York Times Co.  plans to put its consumer product-review site Wirecutter behind a paywall as the publisher looks to further diversify its subscription business beyond its flagship news product.<br />Starting Wednesday, readers can purchase a stand-alone Wirecutter subscription for $5 every four weeks, or $40 annually. Those who already pay for the Times’ premium digital subscriptions or home delivery will continue to get unlimited access to Wirecutter, with no change to the subscription’s price.<br />The Times, in its digital incarnation, is seeking to serve some auxiliary needs that traditional print newspapers once served, including by providing recipes and games and by helping users decide what products to buy, said David Perpich, head of the Times’ stand-alone products group. Wirecutter, which the Times Company bought in 2016, is a consumer guide that reviews everything from cable modems to cat litter.<br />The Times and most other major news organizations have put a greater emphasis on generating subscription revenue over the past several years, in part because of the uncertainty of the online advertising market. At the Times, the core news product powered a subscription boom during the Trump years and the early stages of the pandemic, but that growth has slowed in recent quarters.<br />“The New York Times Company strategy has been about creating content worth paying for, and increasingly using subscription strategies to monetize those products,” said Mr. Perpich, who is the nephew of Arthur Sulzberger Jr., former chairman and publisher of the Times.</td>

Madoff Investment Securities LLC and by the federal district court in New York, which found the trustee was required to prove that Citi lacked good faith by being “willfully blind” to “red flags” of fraudulent activity.<br />The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday that wasn’t the correct standard, and that Mr. Picard only had to demonstrate that Citi lacked good faith because it was aware of suspicious facts that would have led a reasonable person to investigate further.<br />Citi declined to comment Tuesday. Seanna R. Brown, a lawyer with Mr. Picard’s team, said the court ruling is an important victory for account holders of BLMIS who haven’t fully recovered their losses from the Ponzi scheme.</td>

      <td>Design pro Mike Rupp turned a Manhattan house packed with decades of collecting and chaotic decorating into a quietly distinctive home. His secret weapon? Pale blue.</td>
      <td>WHEN INTERIOR DESIGNER Mike Rupp accepted the task of revamping an 1843 Greek Revival townhouse in New York’s Gramercy neighborhood, he knew it wouldn’t be a walk in the park. Decades of decoration by the client herself had yielded a cluttered, directionless space filled with traditional, oversize furniture in clashing colors and patterns. “Things were out of scale with the space, and colors didn’t harmonize,” said Mr. Rupp.<br />The collections the client and her husband had amassed added to the hodgepodge: art from travels to Africa and copious greyhound figurines inspired by their rescues of the oft-forsaken breed. The surfeit of stuff made visitors feel a bit like children in a preciously decorated house. “They’re not formal people,” Mr. Rupp said of the couple. “They’re casual and warmhearted and wanted guests to feel the same way.”<br />He introduced his client to the pared-back but handcrafted side of 20th-century modernism through artists and designers like Pierre Jeanneret, George Nakashima and Paul R. Evans. Sumptuous textures and a tight palette of blue and green pastels and neutrals further warmed the home, tying together 20th-century furniture, 19th-century architecture and many styles of art. “Don’t be afraid to surround yourself with color,” said Mr. Rupp, “but it doesn’t have to be poppy, bold and aggressive.”<br />The second-floor parlor comprises a living and dining area, whose walls are clad in a nearly neutral pale blue paint, Whispering Spring from Benjamin Moore. In the dining space, Mr. Rupp upholstered the Wegner chairs that surround a walnut Nakashima table in a leather of a similarly muted blue. The black shades of the midcentury-styled chandelier visually connect to the shapes in a triptych by British artist Lisa Giles, and a geometrically patterned carved-wool rug with blue in the ground unifies the two rooms and “invites guests to get comfortable” on the carpet’s high pile.<br />The client fell for the furniture of Pierre Jeanneret during the design process—so much so that Mr. Rupp had to “put his foot down” to prevent her from buying too much—and so he took care to put a piece in the bathroom. “I wanted her to start her day with a piece that makes her happy,” he said. The biggest bathroom-design mistake? “Denying the space of [one’s] personality,” he said. “You don’t want to make it like a hotel bathroom.” Here, he added a Tuareg mat and the same paint as the parlor’s.</td>

Many nations are putting the needs of their tourism sectors, which have sorely missed big-spending American visitors, ahead of EU recommendations to block U.S. tourists.<br />The EU’s decision on Monday to remove the U.S. from its list of safe countries for travel amid the pandemic reflects the growing spread of the Delta variant in the U.S., where vaccination rates have fallen behind those in many EU countries. The decision also reflects EU frustration that the U.S. hasn’t reciprocated the EU’s efforts to reopen trans-Atlantic travel, instead remaining closed for nonessential travel from Europe.</td>

      <td>IN AUGUST 2020, when Jeff Deshon peered out the windows of his Fairfield, Calif., home, the sky was so sickly orange “it looked like an apocalypse,” he said, with smoke spouting from the LNU Lightning Complex Fires just 2 miles away. And the acrid air had bullied its way inside.<br />Mr. Deshon quickly took action, buying three Molekule air purifiers that September, then a fourth the next month. The odor improved throughout the home he shares with his wife, especially in their bedroom, where they installed a purifier and kept the door clamped shut.<br />Home air purifiers, designed to be easily plugged into a standard outlet to cleanse contained indoor atmospheres with just a whisper of white noise, do more than improve odors. They work as a way to clear haze and eradicate some of the worst pollutants from wildfire smoke, said Dr. Mary Prunicki, director of air pollution and health research at Stanford University’s Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research. To really help vanquish the effects of smoke, Ms. Prunicki recommended seeking out an air purifier with a HEPA filter—an acronym for high-efficiency particulate air. Here, four new-guard purifiers to satisfy a range of tastes and needs.<br />An anodized aluminum device with a vegan leather strap, Molekule Air Pro, is handsome enough to be sold by the Museum of Modern Art’s Design Store. Molekule’s patented PECO (or photo electrochemical oxidation) filter—designed to beat a HEPA filter—claims to eliminate 99% of even the finest PM1.0 polluting particles in a 1,000 cubic foot chamber in around 20 minutes, and gaseous VOCs like toluene in about three hours. A touch-screen built into the purifier’s top and an accompanying app both monitor how well it’s working, and let you switch to quiet mode for movie night. $1,199, molekule.com<br />At just 34-by-13.4 inches, the compact Blueair HealthProtect 7710i claims to filter a 674-square-foot room in 12 minutes, suitable for postage-stamp-sized studio apartments or petite rooms like nurseries. Its HEPA filtration technology claims to use 55% less energy than competitors, with an estimated 10% less racket.

In Afghanistan, they have failed the test.<br />Many Afghan journalists are furious at the U.S. “The international community and the U.S. committed to building human rights, women’s rights and press freedom in the country,” said Farida Nekzad, who fled Afghanistan last week but whose husband and son are still in Kabul. “We were thankful they did. Then they killed it in a minute and destroyed all our achievements.” Ms. Nekzad, who cofounded the independent Pajhwok Afghan News agency to hold the powerful accountable, said her dreams of a better future for her country have been dashed.<br />“I feel absolutely betrayed,” said another leading independent journalist, who has made it to safety but asked not to be named because his family is still in Kabul. “Do you think anyone will ever believe in the promise of democracy again?”<br />Hundreds of Afghan journalists who worked for international news organizations, including The Wall Street Journal,  New York Times  and Washington Post, have gotten out of Afghanistan thanks to the ingenuity of their employers. But those working for the local media, including news organizations supported by U.S. government grants, have been largely left behind. As the Pulitzer Prize Board honored them last week for their courageous reporting, many were moving from house to house hiding from the Taliban.<br />The Biden administration can still meet its humanitarian commitments and advance its foreign-policy agenda by stepping up efforts to get Afghan journalists to safety.

      <td>This back-to-school season is filled with uncertainty. Public school districts are dealing with delays, disruptions, disagreements and demands from teachers unions. At the heart of many disputes is whether schools should require all students to wear masks. Some states are in legal battles over the issue.<br />A recent Axios/Ipsos Poll found that 69% of U.S. adults support mandatory masking in schools. The policy is politically polarizing, however, with 92% of Democrats and only 44% of Republicans supporting it.<br />The good news is that we might find some unity amid such division. A nationwide poll by Echelon Insights in August found that 79% of respondents with an opinion support allowing families to take their children’s taxpayer-provided education money to a private or home school if their public school doesn’t mandate masks. Surprisingly, Democrats favored this school-choice proposal more than Republicans, with support at 82% and 78%, respectively.<br />Another recent nationwide poll, by RealClear Opinion Research, found that support for school choice surged by 11 percentage points among registered Democrats during the pandemic—from 59% in April 2020 to 70% in June 2021.<br />We’ve all learned a lot over the past 18 months. The battles over school reopenings, masking and curriculum have revealed the main problem with the one-size-fits-all public school system. Many Republicans supported school choice well before 2020. But Democratic voters are now also realizing that uniform school systems won’t always work in their favor.</td>

      <td>Sales of securities backed by bundles of risky corporate loans set a new monthly record in August, powered by improving corporate earnings and investor demand for relatively higher yields.<br />Issuance of new collateralized loan obligations, which buy up corporate loans with junk credit ratings and package them into securities, were more than $18.7 billion this month, as of Thursday, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence’s LCD. That is the highest monthly total in data going back to January 2011.<br />This month’s sales are a notable reversal from last year. Then, pandemic fears sent prices on riskier debt plummeting, halting new issuance of so-called CLOs. Broad-based support for markets from the Federal Reserve, which included cutting interest rates to near zero, injecting liquidity into markets and buying bonds, has since helped renew investor demand.<br />This year is now shaping up to be one of the best ever for CLOs. Based on collateral and cash balances, the size of the global market surpassed $1 trillion, according to JPMorgan. For the year as a whole, Bank of America analysts are projecting $140 billion in new U.S. CLOs sales and $220 billion in refinancings and resets, when a portfolio’s maturity is extended and it is repriced.<br />A strong recovery in corporate earnings is helping drive investor demand for CLOs, analysts said. During the second quarter, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, rose 21% from the same period a year earlier for public companies in the S&P/LTSA leveraged-loan index.</td>

In the U.S., 63% of people 18 or over are fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

      <td>Only governments can create sustainable monopolies.</td>
      <td>Regarding Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.’s “Let a Biden Rethink Include Antitrust” (Business World, Aug. 28): Under U.S. antitrust laws, it can be illegal for a company to: (1) set prices below competition; (2) set prices above competition; and (3) set prices to match competition. How can a company avoid guilt?<br />Decades ago, the Federal Trade Commission doubled down on the absurdity by suing Westinghouse and GE for offering large turbine generators at matching prices, even though the government conceded that the two firms did not collude to fix prices. The government essentially demanded that the companies stop being aware of their competitor’s prices.<br />In a free market, companies earn great market power only by benefiting their customers. Nevertheless, they must always be looking over their shoulders lest a competitor or shifting technology undercut them. Note that Westinghouse no longer exists and GE is a shadow of its former majesty. In reality, only governments can create sustainable monopolies.<br />Most likely U.S. presidents love their arbitrary antitrust weapon because they can use it to intimidate or punish successful firms that displease them. Rather than fight this piecemeal, it might be more realistic for companies to combine their lobbying power to persuade Congress to repeal U.S. antitrust law. Perhaps they can also promise to pay to retrain unemployed antitrust lawyers.<br />Rich Batey</td>

      <td>The restrictions make it difficult to secure proper and prompt treatment.</td>
      <td>Regarding Dr. Nathan Punwani’s letter “Medicare Advantage Shows the Path Forward” (Aug. 30): My wife and I are on Medicare and enrolled in a Medicare Advantage health-maintenance-organization plan. My wife has been suffering from a so-far-undiagnosed severe pain following hip surgery last year. We have tried two HMO plans. Both severely limit the nearby doctors you can see, and referrals can take over 30 days because they must go from Dr. A to your primary-care physician, then to the insurance company for approval before you can make an appointment, assuming the doctor is in network. Obtaining outside-network treatment is very difficult.<br />The number of physicians, including primary care and even at urgent-care centers, is quite limited with both of the HMOs that my wife has used. Since many places, including the Mayo Clinic, will not accept fee for service or self-pay, especially if you have an HMO, we have been limited further.<br />Unless you are fortunate enough to be on Kaiser or a similar program, there is no coordination between entities. Moreover, Medicare’s arbitrary enrollment rules eliminate the possibility of changing from an HMO to a preferred provider organization (PPO) until the open-enrollment period, and then it won’t take effect until Jan. 1.<br />Both former Gov. Bobby Jindal (“The Danger of Expanding Medicare,” op-ed, Aug. 26) and Dr. Punwani are concerned about cost, but we are concerned about getting proper and prompt treatment and certainly would not recommend expanding Medicare Advantage in its current form. Perhaps the good doctor should move to a nonurban area and try a Medicare HMO plan.<br />George Waters</td>

      <td>Polls show Democrat with narrow lead in state Joe Biden won nearly two-to-one</td>
      <td>California voters will decide whether to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom in a special election Sept. 14. Recent polls project Mr. Newsom winning, but with a lead within the margin of error among likely voters. The leading candidate among the 46 vying to replace him is Republican talk-show host Larry Elder.<br />The recall effort began early last year, driven by conservatives unhappy with his leadership on a variety of issues. It gained steam amid growing unhappiness over business and school shutdowns, mask mandates and other rules he instituted to try and slow the spread of Covid-19. By April, the recall petition had just over 1.7 million signatures, enough to make it the second gubernatorial recall in California history to qualify for the ballot.<br />California voters face two questions on the ballot. The first is a “yes” or “no” on whether Mr. Newsom should be recalled. The second is who should replace him if he is recalled. Voters can pick a candidate on the second question even if they vote “no” on the first. Under California law, Mr. Newsom cannot run to replace himself and there are no other prominent Democrats running. The governor’s campaign is urging supporters to skip the second question.<br />Regardless of the outcome, California will hold a regularly scheduled gubernatorial election in 2022, with a primary in which candidates of all parties must compete in June and a runoff for the top two vote-getters in November. If June’s winner gets more than 50% of the vote, the runoff won’t be held.<br />The Democrat’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in California has become the most prominent issue in the race. Critics say his shutdown of businesses was too extreme, school closures lasted too long and that restrictions on indoor worship violated the U.S. Constitution’s first amendment, a position with which courts have agreed. They have also said mask mandates are examples of intrusive big government and criticized him for shifting rules. Mr. Newsom has said state restrictions saved lives by limiting the spread of the coronavirus and that he had to adjust to changing circumstances.</td>

      <td>When it comes to jeans and trousers, a lot of men passionately fall into one of these camps. We explore both styles’ merits—and propose some happy-medium options.</td>
      <td>MEN’S PANTS have gone through every possible design configuration over the last decades: from suffocating stove-pipe pants to roomy ’70s flares and “baggies,” with tight pants reasserting themselves in the 1980s new-wave era. And the loose-tight style pendulum kept swinging into the ’90s and up to today, when we find ourselves at an interesting crossroads. Even as skinny jeans continue to lose currency, a lot of men remain fans of narrow cuts. But wide is surging in style-forward circles. And so battle lines are being drawn. Here are two (very strong) points of view.<br />From the moment  you slip into spacious slacks, say men in the broad-pant camp, you can smugly take pleasure in knowing you are modish and, unlike your tightly clad counterparts, won’t be called “basic” by judgmental teens. This was part of the draw for Stewart Bean, a 34-year-old graphic designer in Manhattan, when earlier this year, he bought JW Anderson x Uniqlo jeans that felt “huge” compared with the straight-leg denim he’d been wearing. “As someone in my mid-30s, I didn’t want to seem dated or be left behind,” said Mr. Bean. “I do feel like I’m joining a club of big-pants youths.”<br />That said, his advocacy of ample pants is not just about being on-trend. Mr. Bean said he feels “more free” in them, while Kyle Norville, a teacher in Brooklyn, enjoys the heightened comfort billowing pants deliver. “I have room around my thigh. I can walk, bend and run more easily” than in slim fits, said Mr. Norville, 31. He has appreciated the pants’ roominess as his weight has yo-yoed during the pandemic. And after a year of working from home, slacks with breathing room seem a natural progression from his other Covid standby, pajamas, as he ventures out.<br />Voluminous pants let Derek Manansala, 28, a film director’s assistant in Los Angeles, experiment with “shapes” when assembling ensembles. His stack includes a navy pair with parachute-like dimensions from Parisian brand Casey Casey. “With menswear there’s not too much to play around with,” said Mr. Manansala. “Wider pants help me make interesting outfits.” He pairs his with oversize shirts for a “flowy” look or slim tops for contrast. And Mr. Bean plays the opposites-attract game by teaming his wide pants with slight Bode house shoes.<br />To avoid looking sloppy, London stylist Mitchell Belk suggests such simple tricks as tucking in a T-shirt or cuffing a hem. No matter how slouchy the pants, they have to “fit somewhere,” emphasized Nick Wakeman, founder of Studio Nicholson, a London brand known for capacious cuts that nevertheless always hug the waist and backside.</td>

June marked the highest annual rate of price growth since the index began in 1987.<br />Home prices have skyrocketed this year, as the inventory of homes for sale remains well below typical levels and ultralow interest rates have spurred demand. Homes listed for sale this spring and summer routinely received multiple offers and sold above asking price.<br />The Case-Shiller index, which measures repeat-sales data, reports on a two-month delay. Since June, the housing-market frenzy has slowed slightly, though prices continue to rise at a rapid pace. The median existing-home sales price in July rose 17.8% from a year earlier to $359,900, the National Association of Realtors said earlier this month.<br />“The last several months have been extraordinary not only in the level of price gains, but in the consistency of gains across the country,” said Craig Lazzara, managing director and global head of index investment strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices.</td>

The double-digit growth reflects a comparison with a year earlier when the economy contracted by about 24%, the country’s sharpest decline on record.<br />India was the first nation to be hit by a major Covid-19 wave driven by the Delta variant, slowing a recovery that began in late 2020. The country’s economic activity remains well below pre-pandemic levels.<br />The economic damage from the spring surge was limited because the country didn’t impose a nationwide lockdown like the one that caused the severe contraction the previous year, economists say. Still, cities and states imposed local lockdowns, and many Indians restricted their movements voluntarily to protect themselves, with the country recording more than 400,000 cases a day at its peak and hospitals overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients.<br />The surge has meant a slowed recovery for Indians who were still reeling from the financial impact of the previous year.

Including the latest push, Fidelity’s total workforce is expected to grow more than 22% this year, to over 60,000 employees.<br />Drawn to the market’s rally, individual investors have changed the fortunes of the brokerage industry. The no-commission stock trades and low-fee investment funds now offered by many firms have brought in plenty of new clients. They also have thinned money managers’ profit margins and forced them to compete on price. Traditional products, like stock- and bond-picking mutual funds, have been leaking client money.<br />It is a trade-off Fidelity and some of its peers are willing to make. As more transactions course through their platforms, the costs associated with processing each of them drops. These firms also are betting many of the new account-holders will eventually graduate to more-expensive offerings, including financial advice.<br />The conditions that captivated many new, younger investors last year have continued in 2021, straining the call centers, websites and trading platforms that respond to customers’ questions and process their transactions. The major U.S. stock indexes touched record highs last week, buoyed by news that regulators had given full approval for one of the Covid-19 vaccines and Congress pressed ahead on a $1 trillion infrastructure bill.</td>

      <td>A speedy—and highly scenic—new way to travel from New York City to Boston is also one of the oldest: the storied seaplane</td>
      <td>THE FIRST seaplanes in 50 years to fly scheduled service between Boston and New York City splashed down in their cities’ respective harbors this summer, and even the most jaded travelers took notice. These partly waterborne journeys clock in at about 90 minutes, beating traffic jams at an airport checkpoint—or on I-95—any day.<br />Tailwind Air promotes its flights as the fastest downtown-to-downtown trip in the market. But you can also think of them as time-travel back to the golden age of flying. Seaplanes have been around for more than 100 years. The terminal on the East River in Manhattan where you take off was built in 1936, when scarce airport runway space favored these maritime depots.<br />The 1930s was also the heyday of the flying boat—a bulky vessel whose fuselage acted as the hull, floating it when the plane was in the water. These flying ships plied Pacific and Atlantic routes and reached their apogee (or nadir, depending on your viewpoint) with Howard Hughes’ Spruce Goose, a gigantic wooden flying boat that required eight engines to get aloft—which, on its first and only flight in 1947, it managed for just 26 seconds. Though modern aviation advances ended the flying boats’ run as passenger planes, a few still operate today, fulfilling industrial functions such as carrying water to fight fires.<br />The amphibious Cessna Caravans operated by Tailwind hardly resemble the glamorous “Pan Am Clippers” of the past; they’re diminutive, single-engine floatplanes with pontoons. Capable of landing on land as well as water, they are mainly drafted for sightseeing excursions or, in Tailwind’s other market, ferrying well-heeled weekenders and commuters from Manhattan to the Hamptons in a mere 40 minutes.<br />With a capacity of eight passengers—arranged single file, so everyone has a window—neither Tailwind flight offers much luxury but they’re still not cheap. Fares start at $395 one-way for the New York City to Boston route, which, as of Aug. 31, will offer four flights every weekday. And because the fleet doesn’t include flying icebreakers, the seaplane will only take off March to November.</td>

      <td>First read on August data suggests China’s economy slowed further, particularly in services but also in the previously strong manufacturing sector</td>
      <td>It has been a difficult summer for the world’s second-largest economy—a fact fully confirmed by China’s official August purchasing managers’ indexes, released Tuesday. The big question now is how Beijing will respond.<br />The economy needs more support to avoid a steeper fall in growth, but that may be difficult to engineer without easing restrictions on the critical real-estate sector. Regulators are determined to prevent another sharp rise in leverage.<br />The reason for the vertiginous drop in the services sector index, from 52.5 to 45.2, is already well known: Efforts to contain the Delta variant outbreak originating in Nanjing hammered tourism and shut down some important cities in the country’s eastern economic heartland. With the outbreak now apparently under control, a strong rebound is likely in September—although consumer hesitancy, a tough labor market for young people, and the damage to household balance sheets from last year’s spring shutdowns will continue to prevent a full recovery to the pre-2020 trend.<br />But the weakness wasn’t confined to services, which tend to be most vulnerable to lockdowns. Factories’ new export orders fell to their lowest level since June 2020. And overall new orders fell through the 50 point mark separating expansion from contraction for the first time since the dark days of February 2020—though just barely.<br />That latter dip probably has a lot to do with the struggles of the property sector. Broader August economic data isn’t available yet, but property investment in July rose only 1.4% year over year, the smallest gain since March 2020. Curbs on property developer leverage are starting to bite, and bite hard. Output growth in heavy industrial products tied to real estate has also taken a dive in the past few months, although some of that is related to Beijing’s efforts to cap steel output at 2020 levels this year. Infrastructure investment has also weakened.</td>

The Department of Homeland Security, the lead agency coordinating the resettlement effort, didn’t respond to a request for comment.<br />Resettlement-agency leaders held a call Sunday with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, in which he pledged his cooperation but mostly listened to the issues raised, according to two people on the call.<br />The groups also don’t know which of the arriving Afghans will come with approved Special Immigrant Visas, which entitle them to a panoply of services, including months of healthcare and food assistance. The visa program was designed for Afghans who worked alongside the American military during the two-decade war.</td>

      <td>Stock investors have gained access to a new crop of space-related companies that offer more grounded opportunities than higher-profile cosmic tourism ventures</td>
      <td>Almost 50 years after humans last walked on the Moon, private capital has sparked a new space race. Shooting rich people into space gets all the press, but investors probably should pay closer attention to the more humdrum business of launching small satellites.<br />Special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, are still funding the new space economy. This past week, Virgin Orbit, a firm dedicated to launching small satellites, said it would go public via such a vehicle. Its rival Rocket Lab also hit the stock market upon completion of its own SPAC deal announced in March. A third California-based competitor, Astra, has been publicly traded for two months.<br />Space-related headlines have mostly centered on British billionaire Richard Branson and  Amazon.com  founder Jeff Bezos racing to leave the Earth’s atmosphere. Of their two companies, only Mr. Branson’s Virgin Galactic—from which Virgin Orbit was spun out in 2017—is publicly traded following a 2019 SPAC deal, making it the focus of the “meme stock” craze. The firm’s enterprise value trades at a staggering 69 times the earnings it is expected to generate in 2025.<br />Footage of Mr. Branson floating around was an effective publicity stunt for space investing. Yet the new crop of companies deserves more attention.<br />Miniaturization has slashed the cost of making satellites. A constellation of them launched into low orbits, such as the Starlink system designed by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, opens up countless applications. To be sure, early movers like OneWeb have already run into trouble, echoing the disappointment that followed a previous wave of satellite ambitions in the 1990s. Yet the prize is big enough to attract enduring interest: Of the $1 trillion in revenues that analysts at  Morgan Stanley  expect of the space economy by 2040, half might come from satellites.</td>

Prosus shares rose 5% Tuesday following the announcement.<br />The acquisition will bring Prosus’s cumulative investment in Indian tech to more than $10 billion since 2005, as the company seeks to profit from what was the world’s fastest-growing major economy before the coronavirus pandemic.<br />BillDesk, which currently competes with Prosus’s PayU in India, allows its customers to aggregate invoices and organize, pay and manage their bills in one place. Founded in 2000, it generated an after-tax profit of $36.8 million in the year ended March, while its net assets were valued at about $256.9 million largely in cash and cash equivalents.<br />Digital retail payments are growing rapidly in India, an economy of more than 1.3 billion people that the International Monetary Fund expects to expand by 9.5% this year.

New data show that the companies’ fundamentals are improving, but significant questions over Covid-19 variants and business travel could still undercut a rebound.<br />Real-estate investment trusts are behind many hotels and resorts. Companies such as  Host Hotels & Resorts Inc.  and  Apple Hospitality REIT Inc.  own the hotel properties and earn revenue from rooms rented and food and drinks sold. In turn, the REITs pay management fees to operators such as  Marriott International Inc.  to run the properties.<br />Hotel REITs are among the riskier real-estate bets because rooms turn over every day and travel is particularly vulnerable to economic swings. They were among the hardest hit when the pandemic began. New data suggest things are getting better. In the second quarter, hotel REITs’ cumulative funds from operations—an earnings metric widely used in commercial real estate—turned positive for the first time since early last year, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.<br />Higher revenues helped Apple Hospitality and Pebblebrook Hotel Trust deliver their first quarterly net profits since late 2019 and early 2020, respectively, while losses at Host and another big hotel REIT,  Ryman Hospitality Properties Inc.,  both narrowed substantially.<br />“That’s a really encouraging development,” said Calvin Schnure, a senior economist for the association, noting that business travel has rebounded far less than leisure trips. “You have a lot more potential upside in that sector,” he said.</td>

Asking rents for houses rose nearly 13% for the year to date through July, the highest annual increase in the past five years as tracked by real-estate data company Yardi Matrix, which analyzed professionally managed properties.<br />The sharp rise partly reflects increasing demand from people who can’t afford to buy homes as well as city-dwellers who moved to the suburbs to rent during the pandemic. Meanwhile, the supply of new houses also continues to trail historical levels relative to population growth, and builders in some places remain constrained by zoning laws and available land.<br />Price increases are more moderate for single-family tenants renewing their leases, said Haendel St. Juste, a real-estate securities analyst at Mizuho Securities USA. “You’ve got to be careful in this industry. You can’t be perceived as gouging.”<br />Apartment asking rents also have risen, but at a slower pace: 8.3% for the year to date through July, Yardi Matrix said.

      <td>The group has conducted a string of deadly attacks, primarily targeting members of Afghanistan’s Shiite Hazara minority. Here’s what you need to know.</td>
      <td>The U.S. on Sunday launched a drone strike against what it said was a vehicle carrying suspected Islamic State suicide bombers in Kabul. The strike killed 10 civilians, including eight children, family members and witnesses said. The drone strike was the second such American attack against Islamic State’s Afghan offshoot, following an explosion that killed 13 U.S. service members and nearly 200 Afghan civilians outside Hamid Karzai International Airport on Aug. 26. Islamic State in Afghanistan claimed responsibility for the attack.<br />The Taliban, who seized Kabul on Aug. 15, are a sworn enemy of Islamic State, and shot dead one of the group’s top leaders in Afghanistan hours after taking over the Kabul prison where he was held. Here’s a look at Islamic State’s regional affiliate in Afghanistan.<br />Islamic State Khorasan Province, also known as ISKP and by the U.S. government as ISIS-K, is an Afghanistan-based offshoot of Islamic State, the Islamist extremist group that established what it called a caliphate in Syria and Iraq in 2014 and has carried out terrorist attacks in countries around the world. The name Khorasan refers to a historical region encompassing northeast Iran, much of Afghanistan and parts of Central Asia.<br />The core membership of Islamic State Khorasan Province, founded in 2015, includes disgruntled members of the Afghan Taliban and its Pakistani counterpart, the TTP. According to analysts who track the movement, the group has also recruited heavily in Pakistani mosques and madrasas. Islamic State has conducted a string of deadly attacks in Kabul, primarily targeting members of Afghanistan’s  Shiite Hazara minority. Such attacks include, according to the U.S., an assault by gunmen on a maternity ward in Kabul in 2020, which killed 24 people, mostly women and children.<br />At the height of its strength, the group was believed by U.S. officials to number 2,000 to 3,000 fighters, but likely commands many fewer today.</td>

      <td>Entergy Corp.’s  challenge in restoring power after Hurricane Ida extends well beyond New Orleans as it repairs widespread wind damage to much of its transmission system.<br />Rod West, Entergy’s group president of utility operations, said Monday that 207 transmission lines traversing more than 2,000 miles are out of service in Louisiana and Mississippi. About 900,000 customers are without power, and the company expects the number to increase as the storm moves through Mississippi.<br />Mr. West said that the company started assessing damage Monday with drones, helicopters and workers on the ground as the storm moved away from the coast. It initially gave customers a three-week estimate for how long power restoration might take, but Mr. West said repairs could go faster—or slower—depending on location.<br />“The hard part is that the geography is a rather wide swath,” Mr. West said. “That three weeks is not going to apply to everybody the same way.”<br />He anticipates a number of transmission towers needing repairs or complete replacements. “It’ll be a mix, because this storm did not discriminate,” he said. “The kind of impact only happens when you have really significant wind that just wreaked havoc.”</td>

      <td>Shares of  Robinhood Markets Inc.  tumbled on Monday after the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission signaled that he was open to banning payment for order flow, a practice that accounts for most of the online brokerage’s revenues.<br />Robinhood shares closed 6.9% lower after Barron’s published an interview with SEC Chairman Gary Gensler in which he said a full prohibition of payment for order flow was “on the table” as part of a broader agency review.<br />Robinhood’s stock was briefly down more than 9% on Monday afternoon before recouping some of its losses. Shares of  Virtu Financial Inc.,  an electronic trading firm that handles orders from retail brokerages such as Robinhood and TD Ameritrade, also fell on the remarks. Virtu stock declined 3.8% for the day.<br />In payment for order flow, or PFOF, online brokerages take payments from high-speed trading firms in exchange for sending them their customers’ stock and options orders for execution. The trading firms profit from trading against investors’ orders by collecting a small difference between the buying and selling prices of stocks.<br />PFOF is legal and has been common in the U.S. brokerage industry for decades. But it drew renewed attention this year after the trading frenzy in  GameStop Corp.  and other meme stocks spurred scrutiny of the handling of small investors’ trades.</td>

      <td>Hate crimes in the U.S. rose about 6% last year, fueled by an increase in anti-Asian, anti-Black and antiwhite incidents, according to FBI statistics released Monday, reaching levels not seen in more than a decade.<br />State and local police reported 7,759 criminal incidents in 2020 motivated by bias, amid a global pandemic and a racial reckoning prompted by the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said. The number of such episodes last year matched levels last seen in 2008, and a rash of high-profile incidents have continued this year.<br />In March, a white gunman killed eight people at three Atlanta-area spas, including six women of Asian descent. The attack deepened nationwide conversations about racism and a recent rise in anti-Asian bigotry. The gunman pleaded guilty to some charges last month.<br />The shooter’s killing spree occurred in two different counties, giving two sets of local prosecutors jurisdiction over the crimes. One local prosecutor’s office said last month that the federal, state and local investigation didn’t find evidence of prejudice against Asians. However, another local prosecutor has said she would seek an enhanced punishment against the gunman under Georgia’s new hate-crimes law.<br />Congress passed new hate-crimes legislation in response to the wave of anti-Asian violence earlier this year. The law is designed to improve data collection around hate crimes and aims to expedite a Justice Department review of such incidents. It also requires the attorney general to issue guidance to state and local law-enforcement agencies for setting up online hate-crime reporting processes, collecting data and raising public awareness about hate crimes during the Covid-19 pandemic.</td>

While revenue for the videoconferencing company’s quarter ended July 31 came in just above Wall Street’s estimate, Zoom is no longer selling itself. Research and development costs nearly doubled in the quarter from the same period last year, while sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue also increased. Despite the added investments, the company’s guidance implied revenue growth will significantly decelerate throughout the year. Shares of Zoom fell 11% in after-hours trading immediately following its earnings report.<br />If you are planning on continuing to work from home every day for the foreseeable future, chances are that is a luxurious choice. Companies are beginning to require their employees back in the office some or all of the time. A working paper published in April by the National Bureau of Economic Research predicts 20% of full workdays will be supplied from home after the pandemic ends, up from 5% beforehand.<br />Assuming a given 52-week year offers 260 total weekdays, that works out to a roughly 300% increase in work days done at home—a figure that matters as investors try to value Zoom’s shares as it aims to go from a pandemic workaround to a workweek staple. Heading into Monday’s report, Zoom’s shares were up just 3% this year, which may appear modest given the hybrid work models many companies are pursuing.<br />But Zoom shares have returned more than 800% in the roughly 18 months from when they first started trading back in the Spring of 2019. Shares have come off their highs as vaccines have rolled out, but they are still trading 460% above where they closed in their trading debut.</td>

      <td>The Department of Education elbows into another cultural battle.</td>
      <td>The Office for Civil Rights in Education is an arm of the administrative state that has often inflamed the culture wars in the last decade. So it was only a matter of time before it jumped into America’s latest, bitter cultural conflict on the progressive side. On Monday the agency targeted states that have limited the ability of local school districts to compel students to wear masks.<br />“I write to inform you that the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is opening a directed investigation into whether the Tennessee Department of Education may be preventing school districts in the state from considering or meeting the needs of students with disabilities,” says the letter from the agency. The letter was also sent to education authorities in Utah, South Carolina, Oklahoma and Iowa.<br />The OCR has authority to revoke federal funding from institutions it deems to be violating civil-rights law. A 1973 federal law bars discrimination against students with disabilities. Because people with certain disabilities are at greater risk if infected with the coronavirus, OCR implies that states that restrict mask mandates are violating students’ civil rights.<br />What a contortion of the law. Far from being a question of civil rights, the wisdom of mask mandates, like all Covid mitigation measures, is an empirical and policy debate. Certainly no one would suggest that anti-mask policies are based on animus toward students with disabilities. Most data suggests the danger of coronavirus in children is comparable to that of the influenza virus, though the jury is still out on children and the more contagious Delta variant.<br />The OCR’s letter to the states notes that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends masking for students “age 2 and older.” Yet that measure is not cost-free: Last year Susan Hopkins, a top U.K. public-health official, recommended against masking young children because “it’s really important that they can see facial expressions in order to develop their communications and language skills.”</td>

      <td>Spending to protect against extreme weather beats green boondoggles.</td>
      <td>The pictures of Hurricane Ida’s wreckage across Louisiana are grim, and the storm isn’t over. But the good news is that New Orleans appears to have weathered the tempest as well as could be expected thanks to its post-Katrina flood-protection investments. This is a reminder of how hardening infrastructure against unpredictable Mother Nature pays off.<br />Ida slammed into Louisiana’s Port Fourchon on Sunday as a Category 4 storm with wind speeds of 150 miles an hour and one to two inches of rain an hour. Its winds tie it as the fifth strongest storm to hit the U.S. mainland. Such heavy winds and precipitation will inevitably cause flooding and damage buildings.<br />But the bigger worry going into Ida was that a catastrophic storm surge would breach New Orleans’s levees and submerge the city as happened 16 years ago to the day during Hurricane Katrina. Clocking in as a lower-grade Category 3 storm when it made landfall, Katrina killed some 2,000 people and caused an estimated $125 billion in damage. New Orleans took years to recover.<br />Yet Louisiana and the feds have since spent $14.5 billion on bolstering flood walls, levees and drainage systems. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reinforced pumping stations to withstand 205 mile-per-hour winds and established redundant power systems to operate them if the electric grid fails, as it did Sunday.<br />These investments appear to have paid off. Many streets are flooded from the heavy rainfall and some small towns outside of New Orleans’s flood-protection fortress were inundated. But more important, a Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority spokesperson on Monday said there were no levee breaches or problems with pumps in New Orleans.</td>

      <td>A day that will live in infamy as thousands are left behind.</td>
      <td>The last American troops left Kabul on Monday—before the Aug. 31 deadline as the Taliban and President Biden had insisted—ending a 20-year conflict but also diminishing the hope of escape for tens of thousands of Afghan interpreters and others who helped America. The frantic evacuation flights managed to get many out, but this was a shameful day in American history, no matter how much the White House wants to spin it otherwise.<br />Aug. 31 was the arbitrary deadline Mr. Biden set when he thought he would be able to boast on the 20th anniversary of 9/11 that he had ended a “forever war.” He refused to extend the date despite pleas from NATO allies and knowing the date was too soon to evacuate the deserving. Mr. Biden nonetheless told Americans that he would evacuate all Americans who wanted to leave.<br />His deadline meant that the evacuation failed as much as his withdrawal strategy did. An unknown number of Americans—perhaps a few hundred—weren’t able to leave on the last flights. Nonprofit groups estimate that as many as 60,000 Afghans who fought or assisted the NATO mission were left behind.<br />Many are in hiding amid reports that special Taliban squads are searching for the names on lists they may have acquired in the willy-nilly U.S. withdrawal. Many will be tortured and killed, and their families too.<br />Incredibly, Mr. Biden plans to rely on the mercy of the Taliban to get the remaining people out on commercial or charter flights. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is already laying the groundwork for this American pleading as he says that the Taliban have reason to cooperate to earn international goodwill and presumably access to foreign aid. The apt phrase for this is paying diplomatic ransom.</td>

      <td>Spending plans: $4.5 trillion. Billionaire net worth: $4.4 trillion.</td>
      <td>Bernie Sanders held a rally in Iowa over the weekend to sell his $3.5 trillion budget proposal, and he also had kind words for President Biden’s $1 trillion infrastructure plan. As usual, Mr. Sanders assailed America’s “billionaire class,” which he said is refusing to pay its “fair share” of taxes.<br />“We are living in a nation where the people on top are doing phenomenally well,” Mr. Sanders told the crowd. “They have so much money, they don’t even know what to do with it, and now some of them are off in outer space spending their billions. Well, we think maybe it might be a good idea, before you go off to outer space, to start paying attention to the struggles of working families on the ground.”<br />The trouble with this story is that Bernie has already run out of billionaires. There are 724 of them in the U.S., according to the 2021 Forbes billionaires list, released in April. At that point their collective net worth was $4.4 trillion, although that figure has presumably since risen along with the stock market.<br />But note the problem. Mr. Biden’s infrastructure plan includes about $550 billion in new spending, but the overall bill is near $1 trillion. Mr. Sanders’s budget is purportedly $3.5 trillion. Yet that number is far too low, according to analysts at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. “We estimate the policies under consideration,” they said last month, “could cost between $5 trillion and $5.5 trillion over a decade, assuming they are made permanent.” Add it all up.<br />If Mr. Sanders were to confiscate every asset of every American billionaire—Jeff Bezos’s rockets; Elon Musk’s bitcoin; Larry Ellison’s boats; Oprah Winfrey’s houses; Ted Turner’s ranches; Jay-Z’s car collection; even the starched shirt off the back of poor Larry Fink, who tied for last place on the Forbes list, at $1 billion—it still wouldn’t cover the cost of Democrats’ next two legislative plans.</td>

But if the state refuses to correct the violation, it “may put its funding from the Department of Education at risk,” the agency said.<br />In advance of schools opening for fall instruction across the country, several states have blocked K-12 schools and college campuses from requiring vaccines and masking, bucking recent federal recommendations that eligible students should be vaccinated and everyone should wear masks indoors regardless of vaccination status.</td>

      <td>Even as the last American warplanes lifted off from Kabul on Monday, there were those holding out hope that Joe Biden might yet reconsider letting the Taliban dictate the terms of our exit. These people profoundly misunderstand the president and the political equations driving his decisions.<br />For Mr. Biden, the top priority was to use the 20th anniversary of 9/11 to take a victory lap as the president who ended America’s longest war. When Kabul fell, it added a new imperative: avoid any U.S. combat casualties that would mar the moment. Even at the cost of leaving Americans behind enemy lines and abandoning our Afghan partners.<br />Critics who accuse the president of having no strategy miss the point: What we are seeing is the strategy. It is based on Mr. Biden’s confidence that no one will hold the disastrous consequences of his decisions about Afghanistan against him so long as our troops are gone.<br />Accept this and Afghanistan falls neatly into place. In July Mr. Biden assured the American people “there’s going to be no circumstance where you see people being lifted off the roof of an embassy.” Turned out plenty of folks were evacuated from our embassy in Kabul, but no helicopter dared land on the rooftop lest a photographer end up with an image too close to Saigon ’75 for the political comfort of the commander in chief.<br />Ditto for rescuing Americans in and around the city. Too great a risk of a replay of Mogadishu and another “Black Hawk Down.” So instead of sending highly trained soldiers and Marines outside the airport to do it their way and on their terms, they were largely confined to the airport while Central Intelligence Agency teams and volunteer groups brought people out.</td>

      <td>The president’s party may squeak through 2022, but America’s enemies won’t let him go so easily.</td>
      <td>As the Biden administration struggles to contain the fallout at home and abroad from the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, the president and his team still seem to hope the political pain will be short-lived, that over time the benefits of withdrawal will increasingly bolster their position.<br />Abroad, the theory runs, the withdrawal frees the U.S. from a costly distraction and enables us to focus more on China. Let Russia worry about fanatical jihadist warriors and missionaries fanning out across Central Asia with the latest American weaponry. Let China cope with the double-dealing, back-stabbing, perpetually indigent Pakistani government. Let Iran deal with newly empowered Sunni zealots, uncontrolled opium flows and a stream of refugees pressing on its frontiers.<br />At home, Bidenites hope Afghanistan will be in the rearview mirror long before the midterm elections. Swing-district Democrats can immunize themselves by criticizing the administration over the execution of the withdrawal; all Democrats will benefit from their association with a president who, however inelegantly, is ending unpopular wars rather than starting new ones.<br />These hopes are not completely unfounded, and Republicans who want to ride the Afghanistan issue back into power may be disappointed. History, however, always punishes failure. Both the Biden administration and the U.S. will pay a price for the mix of strategic fecklessness and tactical bungling that brought a 20-year stalemate to this inglorious end.<br />The Biden team has already discovered part of the price: Instead of freeing it to think about Afghanistan less, the messy withdrawal means that for the foreseeable future the White House will have to care more about what happens there but with fewer tools to manage the situation. An unknown number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents and Afghans eligible for Special Immigrant Visas will be left behind, along with their dependents. Not only the Taliban but any armed faction can trigger a political crisis in America by seizing or mistreating these vulnerable people.</td>

      <td>The ‘student swap’ creates a vicious circle that drives up higher-education costs and worsens the debt crisis.</td>
      <td>America’s public universities, designed to offer affordable college education to residents of their states, have been engaged in a “student swap.” The best of these public universities (known as flagship schools in most state systems) have been enrolling more students from other states, in turn reducing admission of the students they were established to serve. The reason is simple: money. Out-of-state students pay substantially higher tuition. The result is college that is more expensive for many, but a society that is no better educated overall.<br />In a new research report for the Brookings Institution, Ariel Gelrud Shiro and I found that 48 out of 50 flagship universities increased their share of out-of-state freshmen from 2002 to 2018. The average increase was 55%, although some, such as University of California, Berkeley, and University of Alabama, increased by more than 150%. The result is a change in the nature of many of these schools. For example, 8 of 10 University of Maine freshmen were Mainers in the fall of 2002. By 2018 that figure had fallen to 54%.<br />As public universities increasingly reject their own residents for admission, they undermine their political support. As state legislatures cut funding for higher education, schools need greater numbers of tuition-paying out-of-state students to increase revenue. Our research didn’t uncover who started this cycle, but we find evidence that the more a state school reduced its in-state student share, the less support it received from its state government.<br />A few states have solved the problem. North Carolina is one of two states that aren’t part of this swap. The General Assembly passed a law mandating that at least 82% of North Carolina public university students be in-state residents. Thus, UNC Chapel Hill has remained at 82%, while keeping its extremely prestigious and selective school status. UNC Chapel Hill has also maintained its level of support from North Carolina, while most states have seen higher education funding substantially eroded.<br />Under Gov. George W. Bush, Texas adopted a different approach in the 1990s, mandating automatic acceptance for all Texas high-school students graduating in the top 10% of their class. While that figure has been adjusted down to 6% as student population growth has outstripped space, UT Austin’s freshman class was 89% Texan in 2018, while the school continues to maintain an excellent reputation. So much for the argument that increasing reliance on out-of-staters is about maintaining a higher ranking.</td>

      <td>If you wanted to capture the geopolitical history of the 21st century so far in a single paragraph, you couldn’t do much better than this:<br />Twenty years ago, America fought a brief and successful military campaign to oust from power the people who had enabled a terrorist organization to kill as many American citizens as have ever died at the hands of a foreign power in a single day in the nation’s history. A month shy of two decades later, the U.S. pleaded with that same power not to harm its soldiers, its citizens and their allies as it scrambled to complete a chaotic and humiliating retreat that left that former enemy—and American adversaries everywhere—immeasurably stronger.<br />Any story of nemesis has its roots in hubris, and there’s much hubris to go around in the 20 years of American engagement with Afghanistan.<br />But as a lesson in the tragic cost of vanity, not much can top the spectacle we have witnessed in the past few weeks: an administration so steeped in self-belief, so driven by self-confidence, so disastrously misled by the vain order it imagined it could impose on the world; a hubris now paid for not in a high-level resignation or even an expression of contrition, but in the lives of American troops, lions again sacrificed to save the faces of the donkeys who lead them.<br />Biden hubris is a perfect example of the genre: the team of strategic geniuses, lauded by their fellow so-called experts, by allies and above all by themselves, as the smartest guys in the room, the “grown-ups” back to clear up the mess left by those terrible naïfs who preceded them.</td>

      <td>‘We should look at the calamitous blunderings in Afghanistan as an opportunity to demand a true turning point.’</td>
      <td>Former Sen. Jim Webb (D., Va.) writing for the National Interest, Aug. 29:<br /><br />In a perverse way, perhaps we should look at the calamitous blunderings in Afghanistan as an opportunity to demand a true turning point. Americans know that a great deal of our governmental process is now either institutionally corrupt or calcified. . . .<br />Even the very best among those who come forward to serve often find that the good they came to do is stultified by distracting debates over the very premise of why the American system of government was created and whether the icons of our past were truly motivated by the words incorporated in our most revered documents. The military itself is increasingly being used by leftist activists as a social laboratory to advance extreme political agendas. Congressional oversight leans heavily toward social issues, with too many members struggling without success to focus on accountability at the very top when, for instance, good people at the bottom have to implement poorly conceived plans that might kill them.</td>

      <td>The U.S. Navy’s dominance brought order to the oceans and fostered global trade. How much longer will that continue?</td>
      <td>The U.S. Navy hasn’t fought at sea in nearly 80 years. Few Americans were even alive when Ernest Evans, a Navy destroyer captain who died in the 1944 Battle of Leyte Gulf, said to his crew on the USS Johnston: “This is going to be a fighting ship. I intend to go in harm’s way”—a line now famous in the Navy. The public has grown accustomed to peace, not fighting, on the seas.<br />But that tranquility is an anomaly in world history, won and maintained at a cost. Gregg Easterbrook’s “The Blue Age: How the U.S. Navy Created Global Prosperity—And Why We’re in Danger of Losing It” is a useful primer for Americans who have only a foggy understanding of why the U.S. invests in naval power.<br />The U.S. Navy is “the police force of nearly all blue water,” the Washington-based journalist Mr. Easterbrook writes, and one result has been an explosion in global living standards. The Strait of Malacca, a narrow stretch of ocean between Malaysia and Sumatra, was for centuries among the most treacherous passages on the globe; it is now, Mr. Easterbrook says, the shipping equivalent of a Los Angeles freeway. The American Navy “has made the oceans impassable for those bent on war, while safer for commerce,” resulting in trade that benefits “almost everyone.” He is right that this arrangement is fragile and underappreciated, and that everything from undersea internet cables to power conduits depends on the free seas.<br />Mr. Easterbrook neatly sets out the benefits of international trade, most of which happens on the seas. The left-right alliance symbolized by Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump keeps Americans aware of the costs of free trade and largely ignorant of its blessings. “Globalization,” a reality made possible by safe oceans, is blamed for cultural decline, political polarization and much else. Another inconvenient reality that seldom informs trade politics: “The American middle class is shrinking because most who exit are ascending toward the upper middle.”<br />Mr. Easterbrook is by nature an optimist—his 2018 book “It’s Better Than It Looks” sought to debunk the habitual declinism of modern American commentary. In “The Blue Age” he dazzles readers with inventories of American naval superiority. “The United States has eleven nuclear supercarriers” compared with “none for the rest of the world.” China’s two carriers employ a “ski jump” for launching planes, a primitive technology compared with American aircraft catapults. Russia’s single in-use carrier is a floating “rust bucket” that on one jaunt had to divert some of its own pilots to land elsewhere. He praises the “forward-deployed” model that parks American ships in neighborhoods across the world. “Land and air forces can win disputes,” a retired admiral tells Mr. Easterbrook, “but it is the navy that keeps disputes far from our shores.”</td>

Yet they said the priority should remain increasing vaccinations of unvaccinated people, and that boosters shouldn’t distract or impede from doing that.<br />When giving boosters, some panel members added, the priority should be preventing severe disease in people at highest risk of becoming sick with Covid-19, as opposed to preventing infections.<br />“It would be important for us to focus our efforts on preventing severe disease because variants are going to continue to emerge over time and will evade our ability to prevent all infections,” said Grace Lee, ACIP’s chairwoman, who is a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at Stanford University.<br />The group said it intended to vote on formally recommending boosters after they are cleared by the Food and Drug Administration and would reconvene soon to discuss additional data about their efficacy.</td>

      <td>State’s so-called fetal-heartbeat law is set to go into effect this week</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Abortion providers filed an emergency request with the Supreme Court on Monday seeking to prevent a Texas law that bans the procedure after approximately six weeks of pregnancy from going into effect.<br />The state law, signed by Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in May, says a physician can’t knowingly perform an abortion if there is a detectable fetal heartbeat, which the law defines to include cardiac activity in the embryo that appears about six weeks into a pregnancy.<br />The law, set to take effect on Sept. 1, has an unusual feature that could complicate court proceedings. Texas lawmakers barred state officials from directly enforcing the measure, effectively deputizing the public to do it instead. The Texas law allows for private civil lawsuits in which members of the public can sue—and collect at least $10,000 in damages—from any person who allegedly performs or aids a banned abortion, or who intends to do so.<br />Abortion-rights supporters say state lawmakers designed the measure this way to make it more difficult to bring a court challenge against a ban that would be unconstitutional under current Supreme Court precedent.<br />In a bid to invalidate the ban, a group of providers and abortion-rights advocates in July sued several state officials and a private citizen who had expressed interest in bringing litigation to enforce the abortion law. The Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, without detailed explanation, has halted trial-court proceedings in the case for now and declined to block the ban from going into effect.</td>

      <td>Retail traders have helped push the technical-support company’s stock up more than 1,500% in 2021</td>
      <td>Individual investors have found their next short-squeeze target in little-known software company  Support.com Inc.<br />Shares of the company have more than tripled in the past week, pushing the stock to finish Monday at $36.39. That gives Support.com, a technical- and customer-support provider, a 38% gain for the day and a more than 1,500% jump for the year.<br />Some retail traders are piling into Support.com, scooping up shares and placing bullish wagers on the stock. One of the reasons why: Support.com has elevated interest from bearish investors known as short sellers. Investors on social-media platforms have recently discussed the potential for setting up a short squeeze.<br />Short sellers are investors who bet against a company by borrowing shares and selling them, hoping they can buy them back later at a lower price. But these short sellers can be burned by such wagers when the stock rises. They are then forced to buy back stock to try to limit their losses. Buying more stock can put further pressure on the stock price in what is known as a short squeeze.<br />This year, individual investors have crowded into companies with elevated levels of short-selling activity, as part of a larger strategy to reap big gains and turn upside down a market that many say has long been stacked against them. More than 20 million new retail brokerage accounts are estimated to have been created since the start of 2020, according to JMP Securities. Most notably, individual investors have tried to force short squeezes in companies including  GameStop Corp.  and  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.  this year. They have also driven higher stocks ranging from car-rental company  Hertz Global Holdings Inc.  to laser-scanning technology firm  MicroVision Inc.</td>

You’re one of us.”<br />Mr. Amin would still need to get through the crowds and past the security checkpoint at Abbey Gate. Mr. Darlington also gave him a plan for that: Carry a sign with the numbers “1,2,3,4” on it. That was a code for Marines at the gate to expedite his path.<br />The Amins almost made it. But as they neared the checkpoint last Thursday, a suicide bomber detonated 25 pounds of explosives, killing Mr. Amin, his wife and more than 200 others, including 13 Americans, most of them Marines.</td>

      <td>The jazz pianist’s new album was conceived during the Covid-19 lockdown, when she was stuck at home instead of touring globally.</td>
      <td><br />On the cover of her new album, “Kinds of Love” (Smoke Sessions), due Sept. 3, the fashion-forward Renee Rosnes is perched on the arm of a club chair dressed in a striking silver and royal-blue suit. At first glance, the jazz pianist appears to be having a “Green Acres” moment. The chair seems stacked with bales of hay, while the sawdust-toned floor and grainy wood paneling behind her hint at a sleek barn setting.<br />Not a chance. The chair was designed by Ms. Rosnes’s nephew, Aaron Aujla; the photo was shot at Green River Project, her nephew’s design studio in New York; and the “hay” is raffia—leaves from an African palm tree that serve as the chair’s upholstery. As for the suit, it was made for Ms. Rosnes by trend-setting designer Emily Adams Bode, who’s engaged to Mr. Aujla.<br />Married to the celebrated jazz pianist Bill Charlap, Ms. Rosnes has long been an acclaimed pianist in her own right. Known for her forceful and exotically intense music, she has released 19 studio albums as a leader since 1989 and recorded as a sidewoman on many others, including ones by legacy jazz artists such as Little Jimmy Scott, J.J. Johnson and Bobby Hutcherson.<br />In 2017, she formed Artemis, an all-female, all-star septet that features Ms. Rosnes, clarinetist Anat Cohen, tenor saxophonist Melissa Aldana, trumpeter Ingrid Jensen, bassist Noriko Ueda, drummer Allison Miller and vocalist Cécile McLorin Salvant. The supergroup released its first album in 2020 and is planning a second.</td>

Advocacy groups said as many as 60,000 Afghan interpreters, drivers and others who assisted the U.S. military, CIA and U.S. diplomatic personnel over the years, along with their families, remain in the country, at risk of retribution from the Taliban.<br />The last flight of U.S. military personnel departed Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport at 3:29 p.m. Eastern time, Gen. Frank McKenzie, commander of U.S. Central Command, said Monday.</td>
