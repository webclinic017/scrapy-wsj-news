President Biden’s words resonated when he claimed that “America is 13th in the world in infrastructure.”<br />Included in the bipartisan package are broadband-deployment subsidies. Mr. Biden asked for $100 billion. The Republicans and Democrats compromised at $65 billion in the “Infrastructure 1” package. Most of that, $42 billion, is slotted for subsidies to rural communications networks, promising to conquer the “digital divide.”</td>

What employers should really care about, however, is an employee’s alertness level while performing the job. This holds true all the more so for employees in safety-sensitive jobs such as tower repair, where a lack of alertness could result in death.<br />Marijuana use is only one of many factors affecting employee alertness. Others are poor sleep, anxiety and changes in prescribed medications, to name a few. I think employers will be better served by exploring ways to assess an employee’s alertness regardless of the cause. If employees aren’t as mentally alert as they normally are, employers should help them address it before they get behind the wheel or fire up that chainsaw.</td>

Just as Mr. Guillen arrived at Christianity during his doctoral studies by debunking core tenets of his atheistic worldview, I left Christianity by studying the New Testament, not through the lens of faith, but in graduate and postgraduate settings through the lens of the historical-critical method of biblical scholarship. It raises questions about the authorship and authenticity of scripture.<br />For me, the paucity of extrabiblical evidence for even the existence of Jesus, let alone the historical-critical problems with his alleged resurrection, led me to abandon my faith (and career as a Baptist minister), a faith that had been foundational since childhood.</td>

Nonetheless, what we saw last week was an unconditional surrender by President Joe Biden to the demands of his party’s left wing. He’ll set the bipartisan infrastructure bill aside until Sen. Bernie Sanders’ $5.5 trillion welfare state expansion is signed into law. (The usual estimate of $3.5 trillion assumes its programs will be allowed to expire, which they won’t.)<br />Mr. Biden’s capitulation was utterly unnecessary. He vanquished the Democratic left in the 2020 South Carolina primary, with 49% to Mr. Sanders’s 20% and won a majority of the convention delegates by June 5, even before the last eight states and three territories held primaries.</td>

Xi Jinping may manage to prevent the burst of the real estate bubble, but China’s economy isn’t heading for more-sustainable growth. Evergrande’s woes are a reminder that China’s political economy under Mr. Xi has become even more unstable, even as Beijing grows more impatient to displace America as the dominant power. Time is not on China’s side.<br />The global financial crisis that began with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 led to a severe liquidity crunch as financial institutions lost faith in the capacity of one another and commercial firms to repay their loans. China’s financial system doesn’t work this way. Loss of faith in the commercial worthiness of other entities isn’t fatal. Instead, banks and other financial institutions unfailingly lend if instructed to do so by political masters.</td>

In November 1688, a largely Dutch army of 24,000 landed at Torbay in Devonshire, and within a few months its commander—William, Prince of Orange—was king of England. Some might say that this was not really an invasion: first because William had come at the invitation of opposition politicians who had urged him to depose James II and restore “the liberties of England”; and second because there was no battle, most of James’s generals having crossed over to William. There were, however, battles in Scotland and Ireland. The so-called Glorious Revolution was also termed a “bloodless” one, but only in England and not throughout the British Isles.<br />William would reign from 1689 to 1702, jointly with his wife, Mary (James’s daughter), until her death in 1694 and then on his own. He is the hero of Macaulay’s “History of England,” for having led the country (as Macaulay saw it) away from James’s despotism and toward a securely parliamentary monarchy. Yet William is little remembered in England today, despite a fine equestrian statue of him in St. James’s Square.</td>

Unfortunately for financial markets, they will be pulling back at the same time, setting up 2022 as the year of the “taper tandem”—the fastest liquidity drain in a decade.<br />Monetary data indicate that advanced economies are awash in money, thanks to central banks’ voracious buying of financial assets. In March 2020, amid financial panic over Covid-19, the New York Fed was creating money to buy up to $75 billion of assets every day. Around the same time, the ECB announced an emergency program targeting €1.85 trillion ($2.15 trillion) of purchases in total. Plentiful liquidity helped governments, businesses and households survive lockdowns. Cash flows collapsed but bankruptcies barely increased.

      <td>Across three years in the Cold War ’50s, God, as never before, became part of the grammar of American daily life. In 1954, Congress passed a bipartisan amendment to the 1942 wartime flag code that added two words to our existing pledge of allegiance, our “nation indivisible” seeing “under God” inserted between them; in 1955, Congress unanimously voted to replace our de facto motto, E pluribus unum—Out of many, one—with “In God We Trust”; and in 1956, legislated that every piece of U.S. currency minted or printed thereafter would feature, prominently, our theistic motto. Thus kindergartners of the 1960s became the first generation of American public-school children to whom it would be unknown not to recite, every morning, a pledge overseen by a creator, children whose every nickel saved or squandered on bubble gum and Creamsicles or, later, prostitutes and bags of pot, would be underwritten by an implicitly Christian Lord. By the time John Lennon sang, in 1970, “God is a concept / by which we measure our pain,” he was nondenominationally describing our metaphysical condition, but he was also dismantling a myth that sought to bind one American to another, one which, as never before, was tearing us apart.<br />In the rift between secularism and churchgoing, Jonathan Franzen has set his sixth and latest novel, “Crossroads,” the first in what promises to be three linked novels under the broad banner “A Key to All Mythologies” (the title alludes to “Middlemarch” and an uncompleted work of Christian philosophy by that book’s insufferable Rev. Casaubon). Like all Mr. Franzen’s novels, “Crossroads” burrows into the walls behind which a group of people endure the particularly excruciating form of self-flagellation we call family life. The Probsts, the Hollands, the Lamberts, the Berglunds, the Tylers: Mr. Franzen’s fictional families from his earlier novels are now joined by the Hildebrandts, very unhappy in their own way, and very conflicted in their relationships with Mainline Protestant ideas of “goodness.”</td>

One potential investor concern is that a merger might be driven in part by executive compensation since bigger bank bosses tend to be paid more, notes Autonomous Research analyst Brian Foran. It can also be tough to independently measure whether cost-savings projections actually materialize partly because conditions for banks, such as interest rates or the direction of markets, are constantly in flux. As for the stocks: A recent McKinsey & Co. study found that among 58 midcap bank mergers from 2010 to 2021, only 17 merged institutions’ returns outperformed peers over the two years postdeal.</td>

      <td>Offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico produces more crude oil in 2.8 days than the West Coast produces in an entire year. But a few decades ago, California’s coastline was humming with activity. In 1995, the West Coast produced 92 million barrels from California’s offshore reserves, according to estimates by the Energy Information Administration. By 2019, that number had plummeted to 13 million.<br />In 2020, offshore federal production accounted for 15% of all crude-oil production, most of it from the Gulf of Mexico. California is part of the third-largest U.S. oil-producing region, PADD 5, which also includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon and Washington, as well as the Pacific Outer continental shelf.  There are currently 23 oil-and-gas production facilities in federal waters, installed between the late 1960s and 1990. There are four more platforms in California’s waters.</td>

An extensive data set from late 2019—more than 9,000 hospital samples—is available of people exhibiting flulike (thus Covid-like) symptoms in China’s Hubei and Shaanxi provinces before the epidemic started. Based on SARS-1 and MERS, the natural zoonotic theory predicts 100 to 400 Covid infections would be found in those samples. The lab-leak hypothesis, of course, predicts zero. If the novel coronavirus were engineered by scientists pursuing gain-of-function research, there would be no instances of community infection until it escaped from the laboratory. The World Health Organization investigation analyzed those stored samples and found zero pre-pandemic infections. This is powerful evidence favoring the lab-leak theory.</td>

The development by American oil and gas companies of new horizontal drilling techniques and the perfection of the process of hydraulic fracturing were key elements in this turnaround.

Without additional privacy measures, central bankers shouldn’t establish them.<br />You are likely familiar with privately issued digital dollars, such as electronic balances in checking accounts. Central bank digital currencies are similar, except the liability is on the central bank, rather than private banks. One benefit of tying digital currencies to a central bank is that payments would also be processed by central banks, strengthening national and international payments systems and potentially lowering transaction costs. They could also address economic inequality by offering the “unbanked” a way to access the financial system via a direct account with the central bank.</td>

      <td>Lawmakers consider trims to package of child care, education and health programs</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Democrats wrestled Tuesday with how to squeeze their wish list of programs and tax changes into a social policy and climate package whose size and scope centrists in the party are willing to support.<br />President Biden acknowledged in a series of meetings with Democrats this week and on Friday that a package once pegged at $3.5 trillion would have to be smaller, given opposition from centrist Senate Democrats to a bill of that magnitude. Now, they are grappling with the tougher next step: deciding exactly how much narrower—and which of—their proposed child care, education or health programs would have to get trimmed or culled.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden traveled to Michigan Tuesday to build public support for his agenda, pitching it as a necessary investment for the U.S. to remain competitive, as Congress wrestles with two legislative packages stacked with his priorities.<br />Mr. Biden visited a union facility in Howell, Mich., to talk up a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package that passed the Senate in August and is waiting for a vote in the House. Progressives say they won’t vote for the proposal unless lawmakers reach a deal on a second, larger set of proposals, including new spending on healthcare, education and child care.</td>

      <td>This CBS comedy about the diverse spirits haunting an upstate manor is scary good.</td>
      <td>There are certainly no shows on TV more spirited than “Ghosts” right now and there may be none funnier. Making its debut with two episodes Thursday night, the show concerns a young couple, Jay and Sam (Utkarsh Ambudkar and Rose McIver), who inherit a rambling, ramshackle, 300-year-old mansion in upstate New York. No strings. No tax burden. Free. “There’s gotta be something wrong with it,” says Jay—at which point we already know enough to chuckle.<br />The “wrong” at the Woodstone Estate, from which Sam’s great-aunt Sophie has recently departed (in what turns out to be a relatively conventional, ascended-into-heaven manner), is the octet of apparitions Sophie has left behind. The souls of the not-at-all-recently departed. They include Isaac (Brandon Scott Jones), a Revolutionary War-era soldier who died an inglorious death (“dysentery was no party”); a flamboyant ’20s jazz singer named Alberta (Danielle Pinnock), who may have been murdered; a sardonic Native-American, Sasappis (Román Zaragoza); a hippie named Flower (Sheila Carrasco); and a cod-obsessed Viking named Thorfinn (Devan Chandler Long). Sophie’s death leaves the fate of the house, and the comfort of its inhabitants, up in the air. What will the new owners do with the place? What will the ghosts do? Rest in peace? Think again.</td>

      <td>From affordable options on Amazon to easy DIY creations, costumes from Netflix’s hit South Korean show ‘Squid Game’ are sure to be inescapable this Halloween.</td>
      <td>“Squid Game,” the South Korean dystopian thriller which debuted on  Netflix  on Sept. 17, is on track to be the platform’s biggest hit to date. With Halloween on the horizon, the tremendously popular show has also spawned an onslaught of “Squid Game” costumes. On  Amazon.com ,  you’ll find over 2,000 results for the term “Squid Game costume.” Google trends, the search engine’s in-house platform that tracks user interest, reported that for the week ending October 2, searches for “Squid Game costume” reached a new high. And though the holiday is still weeks away, Instagram users are already giddily posting their themed outfits with the hashtag #SquidGameCostume.<br />The scripted show’s costumes are blissfully simple. In “Squid Game,” financially troubled contestants play traditional Korean children’s games on a secluded island, vying for a cash prize. Losers are promptly killed. The desperate contestants who compete in the show’s twisted game all wear  basic white slip-on sneakers and forest-green tracksuits with their assigned numbers stitched on the left side. The pinkish-red jumpsuits worn by the show’s menacing guards are even less intricate.</td>
