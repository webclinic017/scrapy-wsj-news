To fill in the picture, the FGA sent records requests to individual states, whose errors are sampled on a rotating cycle. The group’s report cites figures for about a dozen. Top of the list was Ohio, with a bad payment rate of 44.3%. Illinois, a usual suspect, came in at 37.3%. Missouri was 31.7% and North Dakota 28.3%.

Mr. Schwab wanted business executives, government officials and nonprofit leaders to discuss his idea of “stakeholder capitalism”: the concept that corporate managers have a duty to pursue the interests not only of shareholders, but of stakeholders. What’s a stakeholder? Basically, it’s any individual or group allegedly affected by the company’s decisions.<br />The idea caught on. Fifty years later, around 3,000 billionaires and millionaires, heads of state, rock stars, and hangers-on flock to the annual gathering. (The 2021 Forum was held remotely, and this year’s meeting has been delayed until spring.) The language of stakeholder capitalism permeates politics and economics. Mr. Schwab did more than build an institution. He created a social type: the globe-trotting, well-connected, extremely wealthy do-gooder whom the late political scientist Samuel P. Huntington called “Davos Man.”</td>

On the contrary, it dismisses the positive example of Canada’s dairy supply-management program, which has stabilized the supply of milk, provided protective subsidies to small farmers, ensured most of the dairy production is consumed domestically and offered fairer prices to farmers and consumers.<br />Canada’s quota system has enabled dairy farmers to invest in more sustainable, climate-friendly farming practices. Their average dairy herd size is 97 cows, allowing more opportunities for pasture grazing and soil carbon sequestration. This combination of minimal emissions and maximum soil carbon retention constitutes one of the most positive versions of dairy production.</td>

      <td>Middle age is a crowded time. It’s also a lonely one. Work and family demands leave little time for nurturing friendships, particularly for women.<br />Pre-pandemic, conversations about loneliness often centered on men, with talk of a “loneliness epidemic.” But during lockdown, Generation X women, who range in age from 41 to 57 years old, reported the sharpest rise in loneliness, according to a survey of more than 1,000 adults conducted in the spring of 2020 by the Roots of Loneliness Project, a research organization. And the increase in social isolation reported by women living with children was also greatest among those from Gen X, according to an unpublished portion of the survey shared with The Wall Street Journal.</td>

But on Wednesday night, 48 out of 50 Senate Democrats voted to use the “nuclear option” in an attempt to overturn election laws in most states.<br />That means the partisan abolition of the Senate’s 60-vote requirement for most legislation is no longer an abstraction. It’s an institutional Democratic Party position—a trigger that Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has committed to pull as soon as he has 50 votes and a co-partisan as Vice President. Democrats may have failed to ram their legislation through this week, but they have changed the nature of the U.S. Senate merely by trying to make it a majoritarian body for the first time.

Some of the nation’s more agreeable qualities are evident there: courtesy and fairness, honesty, a capacity for innovation, hard work, intellectual adventure and responsibility. . . . Minnesotans are remarkably civil; their crime rate is the third lowest in the nation (after Iowa and Maine).”</td>

What possessed people to buy his albums and make “Bat Out of Hell,” his monstrous, melodramatic concept album of 1977, one of the biggest-selling rock albums of all time?<br />You either got it or you didn’t, and if you got it, you got the lot. Meat Loaf embodied rock ’n’ roll in all its promise and decay. The passions of youth wobbled within a body run to seed; the simple pleasures of Elvis in the youth of his golden Sun recordings flowered into the sickly extravagance of Elvis in his lusting, swollen Vegas dotage. We never, as Meat Loaf sang on his epic signature song “Bat Out of Hell,” “see the sudden curve before it’s way too late.” The arc of the music, the arc of a life.</td>

      <td>Software giant would have to address workplace problems at videogame maker and big gap between the companies’ ESG disclosures and policies</td>
      <td>Microsoft Corp.  could have its work cut out getting  Activision Blizzard Inc.’s  sustainability programs up to its own standards if its planned $75 billion acquisition of the videogame maker goes ahead.<br />Microsoft has developed environmental, social and governance policies over many years, including numerous environmental and workplace-diversity disclosures, and plans to compensate for all its historical greenhouse-gas emissions. Activision lags far behind, disclosing much less ESG information and having far fewer policies in place. If the deal goes through, it could take years for Microsoft to bring Activision into line with its practices, experts said.</td>
