      <td>We make sense of our psychic disturbances by relying on belief systems that are part of our lived experience, if not always objectively true.</td>
      <td>For a philosopher and historian of ideas, the observation that “life can interrupt one’s best efforts at contemplating it from a safe distance” sounds like a lament. But for Noga Arikha, an associate fellow at the Warburg Institute, it also came to express an opportunity. When she started work on “The Ceiling Outside”—an investigation of the science and experience of “the disrupted mind”—the closest she got to her subject was what she could glean from sitting in on neuropsychiatric consultations at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital in Paris. Within months, however, dementia meant that her own mother—the poet Anne Atik—had become one of the hospital’s patients. Indeed, the author’s mother becomes a recurring character in this extraordinary exploration of selfhood, which blends humane sensitivity with acute philosophical insight. The book’s title comes from her mother as well. “The ceiling inside, the ceiling outside,” she says one day, cheerfully if gnomically.<br />While interweaving her mother’s story, Ms. Arikha builds her chapters around individual case studies, evoking the work of Oliver Sacks (“The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat”), among others. She gently advances the thesis, more by showing than by telling, that “the sense of self is profoundly anchored in our body” and that this embodied self doesn’t exist without other people. She asserts that “the mind is inherently relational, not isolated,” and her six pages of acknowledgments suggest that she means what she says.</td>

The immediate effects would be massively higher prices at the pump, further collapse of the Democrats’ bleak prospects at the polls, disruption of the crown prince’s modernization agenda, and a greatly emboldened axis of Russia, China and Iran. Both Iran and Russia, with China their silent partner, have strong incentives—and real capabilities—to make this scenario a reality and force the world to lift embargoes against their oil sales.</td>

The Health and Human Services Department’s so-called antiracism plan attempts to inject identity politics into the doctor-patient relationship. This policy was in the news last week when Secretary Xavier Becerra denied that HHS had “antiracism policies” and attributed a lawmaker’s question about it to “mis- and disinformation.”<br />I know better. In February a colleague told me there was a new way to boost my Medicare reimbursement rate.

And when the following shot in a documentary actually shows a snake slithering out of its subject’s storage locker, you can assume someone behind the camera has a pretty mischievous sense of humor.<br />“The Big Conn,” a likable, four-part AppleTV+ series, tells the story of Eric C. Conn, who masterminded what is probably the biggest rip-off in the history of the Social Security Administration—$550 million, gained through fraudulently processed disability claims out of eastern Kentucky. Is it a Robin Hood story? Not overtly. But Conn is a charming rogue; the people who profited from his long-running and very lucrative scheme weren’t necessarily not entitled to the money; and as one accomplice told a Wall Street Journal reporter, “A lot of people around here don’t have more than a fourth-grade education and couldn’t get a job if their lives depended on it.” Without actually going there, directors James Lee Hernandez and Brian Lazarte—the makers of another entertaining/enlightening scamster story (“McMillion$”)—look to find some fun in fungible morality, without ignoring the fact that there were victims involved.</td>

      <td>Colin Firth stars in the HBO Max series, the latest to examine Michael Peterson’s treatment at the hands of the American justice system.</td>
      <td>The story has surfaced and resurfaced for the better part of 20 years, but the latest version of “The Staircase” gets off to a rollicking start with that most engaging of plot devices—bloody murder. Or is it? That’s been the question since Michael Peterson found his wife, Kathleen, at the bottom of a flight of stairs, or put her there, and launched a case that would serve as an autopsy of American justice.<br />The French thought so anyway. Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, who had won the Best Documentary Oscar for 2001’s “Murder on a Sunday Morning,” was intrigued by the idea of following another dubious case of Southern American jurisprudence and started filming his original “Staircase” before Peterson’s 2003 trial in North Carolina even had begun. Lestrade is a character here (played by Vincent Vermignon), as is his producer Denis Poncet (Frank Feys), which emphasizes that “The Staircase” has always been a story about the telling of stories—to a jury, to the press, to ourselves, to each other. The fact that Poncet and Lestrade disagree about Peterson’s guilt is reflective of the polarized atmosphere of the piece; the knowing glances they share when something notably outrageous is committed by the Peterson prosecution is probably more of a tipoff than we need about the sentiments of this or any other “Staircase.”</td>

      <td>Recently this column noted that student journalists at Stanford University were shining a light on a well-paid education professor at the school who’s been helping to water down California’s K-12 math standards. Now another professor at Stanford—one who’s actually in the math department— has examined the research used to justify the new K-12 standards and finds serious flaws. Stanford math professor Brian Conrad reports “many misrepresentations.”<br />The effort to change Golden State math instruction had already encountered serious opposition. A Journal editorial in December noted a public statement from hundreds of the country’s top quantitative scientists warning about the assault on math in schools:</td>

That exceeded Wall Street’s projections and beat the net additions reported by its main streaming competitors so far this earnings season. HBO Max picked up just over 3 million domestic subscribers during the first quarter while Peacock added 4 million.

      <td>Between raw material inflation, delayed deliveries and slow permitting, the U.S. solar industry was already starting the year with some speed bumps. Now, a tariff case has brought the industry to a halt.<br />On Sunday, a group of senators sent a letter to President Biden asking to speed up a solar tariff case that has prompted outcries from the industry. In late March, the Commerce Department started an investigation into whether Chinese solar producers are illegally circumventing solar tariffs by routing their operations through Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia. The four countries made up at least 80% of U.S. solar imports in 2020, and because the vast majority of manufacturers in those countries are Chinese companies, the ruling would affect only slightly less than that percentage, according to Pol Lezcano, solar analyst at BloombergNEF. The trigger was a request from Auxin Solar, a small solar manufacturer based in California.</td>

Partly it was his writing skills: When he was excited about a film, he expressed his enchantment; when he had to skewer someone, he applied the knife with literary finesse. Mostly it was because Mr. Morgenstern satisfied the main purpose of film critics: finding films the reader would like to see. If he enjoyed a film, there was a 95% chance I would like it, too. On the flip side, Mr. Morgenstern spared me from wasting many hours on unworthy films. Farewell, Joe, and thank you.</td>

When it does rain, it will tend to be torrential, resulting in flooding that we aren’t equipped to capture in reservoirs or aquifers. The real challenge is the development of massive desalination capacity to refill reservoirs and aquifers, combined with new infrastructure to capture and transport torrential rainfall.<br />Larry Isacson</td>

      <td>In 2018, Queen Elizabeth II and Anna Wintour were photographed laughing in the front row of a Richard Quinn fashion show in London—just two rather powerful grannies chatting it up. For the longest-reigning British monarch, now 96, this was a rare fashion-week outing, but for the longest-reigning editor-in-chief of American Vogue, now 72, it was business as usual. Vogue’s top editor since 1988 and the global chief content officer of Condé Nast since 2020, Ms. Wintour is no stranger to the lonely, queenlike feeling of being at the top. With typical understatement, she later told former Vanity Fair editor and sometime rival Tina Brown that at the show, she and the Queen discussed “how long we’ve both been in our jobs.”<br />Like the Queen, part of Ms. Wintour’s status as an object of fascination lies in her pure longevity. From last night’s starry “Gilded-Age”–themed Met Gala (to which she wore a tiara that’s a family heirloom), which she’s hosted since 1995, to her continual promotions at notoriously fickle Condé Nast amidst decades of cultural shifts, she is just as powerful as ever. “Anna,” a biography by journalist Amy Odell which is out today from Gallery Books, seeks to explain her omnipotence.</td>

Speedy delivery is crucial. The Russians are “at least several days behind where they wanted to be” in their new offensive, a U.S. defense official said late last week.

Russia, Prussia and Austria once devoured Poland completely. The Ottomans seized Eastern Europe and Egypt.

In a 1995 interview, veteran diplomat John Edgar Williams recalled that in 1953 the test took 3½ days and covered everything from astronomy to zoology. When I started taking it in the 1990s, it took three hours and consisted of a job knowledge section along with the kind of general questions contestants answer on “Jeopardy!,” an English grammar and usage section, and an essay, which wasn’t graded unless you met the cut-off score. In a typical year, 10,000 to 20,000 people take the exam and 2% to 3% of those are hired. The test expires after 18 months; I passed several times before I was offered a job in 2001.</td>

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has already helped craft an international agreement signed by more than 130 countries. Congress now needs to do its part and lock it in.<br />The two approaches to international taxation are worldwide taxation, in which a corporation’s home country taxes its entire global income, and territorial taxation, in which income is taxed only by the country where it is earned. Neither system is perfect, and both inevitably create some distortions.</td>

The law had bipartisan support and its guiding purpose—prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex in educational institutions—was so uncontroversial that the New York Times gave the story a mere sentence of coverage. Fast forward a few decades: Title IX is one of the most consequential domestic laws of our time, a lightning rod of controversy and a textbook example of the way our regulatory apparatus can make an Orwellian muddle out of noble ideals.<br />The bill’s 50th anniversary would seem to be a good time to reflect on this troubling evolution. Alas, journalist-activist Sherry Boschert’s “37 Words: Title IX and Fifty Years of Fighting Sex Discrimination” doesn’t show much interest in the law’s profound and unexpected effects. Her indifference will not reassure anyone uneasy about the so-called administrative state—the vast unelected bureaucracy that has given us, among much else, the current iteration of Title IX regulations.</td>

      <td>Warren Buffett’s right-hand man says the ‘unraveling’ of the trading platform after last year’s boom is a sign ‘God is getting just’</td>
      <td>Charlie Munger’s opinion of  Robinhood  Markets Inc. hasn’t improved in the past year. If anything, it has become more negative.<br />The vice chairman of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  blasted the trading platform while addressing thousands of shareholders at the company’s annual gathering in Omaha, Neb., on Saturday. He said Robinhood is losing ground since going public in July 2021.</td>

      <td>President López Obrador threatens to jail opponents of his energy agenda.</td>
      <td>President Biden met virtually with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador on Friday to talk about bilateral and regional issues, according to the White House. Diplomatic gibberish aside, the priority of the call was clear: Both presidents are harmed politically by the mess at the southern U.S. border and want it to go away.<br />Let’s be honest, though. That’s about the extent of their shared goals.</td>

      <td>The Disinformation Governance Board already looks like a partisan instrument.</td>
      <td>The Department of Homeland Security has announced the formation of the Disinformation Governance Board—charged, according to Politico, with “countering misinformation related to homeland security, focused specifically on irregular migration and Russia.” In a twist too implausible for fiction, the abbreviation is DGB, one letter off from KGB.<br />The stated goal of combating mis- and disinformation is framed to seem unobjectionable. Who objects to truth and pines for falsehood? DGB experts will guide the way, separating the informational wheat from the disinformational chaff. But there’s one small problem with empowering “truth experts”: Experts are people.</td>

      <td>Among the lesser-known ofﬁces held by the father of our country was charter master of Masonic Lodge No. 22, Alexandria, Va.</td>
      <td>For generations, residents of Alexandria, Va., have taken their bearings from the imposing, stepped “lighthouse” modeled after the original in their namesake Egyptian city. It’s high on Shuter’s Hill, not far from the Potomac; everyone in the area agrees it’s the best place for sledding after a decent snowfall. But while many are aware that the structure commemorates Virginia’s most famous son, fewer know it as the George Washington Masonic National Memorial, a “temple” dedicated to enshrining Washington’s association with Freemasonry in memoriam perpetuam, and to promoting the Masons’ shared values of “liberty, justice, equality, and charity.”<br />Preparing for the Memorial’s 2023 centenary, its director of archives and exhibits, Mark A. Tabbert, realized that, despite a significant survival of Masonic Washingtoniana—even the minutes of his 1755 induction survive—“no comprehensive analysis” of his relationship with Masonry had yet been written. At the suggestion of a colleague, Mr. Tabbert set about assembling one. His intent, he says in the preface to “A Deserving Brother: George Washington and Freemasonry,” is “to present all known physical evidence of George Washington’s membership in, and lifelong support of, Freemasonry.”</td>
