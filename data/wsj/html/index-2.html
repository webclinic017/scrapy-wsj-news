What’s clear is that media leftists are concerned enough about the possibility that they are already working overtime to explain it away.<br />The City by the Bay is a place where offenses are now so unlikely to be met with strict punishment that last year one resident was comfortable participating in an on-camera interview in front of a local supermarket to explain how easily he had been able to shoplift inside.

      <td>Heavy marijuana use among youths is leading to more addiction and antisocial behavior.</td>

Asked during the 2020 presidential campaign about her pot use in college, Kamala Harris giggled and said marijuana “gives a lot of people joy” and “we need more joy in the world.” But the public needs an honest discussion of its social and public-health risks, which include violence and mental illness.<br />Alex Berenson, author of “Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence,” pointed out that the  New York Times  had curiously removed from an article about the Uvalde school shooting a former co-worker’s recollection that he complained about his grandmother not letting him smoke weed. The Times didn’t append a correction to the story as it might be expected to do when fixing a factual inaccuracy.</td>

      <td>It’s more painful on the Continent but more persistent and demand-driven in America.</td>
      <td>Leo Tolstoy’s observation that “all unhappy families are unhappy in their own way” applies to the multidecade-high inflation being experienced by countries around the world. The headline inflation numbers are increasingly similar—around 8% in both the U.S. and Europe—but the causes, consequences and treatment remain quite different. In particular, the U.S. has higher underlying inflation—which is potentially more persistent and is appropriately being treated with aggressive monetary tightening. In contrast, more of Europe’s inflation is imported—which makes it more painful than U.S. inflation but also likely more transitory, and so the European Central Bank should follow a comparatively restrained response.<br />The U.S. has had about 3 percentage points more cumulative inflation than the euro area since the onset of the pandemic. But inflation peaked in March in the U.S. and is likely to continue drifting down, while inflation rates have been rising in Europe. In the first four months of the year, inflation rose at a 12% annualized rate in Europe compared with 9% in the U.S.</td>

      <td>Testing labs in the U.S. have been earning windfall profits as a direct consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic. Using tax data from Hawaii, we found that statewide growth in private diagnostic labs’ monthly revenue tracked the volume of Covid-19 PCR tests in lockstep. Between May and December 2020, lab revenue grew at an average of 8% a month. Labs are making more than $10 a test in profit.<br />Why are these profits possible? The American healthcare system let labs set prices for Covid-19 tests well above their costs, costing taxpayers and private insurance companies dearly, for three reasons.</td>

Now President Biden is stealing from his predecessor’s industrial policy guidebook by invoking the Defense Production Act to boost domestic green energy. Don’t laugh—the White House wants to make solar panels and heat pumps to stop Vladimir Putin.<br />In rare good news, the President on Monday brought a sigh of relief to U.S. solar-power developers by announcing he wouldn’t impose tariffs for two years on imported solar panels from southeast Asia. Domestic manufacturers say their Chinese competitors are circumventing anti-dumping duties, and a Commerce Department investigation threatened to raise costs for solar projects in which U.S. firms add value.</td>

That he faced the vote at all is a sign that he and his Tory Party remain in grave political danger, and for reasons conservatives in other parts of the world can learn from.<br />The intraparty vote was triggered when at least 54 Conservative members of Parliament—15% of Mr. Johnson’s caucus—expressed dissatisfaction with Mr. Johnson’s leadership. It’s a remarkable development only two-and-a-half years after he won a historic parliamentary majority of 80 seats, including districts that had never voted Tory. Mr. Johnson prevailed Monday 211-148, but the fact that 41% of his own party no longer have confidence in him will prove terminal unless he executes a turnaround.</td>

      <td>Vetoing sports subsidies is good policy, but emulating woke cancelers is a mistake.</td>
      <td>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has picked another fight with progressive corporate America, this time the Tampa Bay Rays baseball team. When he signed the state budget last week, Mr. DeSantis zeroed out $35 million to help build a new site for the Rays’ spring training. “I don’t support giving taxpayer dollars to professional sports stadiums, period,” he said Friday.<br />This is a good policy that too few states emulate, and Florida taxpayers can be grateful that their Governor has a line-item veto and is willing to use it. He vetoed $3 billion in earmarks and pet legislative projects. But Mr. DeSantis also muddied his message by citing another reason to defund the Rays. “It’s also inappropriate to subsidize political activism of a private corporation,” he said.</td>

Sunrun ,   Sunnova Energy ,   Sunpower  and  Enphase Energy  are some of the home solar firms that should benefit, it says. (dan.molinski@wsj.com)</td>

Academic year 2020-21 placed nearly all students in a remote-learning setting. That year, I taught—and I use the term loosely—algebra-I, the prerequisite for geometry and algebra-II.

My discomfort as a person of faith with politicians offering “thoughts and prayers” in the wake of school shootings isn’t because I don’t value the potency of prayer, but rather because these statements are offered as a cheap palliative by those who should be effecting meaningful change.<br />Rabbi Bashevkin quotes Lincoln: “I have been driven many times upon my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go.” Perhaps this is the issue; our leaders pray, overwhelmed by a conviction that there is nothing else to do, when there is so much yet to be done.</td>

Last week saw calls to enact similar laws by Parliament members and militias from North Africa to the Gulf. Yemen, controlled by the Iran-backed Houthi movement, passed similar legislation Thursday. Ahead of President Biden’s trip to Israel, the Palestinian areas, Saudi Arabia and possibly other Arab states, this axis of resistance threatens to block diplomatic efforts to expand the Abraham Accords or even to reverse some of the progress.

It also shows why the president’s plan will likely fail to allow us to exit inflation with a smooth landing.<br />We don’t have a global inflation problem. Inflations are always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon spawned by the creation of excess money by local central banks. China, Japan and Switzerland also face elevated oil prices, supply-chain problems and fallout from the war in Ukraine, but their annual inflation rates are 2.1%, 2.5% and 2.5%, respectively.

Mr. Cheffins correctly explains the legal transformation but misses our point on the economic transformation. The 1720 Bubble Act effectively banned new joint stock companies but didn’t eliminate existing corporations. Without the predations of stakeholder capitalism, the latter grew in value by 48% over the ensuing century. When resources were lacking, “big projects went to large partnerships,” according to Harvard Prof. David Landes. “In the nineteenth century, when things got costlier and risks greater,” Parliament turned to “the most effective device for mobilizing capital . . . , the chartered joint stock company.”</td>

That worked out pretty well for her and her sister, Serena, in the end.<br />If only social-media platform Reddit—co-founded by Serena Williams’s now husband, Alexis Ohanian—had that kind of nerve and timing. Redditors took the market by storm last year, fueling a retail frenzy in meme stocks such as GameStop that turned investing fundamentals on their head, briefly making the WallStreetBets forum the center of the financial universe. Founded in 2005 in a dorm room, much like Facebook had been a year earlier, Reddit today is one of the most visited websites in the world with more than 50 million daily active unique users as of January.</td>

Yet, even with this welcome executive action, the U.S. can’t produce enough of some minerals, such as nickel. America must rely on undependable, often hostile foreign-controlled sources for these key materials. There is an alternative: finding politically safe, economically viable and ecologically responsible ways to get these minerals somewhere else, including the depths of the oceans.<br />Nickel is the metal currently most responsible for providing range in electric-vehicle batteries. Global nickel demand for batteries is forecast to grow 20 to 25 times by 2040, and market analysts expect significant shortages in two to three years. Russia is one of the largest suppliers of class 1 battery-grade nickel, and Chinese interests control production elsewhere in Asia, mostly underneath rainforests in the Philippines, New Caledonia and Indonesia.</td>

America, meet again the Beltway swamp.<br />Mr. Sussman was acquitted Tuesday of lying to the FBI, but not before the Durham team revealed the Clinton campaign’s work in 2016 to use both the FBI and the media to smear Donald Trump. The campaign relied on outside techies for false accusations of Trump links to Russia’s Alfa Bank, which Mr. Sussmann fed to the FBI. Fusion GPS and Christopher Steele separately funneled their infamous dossier to the Bureau. Then the Clinton team shopped the dirt to the media, using the fact of FBI investigations as proof it deserved coverage.</td>

      <td>The party, once a natural home for millions of Catholics, is now utterly hostile to anyone who opposes abortion.</td>
      <td>San Francisco’s Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone recently announced that he would block House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Catholic, from receiving communion in her hometown over her support for abortion. This was a welcome decision, and it’s far from unprecedented. Yet bishops from other dioceses often undermine such appropriate actions as these, and it’s no wonder so many Catholic Democrats enthusiastically support abortion.<br />Following action earlier this year by the House, the Senate recently voted on the Women’s Health Protection Act, a bill that would go far beyond Roe v. Wade by codifying into federal law the most extreme pro-abortion measures. Twelve out of 23 Catholics in the Senate voted for the bill, all of whom are Democrats. Seventy-six out of 134 Catholics in the House voted for it, all of whom, again, are Democrats.</td>

      <td>Reed Hastings and the streaming service study an idea that dates back at least to 1941.</td>
      <td>Reed Hastings,  Netflix ’s  co-chief executive, had a read-my-lips moment in 2015 when he vowed, “No advertising coming onto Netflix. Period.” Now that Netflix has lost 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter of this year, advertising suddenly seems like a revolutionary idea.<br />Major streamers, including  Disney ,  Peacock and HBO Max, are tiptoeing down Madison Avenue.  Amazon  recently relaunched its ad-supported platform with the name Freevee.</td>
