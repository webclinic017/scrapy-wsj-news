      <td>Investing platform’s IPO is expected to start trading Thursday in highly anticipated deal</td>
      <td>Robinhood Markets Inc. priced its initial public offering at $38 a share, at the low end of expectations, after the popular trading platform met tepid demand for its highly anticipated debut.<br />The price chosen by the company and its underwriters is at the bottom of the range of $38 to $42 a share they had been targeting. It pegs Robinhood’s valuation at about $32 billion, far higher than the nearly $12 billion it fetched in a funding round a year ago but below the lofty prior expectations of some investors and bankers.<br />Robinhood has said it and some executives would sell 55 million shares, so the offering should yield more than $2 billion.<br />The price reflects both hesitation on the part of some investors, who bristled at what they saw as the high valuation Robinhood sought, as well as a conscious decision by the company and its underwriters to be conservative in order to help set up a successful first-day of trading, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Next up for Robinhood is its trading debut, which the company will make Thursday on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the symbol HOOD. It is a markedly different debut than the traditional IPO. While most companies only allocate a small amount of stock to individual investors at the time of their IPOs, Robinhood sold a big chunk of its IPO shares to individual investors over its new platform that gives users access to IPOs before they start trading.</td>

      <td>If you bet on the central bank’s price forecasts, you lost.</td>
      <td>The Federal Reserve employs hundreds of economists whose job is assessing the American economy. So it is remarkable that the Fed is so wrong so often in its economic forecasts. The latest big miss has been its failure to anticipate this year’s surge in consumer prices.<br />Fed Chairman Jerome Powell conceded at his press conference Wednesday that prices had caught the central bank by surprise, but he showed no particular concern. The Federal Open Market Committee’s statement Wednesday after its two-day meeting also showed little interest in reeling in what has been the most reckless monetary policy since Arthur Burns roamed the Eccles Building. History hasn’t been kind to Burns.<br />Let’s compare actual inflation with the Fed’s forecasts. The nearby chart shows the estimates of inflation by Fed officials for 2021 and price increases this year. Fed governors and regional bank presidents offer their economic estimates of growth, unemployment, inflation and interest rates each quarter. The chart shows the median estimate of the Fed forecasters from June 2020 to last month for the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) deflator, the Fed’s favorite price index.<br />Note that through December 2020 Fed officials assumed PCE inflation this year of 1.8%. By March they had bumped that up to 2.4% as price pressures were already being felt. In June the median had climbed to 3.4%.<br />Yet even that catch-up drill underestimated the price surge. The PCE index had already climbed 3.6% in April from a year ago and 3.9% in May; the June figure will be out Friday.</td>

      <td>As the Jan. 6 committee meets, politics drowns out the actual story.</td>
      <td>The House inquiry on the events of Jan. 6 held its opening hearing Tuesday, and it showed why no Republican should try to brush aside the ugliness of the Capitol riot. The perpetrators who assaulted police that day weren’t overenthusiastic tourists, and the mob was not all a “loving crowd,” as Donald Trump characterized the audience for his pre-melee speech.<br />“What we were subjected to that day was like something from a medieval battle. We fought hand to hand, inch by inch, to prevent an invasion of the Capitol,” police officer Aquilino Gonell testified. “I could feel myself losing oxygen and recall thinking to myself, ‘This is how I’m going to die, defending this entrance.’” He has already had a surgery on his injured foot, he said. He needs another one on his shoulder.<br />Officer Michael Fanone, who was pulled into the crowd, said he was “grabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country.” One attacker “lunged for me and attempted to remove my firearm.” On the body camera footage, he yells a plea: “I’ve got kids!” He was eventually diagnosed with a heart attack, a concussion and a traumatic brain injury.<br />Republicans are focused on why the Capitol was so badly protected on Jan. 6, which is a good question, and if Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s committee wants to be taken seriously, it should examine that in detail. But here’s what the No. 3 House Republican, Elise Stefanik, told the press before Tuesday’s hearing: “The American people deserve to know the truth: that Nancy Pelosi bears responsibility, as Speaker of the House, for the tragedy that occurred on Jan. 6.”<br />What kind of voter is this supposed to convince? Security oversights in the run-up to the riot are fair game, but it’s hardly credible to point to them alone, without acknowledging that President Trump urged his supporters to stop the supposed steal. On Jan. 6 some of them took his words seriously, literally, or both, and Mr. Trump dallied instead of rushing to Congress’s defense. The GOP would be better off ceding weak ground by admitting that the election wasn’t stolen and Mr. Trump was wrong.</td>

      <td>A new McKinsey study documents the severe student learning loss.</td>
      <td>Shutting down schools was among the most destructive policies of the pandemic, and a new report by McKinsey & Co. quantifies the harm.<br />The consulting firm examined spring 2021 test results for 1.6 million students in grades 1 through 6 across the U.S., then compared their performance with that of similar students pre-pandemic. They discovered that the pandemic-era children were, on average, about four months behind in reading and five months behind in math.<br />However bleak, these numbers “likely represent an optimistic scenario,” McKinsey says. The results measure “outcomes for students who took interim assessments in the spring in a school building—and thus exclude students who remained remote throughout the entire school year, and who may have experienced the most disruption to their schooling.”<br />The McKinsey study doesn’t say it, but teachers unions were the main architects of this calamity by first refusing to return to the classroom, then insisting on watered-down schedules. The data company Burbio found that, by the end of the spring semester, most students could attend school at least part-time. But due to union demands, the return sometimes amounted to a few days or hours of in-person learning a week.<br />McKinsey found that children in majority black schools ended the school year a full six months behind in math and reading on average. Students in schools where the average household income was below $25,000 were seven months behind in math and six months in reading.</td>

      <td>The mayor promises to focus on quality-of-life issues. Seriously.</td>
      <td>Bill de Blasio has rediscovered “broken windows,” the idea that tolerating little disorders such as broken windows in abandoned buildings will eventually lead to larger disorder. This was the gist of the New York mayor’s answer Tuesday to a question about the illegal drinking, pot smoking and other behavior that has contributed to the mayhem in Washington Square Park.<br />“There’s more to do in making sure that we set the right parameters, but right now our focus has been bringing this city back, addressing the most serious concerns, and then more and more, we’re starting to be able to focus on the quality-of-life concerns as well,” the mayor told reporters.<br />Mr. de Blasio’s promise to “focus” on quality-of-life is welcome. But it comes with barely five months left in his eight-year tenure, and after years of a very different message. Long before George Floyd and the defund-the-police movement, Mr. de Blasio won office with an anti-cop campaign—and last summer he cut police funding by $1 billion. When the City Council passed a bill that encouraged police to end arrests for quality-of-life offenses such as public drinking or public urination, he signed it. On his watch, city district attorneys decided not to prosecute certain misdemeanor offenses.<br />The results have been predictable. In September more than 160 CEOs of some of the city’s most prominent businesses warned that concerns about security and livability threaten New York’s post-Covid 19 recovery. “There is widespread anxiety over public safety, cleanliness and other quality of life issues that are contributing to deteriorating conditions in commercial districts and neighborhoods across the five boroughs,” they wrote.<br />Broken windows policing transformed New York from a crime-ridden metropolis to what it was when Mr. de Blasio was elected: the safest big city in America. It’s too late for Mr. de Blasio to do anything about the decline in public safety and order, but it’s not too late for the next mayor to learn from his mistakes.</td>

      <td>Some surprising findings as the InSight lander uses seismology to map out the inside of the Red Planet.</td>
      <td>The NASA team operating the InSight lander on Mars last week published its analysis of the more than 700 minor “marsquakes” recorded by the vehicle since it began surface operations on the Red Planet in February 2019. The world now has its first view of the inner workings of another planet, with potential implications for a better understanding of how the solar system developed and the evolution of life on Earth.<br />One might have imagined Mars to be a smaller version of Earth, but the seismic noises detected by InSight suggest not only different geological composition but different formation and heat-flow dynamics as well. Petroleum engineers use seismic waves that travel and refract though deep layers of the Earth’s crust to search for pockets of oil and gas. The InSight team designed the lander to record seismic waves reverberating on the surface of Mars and use them to explore the inner structure of the planet.<br />The science of seismology is relatively young. It wasn’t until the early 20th century that seismologists discovered the nature of the Earth’s crust, core and mantle. Geologists and planetary scientists have since come to rely on seismology as an essential tool.<br />Mars is seismically more active than expected, although the marsquakes recorded by InSight are smaller and substantially less powerful than earthquakes. Without oceans, there’s less background seismic noise on Mars, so the lander can detect signals from small tremors located thousands of miles away.<br />Despite these advantages, challenges remain for the three groups that reported their analyses this week in the magazine Science. Most of the marsquakes originate in the crust, and only a fraction of seismic waves probe deeper regions. Petrologists, geochemists, mineral physicist and geodynamicists looked at data from 10 of these deep quakes as well as data from Martian meteorites and other direct surface observations of Mars.</td>

      <td>There’s plenty of action on Capitol Hill, and not all of it has to do with the Jan. 6 Commission. Washington’s power and the future of American free enterprise hinge on how the drama surrounding the infrastructure legislation plays out.<br />A group of Republican senators led by Ohio’s Rob Portman are negotiating with Democrats on a bipartisan bill that, depending on what’s agreed to, might be imperfect legislation that’s decidedly useful to support. At the same time, Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders along with their House counterparts are preparing the $3.5 trillion American Jobs Plan for passage on a straight party-line vote.<br />But will most Americans accept the gigantic expansion of government contemplated by the AJP? The legislation implements confiscatory taxes to fund a cradle-to-grave welfare state, likely producing sclerotic growth in jobs and wages and pressure to raise taxes still higher to fund the left’s vision.<br />Republicans have to make these consequences clear to voters, but it won’t be all that easy. The climate for Democratic attempts to expand government is better than it has been in decades. The country has moved left. A March 2019 Pew Research poll found the country equally divided—47% favored “smaller government, fewer services” while 47% favored “bigger government, more services.” Less than 20 years ago, “smaller government” had over half the country’s support, while “bigger government” had closer to a third.<br />Still, some very important voters have concerns today about the AJP and the trillions it would add to the federal budget and debt. A Harris X poll commissioned by No Labels, a centrist political group, surveyed 12,000 voters from July 16-21 in 20 swing districts and 13 districts of members of the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group composed of equal numbers of Democratic and Republican House middle-of-the-roaders.</td>

      <td>Give them the time and resources to finish their degrees after their athletic eligibility runs out.</td>
      <td>On June 21, the Supreme Court ruled that the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s strict limits on compensation for student-athletes violated antitrust law. The door is now open for college athletes to license their names, images and likenesses.<br />The lion’s share of licensing money will likely accrue to a small number of elite college athletes who are headed toward careers in professional sports. Most NCAA athletes won’t go pro, but they will have long working careers after they leave college—with or without a degree.<br />When it comes to ethical treatment of—and lifelong success for—these student-athletes, much work remains for the universities that benefit from college sports. Unlike with licensing, universities can make swift and meaningful changes to athletic scholarships. Rather than continue the status quo, I propose moving to a 10-year athletic scholarship that allows players to pursue rigorous degrees as student-athletes.<br />The current “redshirt” system, allowing for four years of athletic eligibility spread over five academic years, gives the illusion that college athletes are getting a free, high-quality education. “Look, football and school don’t go together,” said Josh Rosen, then a quarterback at the University of California, Los Angeles, in a 2017 interview with BleacherReport.com. “Trying to do both is like trying to do two full-time jobs.”<br />According to a 2016 NCAA study, the average Division 1 athlete devoted 33 hours a week to sports-related activities during the season. Anyone who argues that college athletes get a free education hasn’t spent time living their daily schedules. College athletes endure hours of grueling practice, conditioning, injury rehabilitation and film study. Plus, there is coursework—done only at a cursory level due to time constraints.</td>

      <td>Last week’s bad news reflects a failure to understand statistics.</td>
      <td>Life is short, but not as short as you may think. Headlines last week trumpeted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s finding that the average U.S. life expectancy for a newborn declined by 1.5 years in 2020, and more for blacks and Hispanics. It’s fake news, the result of a misinterpreted statistic. In reality, a person born today can almost certainly expect to live as long as or longer than he could have expected a year ago.<br />The figure the CDC reported last week is known as “period life expectancy.” It measures the average length of time a hypothetical American who, from birth to death, is exposed to the mortality rates observed in the current period. That means the 2020 statistic assumes that Covid will be killing people forever at the same rate as it did last year—an implausible scenario.<br />The common-sense definition of life expectancy is captured in what demographers call “cohort life expectancy”—the life expectancy of an individual born in a given year using actual mortality rates in each period of his life so far and predicted mortality rates for future periods. Cohort life expectancy for new cohorts has increased slowly over time and is expected to continue increasing as medical knowledge advances.<br />The decline in period life expectancy owing to the Covid pandemic is likely to prove (you’ll pardon the expression) short-lived. The pandemic’s indirect effect on the more meaningful cohort life expectancy is likely to be positive since the recent gains in medical knowledge and vaccine technology can be expected to extend life expectancy for incoming cohorts as it leads to better treatments for all types of diseases.<br />Demographers use period life expectancy as a rough indication of movements in cohort life expectancy in long-run data series. That’s reasonable when there is no significant short-run fluctuation in period mortality rates. The greater the fluctuation in short-run mortality, the less reliable period life expectancy becomes as a proxy for cohort life expectancy. It amplifies the noise in the data.</td>

      <td>Jailers were told to keep him from communicating with anyone—for years. What awful crime had he committed to merit such treatment?</td>
      <td>History possesses more than a few mysteries. Josephine Wilkinson took up one of them in “The Princes in the Tower” (2013), a biographical quest in which she tried to determine whether Richard III had indeed had his two young nephews murdered to secure his seizure of the English crown. Now she takes up another: What was the identity of the Man in the Iron Mask, the strangely disguised figure who was kept in prison for decades by order of Louis XIV?<br />As Ms. Wilkinson notes, no court of law had consigned him first to Pignerol, the French prison in northern Italy, and later to the Bastille in Paris. He was never put on trial, so there is no record of his alleged crime. He was deprived of liberty by that infamous device, the “Lettre de Cachet,” by which the French king could order someone to be locked away without having to give a reason. Sometimes the letter was issued at the request of a man’s aggrieved family or some offended nobleman. Voltaire, who would take an interest in the mystery of the famous prisoner, was himself briefly held in the Bastille at royal command.<br />There were, Ms. Wilkerson says, two notable prisoners in Pignerol at the time of the mystery man’s incarceration: Nicolas Fouquet, a former finance minister who had hoped to succeed Cardinal Mazarin in 1661 as France’s powerful first minister but who was instead charged with treasonable offenses; and the Comte de Lauzun, who was beloved of one of Louis’s cousins (a woman known as La Grande Mademoiselle) but who had offended the king’s mistress. In “The Man in the Iron Mask,” Ms. Wilkinson devotes long chapters to both of them. Their stories are certainly interesting but add little to the quest for the masked man’s identity, except this: He seems to have served briefly as Fouquet’s valet, which suggests that he wasn’t of noble birth.<br />Upon his arrest at Calais in 1669, he was registered as Eustache Dauger (or d’Auger), though he was given other names at other times, his true identity therefore never being surely established. He had somehow incurred the king’s “displeasure.” The governor of Pignerol, an official named Saint-Mars, was told to prevent the prisoner, when he arrived, from communicating with anyone “by any means whatsoever.” Ms. Wilkinson reports that, during the three weeks’ journey from Calais, the prisoner wasn’t masked: It seems unlikely that the journey was made without a word being exchanged.<br />He would remain a prisoner, always in the charge of Saint-Mars, until he died in the Bastille in 1703 or 1704, when he must have been at least in his 60s. He seems to have been resigned to his lot and to the silence in which he was condemned to live. He was reputedly devout, attending Mass regularly. There is no contemporary evidence of an iron mask—that detail seems to have been an invention of rumor and speculation, then myth—but he is said to have concealed his face behind a mask of black velvet. Those who did see his face, or said they did, reported him to be handsome. No explanation for his confinement was ever given, but the king and his ministers—especially Louis’s war minister, the Marquis de Louvois—continued to receive reports of his condition and conduct.</td>

From Capitol Hill to Main Street, Republicans and Democrats don’t even bother discussing anything of political substance. What’s the point if 90% of the opposition is against whatever you’ve got? That leaves “independents” as the only thing that moves, and the bad news for Mr. Biden and his party’s immovable 90 percenters is the indies are in motion.<br />In mid-June, Mr. Biden’s approval rating in the Gallup poll was a decent 56%. It’s now 50%. Among independents, he’s at 48%, down 7 points. If you were in a plane that lost altitude that fast, you’d be white-knuckling both armrests.<br />Presidential approval as a leading indicator of party fortunes carries weight among political analysts. My other preferred metric is “direction of the country,” a one-stop consideration of everything in play. When that sentiment heads south, the party holding the bag of power is in trouble.<br />The ABC News-Ipsos poll released this week shows 55% of respondents pessimistic about the country’s direction, a 20-point drop since May. Among independents, the downdraft hit 26 points. As Joe Biden might say, “Gee, what happened?”<br />If all you are tracking is Mr. Biden himself, the answer is, not much. The president routinely shows up, does a competent job of reading something in the teleprompter, and turns over the fill-in-the-blanks job to Jen Psaki.</td>

      <td>People alleging that  Johnson & Johnson ’s  talc-based baby powder caused their cancers asked a federal court to forbid the company from taking steps to place its talc liabilities in bankruptcy, while lawmakers sought information about the same issue from J&J’s CEO.<br />A committee representing talc-injury claimants asked for a restraining order forbidding J&J from carving out talc-related liabilities from the rest of the business. J&J has told personal-injury lawyers it is considering bankruptcy for a subsidiary as a way to resolve lawsuits and future claims stemming from talc, The Wall Street Journal reported last week.<br />Separating out talc liabilities from other assets is a first step toward the bankruptcy plan, the injury claimants said in court papers filed Wednesday.<br />“We stand behind the safety of our products as decades of independent scientific testing has confirmed that our talc is safe and does not cause cancer,” a J&J spokeswoman said Wednesday. The company has previously said it hasn’t decided on any course of action regarding talc lawsuits, except to defend the safety of its products and to fight pending claims.<br />As of April, there were roughly 28,900 pending U.S. lawsuits linking the company’s talc-containing powders, which it stopped selling last year, to ovarian cancer and the asbestos cancer mesothelioma.</td>

      <td>The Fed is putting a $500 billion cap on the facility and is offering a similar tool to foreign central banks</td>
      <td>The Federal Reserve is launching new facilities designed to provide liquidity to big Wall Street banks and foreign institutions like central banks, which could help ensure market stability at times of stress.<br />The central bank on Wednesday said it would put a so-called standing repo facility in place, effective Thursday. The Fed said the new tool would take in Treasury, agency-debt and agency-mortgage-backed securities from primary dealer firms in exchange for one-day loans of cash, at a rate of 0.25%. It said there is a daily cap of $500 billion on the facility, and it offered a similar tool to foreign official institutions.<br />The Fed said it would expand access to the standing repo facility in the future to deposit-taking banks. The facility targeted at primary dealers will see daily operations, and the one for foreign central banks will operate as needed.<br />The new facility is a backstop for financial markets priced at a level that would discourage active usage, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in a press conference that followed the central bank’s rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The standing repo facility is “there to help address pressures in monetary markets that could impede the effective implementation of monetary policy,” he said.<br />Instituting such a permanent facility reduces the prospects the Fed will have to add liquidity to markets on an ad hoc basis via repurchase agreements, or repos. These repos are de facto short-term loans of cash to eligible financial firms, collateralized with Treasury or mortgage bonds. In the past couple of years, the Fed has had to engage in these repo operations to bolster banking sector reserves and to help navigate the first wave of market panic caused by the coronavirus pandemic.</td>

She could face legal hurdles in targeting online platforms, however, as a law known as Section 230 generally shields internet companies from liability for the actions of their users.<br />Democratic commissioners suggested they would focus initially on learning more about the algorithms that big tech platforms might be using to disseminate scams.<br />“If we are not able to dig in and understand how that targeting works, how those algorithms work, we will not be able to hold them accountable when they are amplifying fraud,” said Commissioner Rohit Chopra. “We can’t just go after fraudsters one by one, we need to look at the gatekeepers and those who profit from amplifying them as well.”</td>

      <td>Décor columnist Michelle Slatalla won’t be talked out of her distaste for dining outside, a wildly popular activity she finds overrated</td>
      <td>WHEN I LIVED on Long Island, every May 15 I resolved to entertain outdoors throughout the entire summer. The weather was just perfect! We put a jaunty green canvas canopy over our back patio, got out the wicker furniture and made a long list of outdoor weekend dinner parties we’d host up until and including Labor Day.<br />What the hell was I thinking? By June, I never wanted to step foot outdoors again. It was hot, it was humid, and even though malaria seemed pretty much under control in the neighborhood, the mosquitoes were so thick and violent I had to stop my husband from burning truck tires to keep them at bay.<br />I’d like to say that entertaining outdoors got easier when I moved to northern California. It didn’t. Temperatures plunge into the low 50s at night. It’s windy, so the candles always blow out. After dark, I can hear the fruit rats chittering in the palm tree by the garage. And with our current drought and newest biblical weather event—Firestorm Season—half the time it’s a red flag day when you’re not allowed to barbecue anyway.<br />No matter where you live, outdoor entertaining is overrated. Which is why I’ve pretty much given up on it. But weirdly, it turns out that I’m in the minority.<br />“Every year we see more and more growth in people’s commitment to their outdoor spaces,” said Jackie Hirschhaut, the executive director of the International Casual Furnishings Association in High Point, N.C., which surveys people nationwide annually about how they plan to use their outdoor spaces. “And this year, the whole Covid experience put that trend on steroids. I think people rediscovered their outdoor space—like a room that all of a sudden you clean out and realize you can use.”</td>

      <td>Since the disgraceful events of January 6, there’s been a partisan debate over whether the Capitol riot was an attempted coup or a political protest gone horribly wrong. So far, sentences handed out to participants suggest the latter.<br />This may come as something of a surprise to casual consumers of political commentary. Opining in the Washington Post, Dana Milbank expresses the views of many congressional Democrats and cable TV pundits when he writes of “insurrectionists” and “armed attackers” and “the terrorists who took up arms against the U.S. government on that terrible day.”<br />The prosecutions concluded to date are for less serious offenses, which may be reassuring to those tempted to believe the government was at risk of being overthrown. Hannah Rabinowitz and Marshall Cohen of CNN report:<br />Presiding Judge Reggie Walton reflected on the events of that January day and said, “it’s an embarrassment to me, it should be an embarrassment to every American.” Indeed it should be. It also should be important to every American to see that those who broke the law are appropriately punished—no more or less.<br />“So far, at least 23 defendants have pleaded guilty. At least 12 defendants,” CBS News reports, “have agreed to cooperate with the government. At least 17 have pleaded guilty to misdemeanors only, while six have pleaded guilty to felonies.” The CBS report continues:</td>

Many U.S. children will be back in school by mid-August, and the window for planning a European vacation may already be too narrow to attract a flood of Americans.<br />Still, Alex Beard, chief executive of London’s Royal Opera House, said the city’s famous theater district could gain. “Visitors from the United States are a hugely important part of the audience,” he said.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Justice Department warned states on Wednesday that they must comply with federal election laws, underscoring the Biden administration’s focus on voting access as some Republican-led states have passed new laws narrowing voting options that were expanded during the pandemic.<br />“The right of all eligible citizens to vote is the central pillar of our democracy, and the Justice Department will use all of the authorities at its disposal to zealously guard that right,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.<br />The guidance documents lay out the rights voters have under federal law and requirements governing postelection audits. While they don’t present any new rules, they signal the administration’s priority to enforce current federal laws, including the Voting Rights Act and laws protecting voting access for voters with disabilities or military and overseas voters.<br />“You should not assume that if you abandon the practices that have made it easier for people to vote, that abandonment is not going to get scrutiny from the Department of Justice,” a DOJ official told reporters, describing the message the department’s new guidance documents are meant to send.<br />The Biden administration is facing pressure to do more on voting rights from activists who say that a raft of new voting laws in Republican-controlled states, such as Georgia and Florida, will make it harder to vote, especially for minority groups. Last month, the department sued Georgia over its new voting law, alleging it aims to restrict the rights of Black voters in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.</td>

When he failed to respond, we turned to the next best source: Rob Crabtree, co-owner (though he prefers the title co-captain) of Boat Drinks, a St. Augustine, Fla., bar that opened in December 2019. (After closing during the pandemic, the bar reopened in September 2020.)<br />“Boat drinks are a state of mind,” Mr. Crabtree said. “Whatever you’re enjoying around the water, the pool, a boat, that’s a boat drink.”<br />Boat drinks are generally easy to make and easy to drink. Relatively low in alcohol, they’re “sessionable” in bartender parlance, Mr. Crabtree noted. More often than not, they’re made with rum or lightened with a bubbly mixer. Bonus points if the drink can be transported in a cooler.<br />“It’s something you can enjoy out in the sun,” Mr. Crabtree emphasized. “It’s not just downing Martinis or Old Fashioneds; they don’t go well with the sun and water.”</td>

The person said the administration is also strongly considering more stringent masking protocols for unvaccinated federal workers. Such policies could affect millions of workers, depending on which categories of employees were included.<br />Mr. Biden said Tuesday that a policy requiring vaccines for federal workers was under consideration. He also said in a statement that he plans to lay out the next steps for getting more Americans vaccinated in a speech on Thursday. CNN first reported the president’s expected announcement for federal workers.<br />The administration is ramping up its efforts to fend off the highly contagious Delta variant. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised its mask guidance to recommend vaccinated people in some parts of the country resume wearing them indoors. It also said K-12 schools should adopt universal masking, regardless of vaccination status. Local officials in some areas have begun reimposing mask rules or requiring public workers to get the Covid-19 vaccine, and some companies have issued vaccine mandates.</td>

      <td>A global dash for cash sparked by the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020 forced the Federal Reserve to buy hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. Treasury securities in a matter of days to prevent a broader meltdown in financial markets.<br />A new report from a group that includes former central bankers warns that failing to address key market fragilities revealed by that episode could weaken the confidence in the market for U.S. Treasurys, which is widely assumed to be the global risk-free asset.<br />On Wednesday, the Group of 30, an independent group of prominent central bankers, financiers, regulators and academics whose members include Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who previously chaired the Fed, released its overview of the problems that plagued the Treasury market in March 2020, along with 10 recommendations to reduce the risk that the Fed would have to make similar interventions in future crises. Former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner chaired the working group that produced Wednesday’s report.<br />Sales of Treasurys by an array of investors seeking to raise cash in March 2020 were so extreme that the Fed would likely have had to intervene in the market no matter what, the report said.<br />“No financial system could have withstood the shock of the pandemic without exceptional actions by the Fed,” Mr. Geithner said in an interview. “But making the Treasury market more resilient would reduce the damage to the financial system caused by future shocks, whatever the source, and reduce the need for exceptional action by the Fed in crisis.”</td>

      <td>It isn’t so different from the ‘living constitution’ movement of a half-century ago.</td>
      <td>Regarding David Rivkin and Andrew Grossman’s “The Temptation of the ‘Common Good’” (op-ed, July 24): There is always a temptation to seek a shortcut around the hard work of politics and persuading our fellow citizens to embrace the principles and practices that we think are right. Theories of judicially enforced “living constitutionalism” have long sought precisely such a shortcut. Jurists like William Brennan argued that judges should impose the rule that they think best and hope that the people would eventually come around to accepting the rule, and the imposition, as just.<br />Unfortunately, on this dimension the common-good constitutionalists are not so different than the living constitutionalists of a half-century ago. They take their bearings from a different moral compass, and they promise results that will win plaudits from the right rather than the left. But they share the same basic impatience as the judicial activists of yore. Why wait until one can build popular majorities and win elections on your policy platform when unelected judges could give you the results now? Why should judges rely on broadly accepted principles of limited government when they could instead enforce polarizing but substantively rich principles of the public good? Why should judges limit themselves to democratically endorsed legal standards and sources when they could draw on the deep well of moral philosophy for insights into better governance?<br />Conservatives once saw the dangers of imposing moral values from the bench and appreciated the modest virtues of fighting for sometimes partial and transitory victories in the arena of democratic politics. The hope that legal elites will embrace the common-good constitutionalists’ favored moral truth seems like a fantasy—and not one we ought to want to pursue in a pluralistic democracy.<br />Prof. Keith E.

      <td>It isn’t a woke attack to ensure that charitable tax rules get resources to charities and the beneficiaries they serve.</td>
      <td>Naomi Schaefer Riley’s “The Weekend Interview with Elise Westhoff: The Woke Threat to Philanthropy” (July 17) illustrates a misunderstanding of the tax rules governing philanthropy and of the proposals of the Initiative to Accelerate Charitable Giving, embodied in the ACE Act. Rather than being part of a “woke takeover of philanthropy,” this bipartisan bill, introduced by a Republican (Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley) and an independent (Maine Sen. Angus King), adopts important guardrails to ensure that charitable tax rules fulfill their intended purpose—getting resources to charities and the beneficiaries they serve.<br />In opposing this bill, Ms. Westhoff takes the surprising position that Congress has little role in establishing the parameters of charitable tax benefits. Yet the tax code is full of requirements to ensure that funds that receive the many generous tax benefits of charitable giving—worth as much as 74% of the donation—serve a public and not a private benefit.<br />One position taken by the Philanthropy Roundtable under Ms. Westhoff’s leadership is that private foundations should be allowed to fully meet their 5% payout obligation by paying salaries for family members or by making contributions to donor-advised funds, which themselves have no further payout rule. These positions are antithetical to core conservative principles that have long decried wasteful government spending and recognized the need for a strong charitable sector.<br />Prof. Ray D.

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Federal Reserve indicated that the economy has made progress toward the central bank’s employment and inflation goals, and officials offered a hint they could begin to reduce their asset purchases later this year.<br />The Fed since the end of last year has said its monthly purchases of $120 billion in bonds would continue until the economy achieves “substantial further progress” toward the Fed’s goals of low unemployment and inflation reaching 2%. On Wednesday, the Fed said that “since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings.”<br />Officials had been set to deepen their deliberations over how and when to begin paring, or tapering, their asset purchases, which they initiated in March 2020 to quell an incipient market panic. With their short-term benchmark interest rate pinned near zero, they have continued to purchase Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities at the current pace since June 2020 to provide additional stimulus by holding down longer-term interest rates.<br />The Fed’s statement also modestly upgraded its assessment of the economy. “With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen,” it said. “The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have shown improvement but have not fully recovered,” it said. Officials in June had described those sectors as remaining weak.<br />Supply-chain bottlenecks have driven inflation to higher levels than many economists expected this year, and those readings have raised “the possibility that inflation could turn out to be higher and more persistent than we expect,” said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at a news conference after Wednesday’s meeting.</td>

And like other companies going public, the trading-app company laid out in its prospectus certain risk factors associated with its business that it thinks investors should be aware of before buying in.<br />Some of those factors are tied to something IPO investors look for—explosive growth. Growth can bode well for potential future profits but, as the company points out in its regulatory filing, it remains to be seen how successfully it can sustain and manage that growth.<br />Robinhood was caught unprepared last year by a spike in trading volume when stocks were crashing early in the pandemic, which led to repeated outages during a volatile time for markets.<br />Earlier this year, Robinhood again was blindsided by a spike in popularity during the thick of the trading frenzy surrounding  GameStop Corp.  and other so-called meme stocks. When the capital required as a risk cushion rose by billions of dollars, Robinhood was forced to get emergency financing. It also temporarily halted trading in some of the most in-demand stocks, which damaged its reputation.<br />Part of Robinhood’s popularity was that it was at the forefront of a push to make investing more affordable with zero-commission trades. Its business model instead relies more heavily on revenue from payment for order flow, a practice in which high-speed trading firms pay brokerages for the right to execute orders. That practice has been around for decades but has faced new scrutiny by regulators in the wake of the GameStop frenzy. Robinhood attributed 81% of its first-quarter revenue to such transactions.</td>

It administered the second dose of vaccines—a mix of Western and Chinese shots—in just seven days. UNICEF, the United Nations’ agency for children, described the second leg of the campaign as “arguably the fastest vaccination campaign to be executed during a pandemic.”<br />While wealthy countries such as the U.S., Canada and those in Europe have inoculated 50% or more of their populations, poor countries continue to lag behind, leaving them dangerously exposed to the more transmissible Delta variant that is now spreading quickly world-wide.<br />Bhutan has now fully vaccinated 61.8% of its total population. Among its neighbors in South Asia, India has fully vaccinated 7% of its population against the virus, Nepal 5% and Bangladesh 2.6%, according to Our World in Data, a project based at the University of Oxford.<br />Bhutan began its vaccination campaign earlier this year with 550,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine donated by India.

      <td>Chairman asks staff to consider whether climate-related statements should be required in 10-K annual reports</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—Public companies could be required to disclose climate-change related risks to investors in regulatory filings under a proposal being formulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, a step that could expose them to new litigation threats.<br />SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said Wednesday he has asked agency staff to consider whether climate-related disclosures should be filed in companies’ annual reports, known as Form 10-K, along with financial data and other information considered crucial to investors. That would require them to provide statements that are both complete and accurate, making it easier for SEC enforcement attorneys to investigate firms or their directors for fraud or disclosure failures.<br />While some companies currently provide some information on climate risks, Mr. Gensler said in a speech that those disclosures can be inconsistent and difficult to compare. He likened standardized disclosures to Olympic races.<br />“It’s not like some sprinters run a 100-meter dash and others run 90 meters,” he said in a speech to Principles for Responsible Investment. “Investors today are asking for that ability to compare companies with each other. Generally, I believe it’s with mandatory disclosures that investors can benefit from that consistency and comparability.”<br />The SEC has broad authority to require disclosures by companies selling securities, and the Biden administration has made addressing climate change a central priority across the federal government.  But because climate change doesn’t affect every company’s bottom line in the same way, the planned SEC rules have become politically controversial and have set off a wave of lobbying in Washington.</td>

      <td>THE PANDEMIC BROUGHT many families closer together, but even the tightest clans can squabble over Scrabble matches after one too many game nights. A surfeit of together-time is triggering a rise in demand for kid-free vacations, said Jack Ezon, founder of travel company Embark Beyond. Sixty-one percent of the summer trips that Embark Beyond booked this year were for adults only, compared with 48% in 2019. These grown-up escapes aren’t just for couples. Some are booked by groups of friends who want to travel together after many months of Zoom-only contact or individuals seeking solo sojourns. To help you plan your own immersion in maturity we’ve selected five resorts that offer decidedly grown-up diversions, from wining and dining to flopping down on a beach with a thick page-turner and uninterrupted nap time.<br />One of the Amalfi coast’s most iconic hideaways, Il San Pietro (which welcomes ages 10 and up) is perched dramatically on a cliff edge. The rooms, carved into rocky hillsides, almost blend into the landscape, while the décor marries old-world elegance with Mediterranean chic. All 56 rooms open onto balconies with sea views. An elevator whisks guests down the cliff to the only private beach associated with a hotel in Positano. With an Aperol spritz in hand, stare at the sunset from the grand terrace. Its Michelin star Zass restaurant prepares local Mediterranean dishes like scampi tartare, with ingredients from its on-site organic gardens. From about $850 a night, ilsanpietro.com<br />The Post Ranch Inn stands 1,200 feet above the Pacific on the cliffs of Big Sur. Like the home at Green O, the inn’s 39 guest rooms bring to mind lavish treehouses, most built for two (no guests under age 18 allowed). The spa offers massages and private yoga and meditation classes. You can also book an astrology or shaman session. Or commune with the celestial spirits yourself by taking in the night sky—far from city lights, the hotel is a sublime place to stargaze. From $1,425 a night, postranchinn.com<br />Canaves Oia Suites sit on top of a cliff on the Greek island of Santorini. A kid-free enclave (only ages 13 and up allowed) of Canaves Oia Resorts, the suites are housed in a whitewashed building facing the Santorini Caldera and the Aegean Sea. Verandas come with private pools and if you feel like mingling with the wider world, book a sailing tour or wander around the mazelike village of Oia admiring the Cycladic architecture. From about $830 a night, canaves.com/canaves-oia-suites<br />Dude ranches typically attract fidgety families but Montana’s Green O, a secluded part of the sprawling Paws Up Ranch, is a more grown-up approach to the great outdoors. Guests (ages 21 and up) stay in 12 sleekly modern, glass-walled homes. One of them, the Tree Haus, elevated at least 23 feet above ground, makes a sophisticated perch to spy on wildlife. Guests can indulge in spa treatments or more active pursuits, including fly-fishing and biking. From about $2,790 a night, thegreeno.com</td>

      <td>The Small Business Administration said it would make it easier for the smallest businesses that got funds from the Paycheck Protection Program to have their loans forgiven, as the agency seeks to wind down the Covid-19 rescue program.<br />About 2 million business owners with PPP loans of $150,000 or less will soon be allowed to apply for loan forgiveness directly through the SBA instead of their banks. There are about 7.1 million PPP loans that remain outstanding and about 6 million are for $150,000 or less.<br />Eligible borrowers will receive an email from the SBA with a link to the online portal, said Patrick Kelley, associate administrator for SBA’s office of capital access. The application should take less than 10 minutes to complete, he said, and the SBA has created a customer service line to answer borrower questions.<br />Banks responsible for originating the PPP loans must opt into direct forgiveness before their borrowers can use the SBA’s online platform, a decision that could potentially limit the initiative’s reach. Currently, over 500 banks, representing 30% of qualifying loans, have agreed to let their customers apply for forgiveness using the SBA portal, which begins accepting applications on Aug. 4.<br />The largest bank to opt into the program so far is  Customers Bank ,  which made more than 320,000 PPP loans worth a total of $9.6 billion. The bank, whose average PPP loan was under $30,000, said that the SBA portal “is the fastest and best way to assure quick approval of loan forgiveness of small PPP loans.”</td>

The Taliban see China as a source of international legitimacy, a potential economic supporter and a means of influence over Pakistan, a Chinese ally that has aided the group.<br />Peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban have dragged on with little progress, increasing the likelihood of more bloodshed once the U.S. fully withdraws. The Taliban’s gains recently drove the U.S. military to launch airstrikes in the country, despite plans to depart by the end of August.</td>

      <td>Surge in operating profit comes as R&D, capex and sales expenditures track below normal</td>
      <td>Google’s great quarter may have been a little too great.<br />Alphabet Inc.,  parent company of the internet advertising titan, posted revenue of $61.9 billion for the second quarter, up 62% year over year. That is the best growth rate the company has seen since early 2007, when its business was about one-seventeenth its current size. Easy comparisons helped; last year’s second quarter was the first and so far only time that Google or its parent has ever posted a revenue decline. But all facets of the company’s business—from the cloud to YouTube—are also performing extremely well. YouTube’s advertising revenue exploded 84% year over year to $7 billion.<br />The strong top line wasn’t the only good news. Google’s operating profit of about $19.4 billion more than doubled from last year’s second quarter. It produced an operating margin of 31.3%, the company’s highest since early 2012. That was of particular interest to investors, considering the company averaged a margin closer to 21% for the three years leading up to the pandemic. Alphabet’s share price rose more than 3% Wednesday, the best reaction among the big tech trio that includes  Apple Inc.  and  Microsoft  that reported quarterly results late Tuesday.<br />But that bottom line may get some slimming soon. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat warned on Alphabet’s earnings call that the company typically picks up its hiring pace in the third quarter. She also mentioned the accounting benefit produced by the company’s decision earlier this year to extend the useful life of its servers and other equipment, which reduced its depreciation expense and gave a $561 million boost to net income in the second quarter but will have a lower impact going forward.<br />Mostly, though, Google’s recent burst of business might not have allowed its regular spending to catch up. Research and development expenditures have averaged 15% of revenue over the past five years but amounted to only 12% in the second quarter. Sales and marketing expenses likewise were well below normal, reaching just 8% of second-quarter revenue compared with an 11% average. The latter is particularly important to Google as it looks to ramp up its cloud business against fierce competition from  Amazon  and Microsoft, where it still runs a distant third. Microsoft outspent Google in this area by 11% in the June quarter; its Azure public cloud business also grew 51% during the period to about $9.4 billion in revenue—twice the size of Google Cloud.</td>

Similarly, Tesla posted a record profit for the most recent quarter in which it saw car deliveries more than double from a year earlier as other auto makers struggled with production.</td>

      <td>Ivermectin is a promising Covid treatment and prophylaxis, but the agency is denigrating it.</td>
      <td>The Food and Drug Administration claims to follow the science. So why is it attacking ivermectin, a medication it certified in 1996?<br />Earlier this year the agency put out a special warning that “you should not use ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19.” The FDA’s statement included words and phrases such as “serious harm,” “hospitalized,” “dangerous,” “very dangerous,” “seizures,” “coma and even death” and “highly toxic.” Any reader would think the FDA was warning against poison pills. In fact, the drug is FDA-approved as a safe and effective antiparasitic.<br />Ivermectin was developed and marketed by  Merck  & Co. while one of us (Mr. Hooper) worked there years ago. William C. Campbell and Satoshi Omura won the 2015 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for discovering and developing avermectin, which Mr. Campbell and associates modified to create ivermectin.<br />Ivermectin is on the World Health Organization’s List of Essential Medicines. Merck has donated four billion doses to prevent river blindness and other diseases in Africa and other places where parasites are common. A group of 10 doctors who call themselves the Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance have said ivermectin is “one of the safest, low-cost, and widely available drugs in the history of medicine.”<br />Ivermectin fights 21 viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the cause of Covid-19. A single dose reduced the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in cells by 99.8% in 24 hours and 99.98% in 48 hours, according to a June 2020 study published in the journal Antiviral Research.</td>

      <td>Covid-19 vaccine sales are still brisk, but the rest of Pfizer’s business is in fine health</td>
      <td>Pfizer ’s  Covid-19 vaccine bonanza isn’t showing signs of slowing down just yet. but second-quarter results out Wednesday suggest shareholders are inoculated for that eventuality.<br />The drugmaker said it expects $33.5 billion in vaccine sales this year, up from a previous outlook of $26 billion. As a result, Pfizer now expects to earn about $4 a share this year, up from about $3.60. That sales outlook could still improve further if Pfizer signs additional contracts with governments. Shares rose slightly in morning trading and are up about 16% so far this year.<br />While that sales figure blows away previous annual single-product records, the vaccines present a valuation challenge for Wall Street. After all, no one knows for sure how long pandemic conditions will last or whether regulators will authorize booster shots for vaccinated individuals. Pharmaceutical investors don’t usually reward cash flows that don’t recur, no matter how enormous.<br />But the performance of Pfizer’s non-Covid-19 business gives real insurance if the vaccines fade away. In that subgroup, sales grew 10% from a year earlier in the second quarter, thanks to brisk sales of products like the blood medication Eliquis and the Prevnar 13 pneumonia vaccine. Pfizer also raised its full-year sales and earnings forecast for its non-Covid-19 business.<br />The pipeline of new drug candidates, which includes an experimental treatment for breast cancer and a Lyme disease vaccine, shows promise. Pfizer has identified eight candidates, each with the potential to generate billions in annual revenue by the end of the decade. And Pfizer can certainly look outside the organization for growth opportunities. After all, its vaccine partnership with BioNTech couldn’t possibly have worked out better.</td>

      <td>Issues still threaten plane maker’s competitive position</td>
      <td>Boeing  is making money again, but regaining its status as an investor darling will take something more.<br />On Wednesday, the Chicago-based plane maker’s stock jumped almost 6% after its surprise announcement of a $567 million profit for the second quarter. It is the first time the company has reported positive net income since the third quarter of 2019, due to the double whammy of the pandemic and the grounding of its 737 MAX jet.<br />Some of the improvement was thanks to higher profit margins in the defense and services divisions, but the commercial-airplane arm also surpassed expectations. It reported a 268% surge in revenues for the period, and—as was already known—logged 180 new net orders including high-profile MAX purchases by  United Airlines  and  Southwest Airlines .  This placed Boeing ahead of its European rival  Airbus .<br />Crucially, Boeing managed to ship 50 737 aircraft in the three months through June, freeing up more of its massive stockpile of undelivered planes. Together with much-needed predelivery payments following the new orders, this reduced Boeing’s quarterly cash bleed to just $705 million. Wall Street was expecting an outflow of almost $3 billion.<br />For Boeing, showing that it could meet its production and delivery targets for the MAX was key. Its share price has significantly trailed Airbus’s over the past few months. Given how many high-profile mishaps the U.S. plane maker has recently been involved in, it was something of a miracle that their five-year performances were roughly the same until recently.</td>

      <td>Barclays  and  Deutsche Bank  are on form right now, but investors need to be cautious of their growing ambitions for the volatile investment-banking business.<br />The big European lenders published solid half-year results Wednesday, benefiting like their U.S. peers from a strong investment-banking market. Both companies have built generous capital buffers since their regulators banned dividends last year. Barclays resumed payouts with a 2 pence a share dividend and £500m buyback, equivalent to $694 million. Deutsche Bank set aside €575 million, equivalent to $678 million, this year for dividends to be paid next year, once its restructuring is complete.<br />Investment banks have saved the day for many lenders during the pandemic, generating bumper profits to offset big loan-loss allowances and lower consumer borrowing. That has emboldened some European lenders to eye growth in their capital-markets businesses again, after years of cuts. While following the money is an understandable strategy, results generated during such an unusual period for the global economy may be an unusually bad guide to future performance.<br />Chief Executive Jes Staley started restructuring Barclays six years ago, culling international retail operations and parts of the investment bank. There was pressure to jettison the whole investment bank, including a vocal campaign by activist shareholder Edward Bramson of Sherborne Investors. The bank’s performance during the pandemic has vindicated Mr. Staley’s strategy. Its global markets business produced results while its credit card and retail divisions struggled.<br />As the recovery picks up speed, there are now plans to “infill” the investment bank, Barclays Chief Financial Officer Tushar Morzaria told analysts, mentioning equity capital markets, securitized products and some new sectors. These could be prudent investments, but expenses have crept up this year and some long-suffering investors may worry the expansion will instead increase risks and the cost base.</td>

He was also fined about 3.1 million yuan, the equivalent of about $405,500.<br />Mr. Sun’s company, Dawu Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Group, had been publicly feuding with a state-owned farm in China’s northern city of Baoding over a long-running land dispute when police detained him, members of his family and other senior Dawu executives in November.<br />Prosecutors formally brought charges in May against Mr. Sun, his company and 19 other defendants, including two brothers and two sons of Mr. Sun. The trial started in July and lasted roughly two weeks, in proceedings that defense lawyers involved say were conducted with unusual urgency.<br />The court said Dawu Group and other defendants were given “corresponding penalties,” but didn’t provide details. Mr. Sun’s 19 fellow defendants were given jail sentences ranging from one to 12 years, while the company was ordered to pay the equivalent of more than $130 million in fines, restitution and refunds for money they were deemed to have raised illegally, their defense team said.</td>

      <td>Cheered at Cannes, the new Matt Damon movie is now rolling the dice on a theaters-only release</td>
      <td>Covid-19 may have created a disaster for theatrical releases and movie theaters, but it turns out the disruption worked out for Tom McCarthy. The director of “Stillwater,” starring Matt Damon as a father trying to get his daughter out of a French prison, says the pandemic delay gave him a chance that studio-backed filmmakers rarely get—to step away from the film for months and come back to sharpen it with fresh eyes.<br />“You never, never get that. Because the studio has put in all this money, and they want the movie to come out,” Mr. McCarthy says. “You’re always looking for distance from the material, and it’s hard to get. This was forced upon us.”<br />He and his production team, many of whom worked with him on the Oscar Best Picture winner “Spotlight,” used the gift of distance to trim scenes, add back moments they had removed, and boost the story’s emotional impact. “We were really aggressive. Nothing got a pass. If something was additive to the film we kept it, and if it wasn’t, we didn’t. I’ll be honest—it turned out to be a silver lining of the Covid interruption.”<br />“Stillwater,” which opens this Friday only in theaters, was originally set to premiere in November 2020—instead it premiered to a standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival this month.<br />Mr. McCarthy had nearly finished making it in March 2020 when the pandemic broke out. “We had just shown it to the studio, and they were very happy with the cut,” he says. “I imagine we would have finished it around June, July [of 2020], so it would have been too late for Cannes, because Cannes is normally in May. We were going to start the final refining, and the world shut down.”</td>

      <td>This recipe gets maximum flavor from rib-eye with minimal time and effort. Roasted piquillo peppers and a simple green salad provide bracing complements.</td>
      <td>A GOOD STEAK requires no sauce, in chef Ryan Bartlow’s opinion. At Ernesto’s in Manhattan, he often serves excellent cuts sauceless and free of fussy sides so diners can better appreciate the meat itself.<br />That’s more or less his approach in his second Slow Food Fast recipe. Here, Mr. Bartlow threads dry-aged rib-eye or strip steak onto skewers and quickly grills the meat until it’s well browned on the exterior and rare to medium-rare within. He serves the skewers simply, with a green salad and a few roasted piquillo peppers.<br />The salad consists of nothing more than fresh lettuce and slivered onions dressed in oil and vinegar. “It’s a palate cleanser,” Mr. Bartlow said. The peppers provide some sweetness and zing. “You don’t need anything else,” he added. “Except maybe some bread and a good bottle of wine.”<br />To let the flavor really shine through, Mr. Bartlow waits until the steak is on the grill to salt it. “I season the meat generously once it starts to sweat. You can use a kosher salt to start if you like. But then, off the grill, I use a coarse salt, like Maldon,” he said.<br />It took Mr. Bartlow years of working in restaurant kitchens (not to mention eating), in Spain and the U.S., to gain the confidence to cook so simply. “It’s about the meat. It’s about preserving traditions from the Basque region,” he said. “This is how it’s done there, and it’s food served with pride. Why change it?”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—President Biden on Wednesday issued a new directive instructing federal agencies to develop voluntary cybersecurity goals for companies that operate U.S. critical infrastructure, a move that came as senior officials said the administration was exploring the possibility of pursuing mandatory standards.<br />The effort is the latest by the Biden administration attempting to shore up the nation’s defenses against disruptive cyberattacks, an area the president and his senior aides repeatedly have said is a top national security threat especially after several recent high-profile ransomware attacks disrupted cornerstones of American life and business.<br />The new national security memorandum directs the Department of Homeland Security’s cyber wing and the National Institute of Standards and Technology at the Commerce Department to work with other federal agencies to develop cybersecurity performance goals for critical infrastructure operators and owners, a senior administration official said. Text of the memorandum wasn’t immediately available.<br />Last week, the Transportation Security Administration handed down new cybersecurity requirements for U.S. pipeline operators intended to help guard against ransomware and other forms of disruptive hacking. The requirements were announced months after a Russia-based criminal hacking group forced a major fuel conduit on the East Coast, operated by Colonial Pipeline, to shut down for nearly a week. And In May, Mr. Biden issued an executive order that established baseline cybersecurity requirements for U.S. agencies and their software contractors, including mandates to use multifactor authentication and data encryption, and that requires federal information technology vendors to disclose certain data about hacks.<br />“We’ve seen how cyber threats, including ransomware attacks, increasingly are able to cause damage and destruction in the real world,” Mr. Biden said Tuesday during a visit to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. “If we end up in a war, a real shooting war, with a major power, it’s going to be as a consequence of a cyber breach of great consequence.”</td>

Yet despite having more access than is typical of such trading events, many individual investors are still saying: No thanks.<br />Across social-media platforms like Reddit, Twitter and Discord lately, talk of Robinhood’s IPO has heated up, with many individual investors encouraging their peers to avoid it. For some, the decision is a revenge play after the brokerage stopped users from buying meme stocks like  GameStop Corp.  during the height of the frenzy this year.</td>

      <td>China’s government is planning to introduce new laws in Hong Kong and Macau that could bar foreign entities and individuals in the cities from complying with sanctions against China, according to people familiar with the discussions.<br />The new laws are expected to mirror China’s own “antiforeign sanctions law,” which Beijing rushed through in June in response to sanctions imposed on the country by the U.S. and Europe, the people said.<br />China’s official Xinhua News Agency reported on Tuesday that the country’s legislature was scheduled to add provisions to the mini-constitutions of Hong Kong and Macau during a four-day session beginning Aug. 17, though it didn’t specify what changes would be made.<br />The introduction of the law in the two Chinese territories, especially in the financial hub of Hong Kong, could leave many companies and their employees caught in the middle as China and the U.S. clash over the future of the former British colony.<br />“The real conflict, which is what people are really concerned with, are cases where companies are obliged to follow a sanction and there is a prohibition against complying with it in Hong Kong,” said Nicholas Turner, a lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson LLP who specializes in economic sanctions.</td>

      <td>The Delta variant of the virus that causes Covid-19 is often described as highly transmissible. So, what does that actually mean?<br />Scientists studying Covid-19 say that Delta’s increased contagiousness means we need to update our thinking about exposure risks. Because people infected with Delta carry higher levels of virus than with earlier strains, the old rules of thumb no longer apply, they say—including the conventional wisdom that it takes 15 minutes of close contact with someone to get infected.<br />Delta has already changed public-health advice about masking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday recommended that vaccinated people resume masking indoors in certain parts of the country. And local officials have begun to reinstate mask mandates, including in Los Angeles County and St. Louis County.<br />CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said the guidelines were revised because new data on the Delta variant show that so-called breakthrough infections for fully vaccinated people, though rare, carry a similar level of viral load as infections among the unvaccinated.<br />Here’s what scientists say we need to know about how Delta changes our risk calculus.</td>

      <td>Yields on government bonds in the U.S. and Europe have dropped to record lows when adjusted for inflation, a sign of investors’ waning optimism about the global economic recovery.<br />The yield on the 10-year Treasury inflation-protected security, or TIPS, finished Tuesday’s session at minus 1.132%, according to Tradeweb. That is the lowest close on record, in data going back to February 2003, and down from Monday’s minus 1.118% close.<br />Yields, which fall when bond prices rise, have also declined to new lows this week on inflation-protected securities in Germany and the U.K. The yield on the 10-year German inflation-protected note fell to minus 1.775% Tuesday, a record low, while the yield on the U.K.’s 10-year inflation-protected gilt rose to minus 2.868%, just below Monday’s record-low close at minus 2.893%.<br />Yields on inflation-protected government bonds are considered proxies for so-called real yields—or the expected return that investors can get on either nominal or inflation-adjusted government bonds when accounting for expected inflation. Holders of TIPS are compensated with additional principal and coupon payments as the consumer-price index rises, meaning they will out-earn holders of nominal Treasurys if inflation exceeds expectations but earn less if prices don’t rise as much as expected.<br />Analysts say the decline in real yields is one sign that investors around the world are paring bets on a rapid recovery. While prospects are improving for advanced economies, low vaccination rates have left emerging and developing countries more vulnerable to economic fallout from additional waves of the pandemic, according to a recent International Monetary Fund report.</td>

In addition to Wharton, those seven elite schools include Harvard Business School, Stanford’s Graduate School of Business, Columbia Business School, MIT Sloan School of Management, Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management and the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business.<br />Over the past 15 years, the number of women enrolled in M.B.A. programs has steadily increased. In 2005, women made up less than 30% of students enrolled in roughly 50 full-time M.B.A. programs tracked by the Forté Foundation in the year that the nonprofit started to tally gender. By 2020, female enrollment in M.B.A. programs stood at 39%, according to Forte Foundation, which focuses on advancing women into leadership roles through access to business education.<br />Women have historically had more representation in other graduate disciplines and make up the majority of law school and medical school students, according to the American Bar Association and Association of American Medical Colleges. Women have also earned the majority of bachelor’s degrees in the U.S. since the early 1980s, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.</td>

      <td>To ease the transition from lockdown sweats to more-tailored fare, some men are taking a page out of Detective Sonny Crockett’s book and wearing casual T-shirts—not stuffy button-downs—under their sport coats</td>
      <td>BEN HELMS DIDN’T want to wear a dress shirt. Last month, the 28-year-old, who works in tech sales in Chicago, was attending his first wedding since the onset of Covid. He picked out a handsome golden-brown suit from Bonobos for the occasion, but instead of starting with a formal button-up, Mr. Helms slipped a Uniqlo T-shirt underneath the suit. The unconventional wedding outfit garnered some ribbing from other guests—more than a few called him “Miami Vice”—but Mr. Helms has no regrets about opting for dressed-down ease. “I felt like the T-shirt under gave that sense of ‘I’m put together, but it’s not overly formal,’” he said.<br />This summer, men like Mr. Helms are tossing their sport coats and suit jackets over T-shirts as a way of gingerly revisiting their closets’ tailoring sections. Thomas Lavin, 25, who works in tech sales in Boston, has lately been wearing a navy blazer over T-shirts as a way “to get out of my comfort zone a bit.” Many of us have gravitated toward cushy sweats and serviceable Zoom button-ups this past year. Putting a blazer on, even over a simple white T-shirt, marks a clear move toward really dressing up again.<br />This tee-and-tailoring look will always be most associated with the 1980s TV character Sonny Crockett who, as played by Don Johnson in “Miami Vice,” battled crime along the Florida coast while wearing precipitously scoop-neck T-shirts and pastel suits. But many of the suit-and-tee fans I interviewed cited another inspiration: Eric Clapton. In the ’80s and ’90s, Mr. Clapton came to favor fine-gauge T-shirts and sloping sport coats, often by Italian maestro Giorgio Armani. Mr. Clapton’s T-shirts sat higher around the neck than Mr. Crockett’s, for a more professional look, and his suits—while still oversize—weren’t clownish.<br />Today, nostalgic social media accounts frequently post old photos of Mr. Clapton and other pre-Y2K adherents of the suit-and-tee. The much-followed Instagram account @NightOpenings uploads images of red carpet openings from the ’90s. On it you can find shots of Keanu Reeves, Blair Underwood and Christian Slater attending premieres in roomy tee-and-suit rigs. These men don’t appear to have been forced into unnatural outfits by a celebrity stylist the way current stars, sealed into their slim suits and ties, often do. Keanu and crew look convincingly at ease.<br />Perfecting this look requires an eye for minutiae. Adam Tunji, 28, a creative producer in New York, avoids any sport coats with a hint of padding, which he believes make you look “like you’re wearing your dad’s old jacket.” This summer he’s been wearing a black unlined cotton sport coat over a T-shirt nearly every day. It’s a pared-back outfit that’s cool in more ways than one: “I’m running around today in a Breton-stripe tee and a blue blazer because it’s just so hot that I’m not comfortable in a dress shirt anymore,” he said.</td>

      <td>Uber Eats and DoorDash may be able to best Just Eat Takeaway.com in Germany, but doing so will cost them</td>
      <td>Both  Uber Technologies ’ Uber Eats and  DoorDash  appear to have their sights set on the German market—a unique one controlled by a single player amid a global land grab in food delivery. An activist presentation this week shows Germany’s allure isn’t necessarily its diners but the ability to weaken a vulnerable incumbent.<br />Uber confirmed its German entry in April and, while DoorDash hasn’t formally announced its plans, the company is now hiring for at least 40 positions in the country, according to LinkedIn. Before entering Germany, Uber Eats was already in 13 countries across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. For DoorDash, the U.S. market leader, Germany will be its first foray into Europe. On LinkedIn, Uber refers to the German market as “a multibillion-dollar greenfield opportunity” and “highly strategic in the wider European competitive landscape.”<br />But the country’s market dynamics make it an odd choice for a new face-off between the top two U.S. food-delivery players. For one thing, data shows Germans typically order less often, have small basket sizes and might be more price sensitive than consumers in other markets. At the same time, some operating costs could be higher. German regulations require drivers to be employed by fleet-management companies rather than to contract with gig economy companies directly. Such rules can add costs and make expanding beyond major cities difficult, Uber’s senior vice president of delivery noted in a Financial Times interview earlier this year.<br />DoorDash would likely have to employ a different game plan than the one it used in the U.S. to tap into underserved suburbia with tremendous success. Germany has only four cities with a population of over 1 million. Meanwhile, quick-service chain restaurants aren’t as popular in Germany as they are in the U.S. So DoorDash’s strategy of using delivery for those restaurants to hook new customers outside major cities might not appeal to Germans in the same way.<br />Amsterdam-based Just Eat Takeaway.com NV commanded an estimated 99% market share in Germany as of June, YipitData show. It isn’t as though other companies haven’t tried. In 2019, U.K.-based delivery platform  Deliveroo  bailed out of the market. In 2018 Berlin-based  Delivery Hero  agreed to sell its German operations to Takeaway.com (which later merged with Just Eat) but announced in May an official relaunch in Germany this year under the company’s foodpanda brand.</td>

      <td>It will be difficult for Robinhood to both deliver huge gains to its customers and also show itself to be a major future IPO player</td>
      <td>Initial public offerings can be a little bit like politics: A decent outcome may be when everyone is only a little bit unhappy. The question is whether even that will be achievable for Robinhood Markets.<br />This week the app-first broker is on track to complete its long-awaited IPO, and it has said it might set aside as much as 35% of the offering for its customers. That is a historically large amount, and these kinds of debuts have long been sought after—but for conflicting reasons. Small investors believe they should be able to enjoy the same IPO “pop” on discounted offering shares that institutions and wealthy individuals get, while many companies believe they should be able to sell their shares as widely as possible in order to get the highest price possible.<br />In theory, Robinhood is uniquely positioned to thread this needle. If it priced the deal at a very high point, reflecting big demand from small investors who aren’t very price sensitive, that would showcase Robinhood as a platform for other issuers looking to raise maximum capital, making it potentially a bigger player in the IPO business. Yet that might risk generating only a small pop, or even a fizzle, for customers of its retail platform.<br />But if Robinhood was willing to risk leaving some money on the table, it could price the deal well below where retail demand would cover it, and leave plenty of room for the stock to jump in the aftermarket. That would showcase Robinhood’s potential to customers seeking out future IPOs and perhaps create a sense of sharing-the-wealth with its wide audience of small investors. But it might not endear Robinhood to its existing investors and other issuers and their backers.<br />Perhaps Robinhood and its bankers can find a happy medium. After all, some of an IPO’s pop is likely attributable to big institutions buying in the market after getting allocated only a portion of what they asked for in the deal. Leaving them wanting more might help the first-day gains. Then again, if institutions decide to try to sell their relatively small allocations, or if retail demand in the open market is muted because so many small investors already got stock, it might damp those gains. A “pop” of 10% or 20%, rather than the shares skyrocketing, might just make everyone feel like they got something.</td>

Massive water pumps emptied out flooded underpasses and rescuers fished out waterlogged cars and, in a few cases, dead bodies.<br />On Thursday, a convenience store next to the Haitansi Road subway station, where many people died in the floods, was packed with people charging electronic devices. On the street, vendors sold fruit and discount sneakers, while families in the vicinity, with no electricity or running water at home, loitered in the summer air.<br />By Saturday, riot police were standing guard at a number of key intersections and around hospitals in Zhengzhou, a city of 11 million on the edge of the Yellow River. Police and security guards kept a tight cordon around underpasses, tunnels and pedestrian footbridges along the Jingguang highway, where most of the worst flooding took place, with passersby ordered not to take photos.<br />At several of the most heavily affected parts of the city, foreign reporters, including The Wall Street Journal’s, were questioned by police and told that they couldn’t report on the flood response or talk to locals without going through official channels.</td>

      <td>MOSCOW—Challenging Vladimir Putin has always been difficult. Now his opponents say it is almost impossible, as the Kremlin launches a full-court press against anyone daring to stand up against the Russian president.<br />In recent weeks, authorities have stepped up a campaign to suppress critics and organizations seen as being antigovernment ahead of parliamentary elections in the fall. Opposition leaders have been detained, human rights and legal groups forced to disband and independent media organizations sidelined on an almost weekly basis since the April jailing of Alexei Navalny, Russia’s best-known dissident, who earlier survived a nerve agent attack.<br />For some political commentators and Kremlin-watchers, the clampdown is further evidence that Mr. Putin’s regime is growing stronger, despite social discontent over the economy and Western sanctions for its alleged transgressions, including human-rights abuses.<br />He doesn’t appear to feel threatened by the opposition or pressure from the U.S. and cares little about appeasing the public, analysts said. Authorities instead appear willing to use a range of tools to quash any space for organizing street protests or investigating the financial affairs of Mr. Putin and his inner circle, they said.<br />“It shows that Putin is now very confident in himself and he can rely on force, believing that it isn’t necessary to make some kind of trade-off between the society and the government,” said Vladislav Inozemtsev, director of the Moscow-based Center for Post-Industrial Studies, a nonprofit think tank.</td>

The bonds are backed by short-term loans the bank makes to mortgage lenders. When those lenders’ borrowers default, the investors in the bonds effectively cover the loss.<br />The transfers are a product of the effort to shield  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  from the risk of a mortgage-market reversal. Banks are now using them to raise capital and otherwise shore up their balance sheets, a process that ultimately adds to their lending capacity, analysts said.<br />Banks including  JPMorgan Chase  & Co. and  Citigroup Inc.  have recently increased sales of risk-transfer securities tied to mortgages, auto loans and corporate debt. However, the entry of regional banks marks a new phase in the market’s expansion, said Simon Boughey, an analyst at Structured Credit Investor.<br />“The addition of Texas Capital Bank to the roster in March this year shows there is potential for this mechanism to grow,” said Mr. Boughey.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is proposing a rule that would accelerate federal procurement policy to require a higher level of American-made products.<br />Under an initiative to be announced Wednesday, the government would require that products obtained under the longstanding “Buy American” program have at least 60% of the value of components made in the U.S., up from the current 55% threshold. That would increase to 75% by 2029, White House officials said.<br />President Biden is expected to discuss the proposal during a visit Wednesday to a Mack Trucks plant in Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state that he narrowly won in 2020 following Donald Trump’s victory there in 2016.<br />The proposal aims to strengthen compliance by requiring contractors to prove that the products they purchase on behalf of the government meet the content threshold. Currently, contractors tell the government if they meet that standard, according to administration officials.<br />“This proposal would close a problematic loophole in the current regulation, while also allowing businesses time to adjust their supply chains to increase the use of American-made components,” according to a White House fact sheet.</td>

Still, net profit surged compared with last year as its business lines held better than expected and the economic rebound in Germany put a lid on souring loans.<br />With the investment-banking business normalizing as the pandemic effects subside, focus will increasingly fall on the performance in its bread-and-butter lending business. Also important to investors: progress on its effort to cut costs.<br />Those cuts in particular are facing headwinds. Deutsche Bank on Wednesday dropped a specific 2022 cost-cutting target following unexpected regulatory levies that threw off its calculations. Its commitment to cut 18,000 jobs by 2022 has also loosened. Instead, the bank said it will focus on cost relative to income.<br />“There is no change in commitment and focus on costs,” Mr. von Moltke told reporters.</td>

Directors declared an ordinary dividend of $3.76 a share, up from $1.55 a share a year earlier. They also unveiled a special dividend of $1.85 a share.</td>

I am sorry that we did not provide the right empathy and understanding.”<br />The suit, which was filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing last week, accuses the largest U.S. videogame publisher by market value of paying female employees less than their male counterparts and providing them with fewer opportunities to advance. It also alleges that Activision ignored complaints by female employees of blatant harassment, discrimination and retaliation.<br />Activision is fighting the charges. It previously said the lawsuit includes distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of its past. The company said it strives to pay all employees fairly.<br />More than 3,000 current and former employees digitally signed a letter to leaders of Activision that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal in which they called the company’s response to the lawsuit “abhorrent and insulting.” The letter also called for immediate action “from the highest level of our organization.”</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Justice Department said it wouldn’t defend Rep. Mo Brooks (R., Ala.) against a lawsuit alleging he helped incite the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, concluding the congressman wasn’t acting in his official capacity when he encouraged pro-Trump demonstrators to “start taking down names and kicking ass” at a rally shortly beforehand.<br />“The record indicates that Brooks’s appearance at the January 6 rally was campaign activity, and it is no part of the business of the United States to pick sides among candidates in federal elections,” Justice Department officials wrote in a court filing Tuesday evening. “Members of Congress are subject to a host of restrictions that carefully distinguish between their official functions, on the one hand, and campaign functions, on the other. The conduct at issue here thus is not the kind a Member of Congress holds office to perform.”<br />Rep. Eric Swalwell (D. Calif.) sued Mr. Brooks in March along with former President Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and the elder Mr. Trump’s former lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, saying they conspired to incite riot and prevent Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election. Mr. Brooks, a close ally of Mr. Trump, argued in court documents that the Justice Department should take over his defense, as he was acting as a member of Congress at a political rally. The move would have substituted the U.S. as a defendant in the case.<br />Mr. Brooks on Tuesday called the Justice Department’s conclusion that his speech was campaign activity “wholly and completely false.” He said that he had been “asked by the White House to give a speech—that’s what we congressmen do.” Mr. Brooks said that “the facts and the law are clearly on my side and I will definitely appeal any adverse decision by the trial court judge.”<br />In its Tuesday filing, the Justice Department said, “Brooks engaged in conduct that, if proven, would plainly fall outside the scope of employment for an officer or employee of the United States: conspiring to prevent the lawful certification of the 2020 election and to injure Members of Congress and inciting the riot at the Capitol.”</td>

Halfway through this year, the city is on pace to match that number, police data show. Ms. Bowser was part of a delegation that met with President Biden earlier in July to discuss efforts to curb gun violence.<br />City residents have been rattled by several recent shootings, including a drive-by shooting in which a 6-year-old was killed, the wounding of two men during the dinner hour at a popular restaurant, and a shooting outside Nationals Park that led to a Major League Baseball game being suspended.<br />Ms. Bowser has proposed more than $214 million over four years to address gun violence, according to her 2022 budget. She said she was increasingly optimistic that the D.C. council would approve $3.4 million to add 100 new slots to the police training academy, in the face of calls to reduce police funding.</td>

Swvl was co-founded in 2017 by Mostafa Kandil, who formerly worked at ride-sharing company Careem, which is now a subsidiary of  Uber Technologies Inc.<br />Swvl operates mainly in the Middle East and Africa, providing ride-sharing in areas where mass transit is plagued by poor reliability. Its algorithms and technology help make rides and routes more efficient. The company targets a different type of user than, say, Uber, focusing more on customers who lack other options to and from work and school. It has plans to expand to Latin America as well as Europe.<br />The Queen’s Gambit SPAC, whose name is a nod to an opening sequence in chess as well as the fact that it’s led by women, raised $300 million in January. At the time, the SPAC said it was looking to invest in a target company with a focus on sustainability in the sector of clean energy, healthcare, mobility or industrials, among others.<br />A group of investors including Agility, Luxor Capital Group LP and Zain Group, a mobile voice and data services operator across the Middle East and Africa, plan to put in another roughly $100 million through a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, associated with the deal, the people said.</td>

Beta Bridge, painted by students in a longstanding UVA tradition, was painted over the summer with “ACAB”—short for “all cops are bastards.” The Washington and Jefferson societies barely hold formal debates anymore; any disagreement with current woke standards is unacceptable. Students feel compelled to fall in line or risk being ostracized.<br />The prestigious lawn rooms, once a place for a UVA class to house and display the best of its students, have been co-opted by a vocal activist class. One student living there, angry with the administration for not restructuring the school’s Academical Village—part of a Unesco World Heritage site—in light of her temporary ankle injury, affixed a “F— UVA” sign to her door and listed the reasons the school is awash in bigotry: “UVA operating costs—KKKops, Genocide, Slavery, Disability, Black and Brown Life.” Within a week, probably half the students living in the lawn rooms had the same “F— UVA” signs and systematic-racism banners pinned to their doors. That is their right, but I wonder why so many of the students selected as the university’s top scholars and leaders believe displaying obscenities on their doors, simply because someone else did, will lead to productive dialogue and improved race relations.</td>

      <td>The FDA should move faster on final approval to reassure the public.</td>
      <td>The Covid-19 Delta variant and public vaccine resistance have reignited the debate over mandates, and it may get heated. It’s important to make distinctions between government and private mandates, and it would help if the Food and Drug Administration finally expedited full approval of the clearly successful mRNA vaccines.<br />How to handle the 30% or so of adults who haven’t been vaccinated has taken on more urgency as the Delta variant spreads and the U.S. heads toward flu season. U.S. hospitalizations have doubled in a month and tripled in California, where some 78% of adults have received at least one vaccine dose. Covid will never be eradicated, but the threshold for herd immunity has increased because the Delta variant is more transmissible.<br />Vaccines are highly effective at preventing severe disease, but the virus risk to the elderly and people with chronic conditions isn’t zero. In April the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that an unvaccinated worker at a Kentucky nursing home caused an outbreak that infected 18 fully vaccinated residents. Two were hospitalized, and one died. The legitimate concern is that hospitals could get overwhelmed again this winter as the seasonal flu is likely to be more prevalent with lockdowns lifted and schools open. Governments and health-care providers have a strong interest in ensuring that frontline workers in particular are vaccinated.<br />Thus the call for vaccine mandates, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday mandated shots for hospital, nursing home and state workers. Those who refuse must be tested at least once a week, which makes the order less compulsory. New York City is requiring city workers to get vaccinated, and many private hospitals, including the Mayo Clinic and Houston Methodist, have announced mandates.<br />Some of our friends on the right say workers should be free to make their own decisions, and in a free society that should be the default. No government should order the general public to take a vaccine except in cases of the most extreme health danger.</td>

      <td>A GAO report shows how much relief cash remains unspent.</td>
      <td>Congress has spent so much money in the past year that the recipients are having a hard time using it. That’s the news from a Government Accountability Office report last week that more than $1 trillion of federal pandemic relief has yet to be spent.<br />The biggest cache is grants to states, cities and territories, of which $210 billion remains unspent. That’s no surprise given the $500 billion showered on states and cities between the March 2020 Cares Act and President Biden’s follow-up in March 2021.<br />The bailout came despite a mere 0.2% drop in state revenue from 2019 to 2020, according to the Tax Foundation. Few strings are attached to the funds so state and local lawmakers are taking their time. New York, California and others have passed record budgets while tapping only a portion of their federal aid.<br />The next great unspent cash pile is at the Department of Health and Human Services. Congress rushed $324 billion to HHS during the first waves of the pandemic, of which the GAO says only half has been spent. That didn’t stop Mr. Biden from adding another $160 billion this year, only $3 billion of which has gone out the door. One HHS program, the Provider Relief Fund, has largely halted its spending since vaccinations reduced Covid hospitalizations. The last reimbursements to hospitals through the fund were in January, says the Healthcare Financial Management Association.<br />The outline of the bipartisan Senate infrastructure deal proposed to divert cash from the Provider Relief Fund, along with unused unemployment insurance. The American Hospital Association hit back in a letter to Senate leaders, saying the plan to divert funds “denies the seriousness” of Covid-19. Negotiations continue, and if Senators are really serious about “paying for” the new spending, unspent Covid funds are the obvious source to tap.</td>

      <td>The politics of American foreign policy are reverting to their modern norms, illustrated by two recent Biden administration decisions and the attendant reactions. Donald Trump’s idiosyncrasies and the Democratic opposition produced some aberrations in the traditional positions of the two major parties, confounding allies and adversaries alike. Now, Republicans and Democrats are essentially reverting to the status quo ante.<br />Last week, responding to Chinese hacking of  Microsoft ’s  email systems, Washington orchestrated pronouncements by European Union and North Atlantic Treaty Organization members condemning the attacks. The statements, however, were not uniformly critical of Beijing’s actions.<br />These statements amounted to little more than what diplomats call “a stiff note.” More significantly, at least publicly and to date, there have been no retaliatory measures: no sanctions (unlike after recent cyberattacks by Russian entities) and no cyber response. The White House press briefer uttered the palpably false words “We are not holding back.” Of course they were, and Beijing understood it.<br />Mr. Biden also acquiesced to the completion of Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The administration had previously said it opposed the project, even while waiving sanctions that could have crippled it. (Mr. Trump also had opportunities to stop the pipeline, but didn’t.) Mr. Biden’s final surrender means the U.S. is done trying to stop Nord Stream 2.<br />In both cases, there was immediate criticism. Republicans were dismayed by Mr. Biden’s flaccid answer to China’s cyberattacks and incandescent about Nord Stream 2. Had these same decisions been made by Mr. Trump, Democrats would have taken the offensive, accusing Mr. Trump of coddling Xi Jinping and reprising the clamor about “Russian collusion.”</td>

That represents the best growth the iPhone has seen in six years for what is typically its weakest seasonal quarter, as many buyers begin waiting to make purchases ahead of new devices that typically debut in the early fall.<br />Wall Street expects Apple to close its fiscal year in September with record iPhone revenue of nearly $187 billion, which would make its phone segment alone the 10th largest business on the S&P 500. But a funny thing has happened over the past few years: The iPhone has also become a notably smaller part of Apple’s business. At the smartphone’s last sales peak in fiscal 2018, the iPhone represented 62% of the company’s total revenue. For the trailing 12-month period ended in June, that number was 52%.<br />For that performance, Apple can thank its supporting cast across the board. Sales of iPads, Macs and wearables like the Apple Watch and AirPods have boomed over the past three quarters, while service revenue growth also picked up. Macs and iPads were definitely helped by the work-from-home trend sparked by the pandemic, but Apple also made some timely and notable updates to both lineups—including new in-house chips for several of its Mac models. Combined Mac sales for the last three quarters have totaled $26 billion—up 33% from the same period last year.<br />That’s a helpful trend for Apple as it heads into what will likely be a much more subdued sales cycle for the iPhone. Last year’s iPhone 12 models, which featured a new design and 5G connectivity for the first time, sparked a major upgrade push. Analysts estimate that Apple sold 186 million iPhone units for the nine-month period ended June, up 26% from the same period last year, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha. But Apple typically follows major upgrades with minor ones. Analysts expect iPhone unit sales to be flat in Apple’s 2022 fiscal year following a 22% surge for the current one.</td>

      <td>The conservative radio host leads all other candidates, but a majority will have to reject the incumbent first.</td>
      <td>Why shouldn’t a conservative Republican like Larry Elder be leading the race to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom?<br />Mr. Elder is an attorney, bestselling author, documentary filmmaker and successful talk-radio host who was born and raised in Los Angeles. True, he’s an amateur when it comes to electoral politics, but look at what the professionals like Mr. Newsom, a liberal Democrat, have done to the most populous state.<br />Crime has climbed in California’s largest cities, while left-wing district attorneys compete to determine who can prosecute the fewest miscreants. The state’s homelessness rate is third highest in the country after Hawaii and New York, and it’s rising, which might have something to do with heavy-handed zoning restrictions and environmental regulations that limit the construction of affordable housing. Californians pay energy bills that are significantly higher than the national average and well above what customers pay in neighboring states like Oregon. Yet millions of residents experienced rolling blackouts in 2019 when a state utility purposely cut off power to avoid wildfires caused by outdated electric lines. And that’s what life was like in this progressive Eden before the pandemic.<br />Mr. Elder told me in an interview this week that the state’s over-the-top Covid response and the governor’s aristocratic personal behavior probably did more than anything else to put his job in jeopardy. In a CNN interview last year, Mr. Newsom implied that his children, who attend private school, were still learning remotely. In reality, they had returned to in-person instruction months earlier, while the public schools remained closed in deference to the state’s powerful teachers unions.<br />Nor has Mr. Newsom been able to live down his infamous private dinner at a fancy French restaurant in defiance of his own Covid restrictions, Mr. Elder said. “People are angry that the state was shut down in such a severe way during the pandemic while this man was sitting in a restaurant with lobbyists and healthcare professionals—violating the very mandates they wrote.” It wasn’t the only example of the rules not applying to the governor, said Mr. Elder. Mr. Newsom’s own winery in Napa County remained open last year while he ordered other wineries and businesses across the state to close their indoor operations.</td>

      <td>A new variant invites a rethink of our bumpy road to Covid being a low-risk nuisance.</td>
      <td>U.S. authorities are getting another chance at mask advice with the upwelling of the Delta variant. Will they get it right this time—by which I mean achieving not an angry social meme but giving guidance that will actually have good practical effect?<br />Reduced to a nugget of precision, the best words right now might be: If you are an unvaccinated or otherwise vulnerable person, keep a distance from people who aren’t wearing masks.<br />Everything else is fine print. If you are a vaccinated person going about your business in most respects, it is not your job to compensate for others’ unwillingness to be vaccinated. If you are attending on a vulnerable person, wear a mask. Because children under 12 are not eligible for the vaccine and are at extremely low risk from Covid, their caregivers should be vaccinated or find other work.<br />The Delta variant has collided with our lousy monitoring system, based on biased voluntary testing to tell us how many have gotten Covid.<br />Delta is clearly spreading among the fully vaccinated, but we have no idea how extensively because people with mild or asymptomatic cases are unlikely to seek testing.</td>

      <td>One of the most trusted authorities on what we put inside ourselves pens a trio of lively essays about opium, caffeine and mescaline.</td>
      <td>If the chief perils of a drug include its effects on the heart and mind, then in the view of many monarchs, coffee must have been the most dangerous drug humans ever produced. The sites of its consumption nurtured historical revolutions from Paris to Cairo. Charles II of England sought to ban coffeehouses (and the highly caffeinated political squabbles therein) for “Disturbance of the Quiet and Peace of the Realm,” while Frederick II hired unemployed veterans as Kaffeeschnüffler (coffee sniffers) to follow the aroma toward unpatriotic Prussians who violated the law in their preference for coffee over beer.<br />Flash forward to the present, where coffee and its caffeinated ilk fuel activities as various as AA meetings, political campaigns (both for and against the “Quiet and Peace of the Realm”), standardized test-taking, Amazon warehouses (where coffee and tea are free) and professional athletic performance—permitted by the World Anti-Doping Agency despite reams of studies on its enhancement of exercise capacity. Have we bent this little molecule, 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine, to our will, or has it rather bent us to its? Standing on the slopes of a coffee plantation in Colombia, thinking of the 27 million other acres devoted to the crop, Michael Pollan thinks the plants have won, tricking an “especially clever primate” into “heroic feats of industriousness, many of which ultimately redound to the benefit of the plant itself.”<br />Although foods and drugs are arguably the most health-changing things we select or accept for our bodies’ care, much of contemporary science and medicine is shockingly muddled as to what these categories even mean. As Mr. Pollan points out in “This Is Your Mind on Plants,” the Food and Drug Administration offers only “a circular definition of drugs as ‘articles other than food’ that are recognized in the pharmacopoeia.” And very little is taught about “food” at all to doctors, dentists and nurses in training—the majority of U.S. medical schools offer less than the profession’s mandated hours of nutritional instruction, and data show that other health professions, and other nations, fare little better. So drugs are non-foods, and foods are . . . also a black box, packed tight with fears, fads, hopes and misinformation.<br />In the absence of much “official” big-picture thinking about the natures of foods and of drugs from either the public sector or the healthcare professions, Mr. Pollan has become one of the most trusted voices about what we put inside ourselves. Unflappably curious, clear and diligent, the journalist and science writer perhaps reached maximum cultural prominence with the mantra of his anti-diet diet “In Defense of Food” (2008): “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” He generated still more frisson several books later, with “How to Change Your Mind” (2018), a work advocating for the judicious use of psychedelics for “the temporary dissolution of one’s ego” and a more childlike or spiritual immediacy in the world.<br />Now, in his latest book, Mr. Pollan moves back to the group-portrait style of his early hit, “Botany of Desire” (2001), which devoted sumptuous attention in turn to tulips, cannabis, apples and potatoes. He divides “This Is Your Mind on Plants” into three self-contained long essays, each devoted to a singularly alluring psychoactive plant.</td>

      <td>Report could come as soon as Thursday, is likely to focus on bank’s risk management unit, human errors in judgment and unheeded risk</td>
      <td>Credit Suisse  Group AG is likely to publish an investigation as soon as Thursday into the breakdown that led to massive losses from family office Archegos Capital Management, people familiar with the matter said.<br />The detailed report could become public around the time Credit Suisse reports second-quarter earnings, the people said. The report focuses on problems in the bank’s risk management unit, human errors in judgment and unheeded risk in concentrated positions, some of the people said.<br />It is expected to detail the bank’s failures, similar to lengthy reviews around other major bank losses, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s $6 billion trading loss, known as the “London Whale,” and Wells Fargo & Co.’s sales practices scandal.<br />The collapse of Archegos, piled on top of the insolvency of another key Credit Suisse client, Greensill Capital, plunged the storied Swiss lender into crisis earlier this year. Credit Suisse took the biggest hit on Wall Street from Archegos—more than $5.5 billion.<br />Credit Suisse ousted its chief risk officer, investment bank head and others and turned to investors for $2 billion in fresh capital to shore up the bank’s balance sheet. The Swiss regulator, Finma, opened civil enforcement proceedings against Credit Suisse. Regulators in the U.S. and the U.K. are probing the losses from Archegos at multiple banks, the Journal previously reported.</td>
