      <td>If you want to revolutionize the U.S. banking system, should you be in charge of regulating it? Apparently Democrats think so, as they rally to defend President Biden’s nominee for Comptroller of the Currency, Saule Omarova.<br />Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown accuses Pennsylvania’s Pat Toomey of “red scare McCarthyism” for drawing attention to Ms. Omarova’s academic papers and statements. Ms. Omarova advocates central political control of capital, credit and wages, and she has praised the Soviet-era economic system. Are her own words off-limits to scrutiny?</td>

      <td>After Pennsylvania’s 2020 election mess, the state Supreme Court needs an injection of judicial restraint, and Judge Kevin Brobson wants to deliver the first dose. The Nov. 2 ballot includes a partisan election for an open seat on the high court. Judge Brobson, who sits on an appeals bench a step lower, is the GOP nominee. His website says he’ll defend “the law as it is written.”<br />That’s exactly what the state’s Supreme Court did not do last year. State law clearly says mail ballots must be received by 8 p.m. on Election Day. Yet two months before the vote, a 4-3 majority conjured a Covid-19 exception: Mail ballots that arrived three days late would be valid, even without a postmark.</td>

Even more fitting is that the first honoree is Laurence Silberman of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.<br />Judge Silberman has taken senior status but continues to hear cases at age 86. He is one of the all-time giants of the federal bench, and he may be the most influential judge never to have sat on the Supreme Court.

That changed on Oct. 25, 1971, when the General Assembly voted to admit delegates from the People’s Republic of China. The Republic of China lost its seat and has been on the outside looking in ever since. Resolution 2758 marked the beginning of Beijing’s assault on Taiwan’s international status.<br />In 1970 Beijing’s supporters in the U.N. faced an uphill battle. Only a year later the proposal passed in a landslide. What changed? In July of that year, President Richard Nixon revealed that national security adviser Henry Kissinger had visited Beijing, that Nixon himself would do so before May 1972, and that the latter meeting would “seek the normalization of relations between the two countries.”</td>

Caracas’s former financial go-between was detained by police in Cape Verde in 2020 on an Interpol arrest order. In retaliation for the extradition, Mr. Maduro immediately sent six former employees of Citgo, who were under house arrest, to the notorious Helicoide prison.<br />Venezuela is right to be worried but not about mere embezzlement charges. In any attempt to prove before a court that the country runs a transnational criminal organization out of the Miraflores presidential palace and uses it to destabilize democracies in the region, Mr. Saab would be a perfect witness for the prosecution.</td>

Law’s Banque Générale, later renamed Banque Royale, issued bank notes out of thin air, then royally blew up in 1720 and destroyed the French economy. The reputation of French banks has never fully recovered.<br />Law’s connections gave him exclusive rights to trade between France and its Louisiana Territory. The Mississippi Co. was funded by selling new shares of Banque Générale that could be paid for with bank notes issued by—wait for it—Banque Générale. Shares took off, rising from 500 livres to 10,000 livres from January to December 1719. Soldiers had to be sent in to keep order in the frenzied financial district.</td>

City College was singled out this past month by the annual Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education College Rankings for being the top “Best Value” college in the nation. This is the second year in a row that City College—as well as several other CUNY institutions—were cited by these rankings for the singular quality, affordability and diversity they offer students.</td>

      <td>The Italian luxury brand, helmed by creative director Daniel Lee, debarked to Michigan of all places to show its spring collection</td>
      <td>Overheard on a plane from New York to Detroit this Thursday: “Are you going to the Bottega Veneta show?” asked one black-clad editor. “No, I just really like cars,” wisecracked a similarly somber-looking retailer. It seemed unlikely that any impetus other than Bottega’s impending event would lead hundreds of fashion-industry folks—some of whom the Italian luxury fashion brand flew in by chartered jet—to congregate in Motor City. Although it’s not a typical stop on the fashion-week circuit, Detroit was once called the “Paris of the Midwest,” a name that dates back to a 1705 letter that Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, a French trader and colonist, sent his boss, heralding the city’s Parisian potential. (Monsieur Cadillac’s suit of arms, which was not wholly authentic, was eventually loosely translated into the Cadillac automobile logo.)<br />The excitement around the Bottega Veneta show in Detroit this week was a testament to the heat generated by the brand’s British designer Daniel Lee, the elfin Céline alum who’s turned the once-quiet Italian label into a star for luxury conglomerate Kering. A lover of techno and cars, Mr. Lee said he was “obsessed” with Detroit since he first visited six years ago, and eager to highlight it. Born almost 20 years after Bottega Veneta was founded in 1966, Mr. Lee has made it a shiny destination for conceptual ready-to-wear and Instagrammy accessories, especially ones in the new house shade of glaring green— “parakeet,” as it’s called.</td>

      <td>Neither martyr nor cynic: A biographer searches for the man beyond the myth.</td>
      <td>In Nancy Mitford’s “The Pursuit of Love,” the young narrator, Fanny—this is circa World War I—asks her Aunt Sadie what mysterious crime Oscar Wilde had committed. Sadie, greatly flustered, admits that she never actually knew, but that whatever it was, it was dreadfully bad, worse than murder.<br />O tempora! O mores! A century later, and Wilde has risen to the rank of secular saint, a queer martyr. In the 1997 biofilm “Wilde,” Stephen Fry played the role on a single note of dignified forbearance, showing the disgraced author enduring the humiliations and rigors of his prison and post-prison years with high-minded stoicism. No doubt the real Oscar Wilde was dignified some of the time, and certainly he deflected pain with graceful humor on many occasions, but that was not his characteristic pose: Just as often, he wept, drank and wallowed in self-pity. And as Matthew Sturgis demonstrates in his exhaustively researched, enlightening and lively new biography of Wilde—a “definitive” biography if there ever was one—Wilde behaved with consistent recklessness and self-indulgence. The fact that many of his sexual conquests were underage ought at least to raise some eyebrows in today’s world, and surely would do so if Wilde had been heterosexual, but such behavior does not seem to have dulled the moral sheen that has been accorded him in our modern tendency to “celebrate” queer lives.</td>

      <td>After ‘The Second Sex,’ de Beauvoir turned to fiction to articulate the wellsprings of her thought—and enshrine the memory of an early love.</td>
      <td>Simone de Beauvoir, born in 1908 in Paris, was the older of two daughters of a strict Catholic couple, and as a child dreamed of becoming a nun. Instead, she lost her faith when she was 14 and by her early 40s had become Mother Superior of the new belief called existentialism, a humanist response to the devastation of World War II. In fact, there was little “new” about it, except in France. There its theorists—Jean-Paul Sartre, Beauvoir and Maurice Merleau-Ponty—freely pillaged German philosophy from Hegel to Martin Heidegger and Edmund Husserl and called it their own. Unlike his fellow-philosophers, Sartre’s real gift was that of a publicist. His slick formula for existentialism—“Existence precedes essence”—popularized a dynamic for all human action, in which “contingency,” or chance, rolled the dice.<br />Beauvoir’s passionate life began early, and chance was on her side. Her father’s financial losses after World War I forced the family into poverty and crammed them together into small, smelly quarters. But the parents’ compensation was social status, and so the girls were admitted to a fashionable convent school, the Cours Adeline Désir. It was here, on her first day of class, that Simone, at age 9, fell in love.</td>

      <td>Many of history’s most nightmarish episodes are rooted in humanity’s propensity for hatred of ‘The Other.’ But the root cause remains mysterious.</td>
      <td>George Makari’s concern with xenophobia goes back to a childhood trauma. In 1974, at the age of 13, he was taken on a family visit to his parents’ native Beirut. Suddenly, the travelers found themselves caught in the midst of what would become a civil war. “To me, it was bizarre,” Dr. Makari recalls in “Of Fear and Strangers: A History of Xenophobia.” He continues: “All these bewildering sects were far more alike than different. All were Levantines who spoke the same dialect; all loved the same punning humor, devoured the same cuisine, abided by strict rules of hospitality, and approached any purchase as a three-act play: bargain, stage a walk-out, then settle. They were quick with proverbs and went agog when Fairuz sang. And yet, subtle distinctions in their identities now meant life or death.”<br />Today, Dr. Makari, a psychiatrist, psychoanalyst and the director of Weill Cornell’s DeWitt Wallace Institute of Psychiatry, sees xenophobia as a threat to social peace, not only in the Middle East but also in Europe and North America, where recent political convulsions have been driven by a bristling hostility toward strangers and outsiders. Dr. Makari is clear that a lot of different impulses are often conflated here: “ethnocentrism, ultranationalism, racism, misogyny, sexism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, transphobia, or Islamophobia.” What might they have in common? “Is there any one term specific enough to not be meaningless, while broad enough to allow us to consider whatever common strands exist between these phenomena?” He thinks that there is: xenophobia. And if all these disorders are variants of the same affliction, then perhaps they have the same cause and might be susceptible to the same treatment.</td>

      <td>Elon Musk, eat your heart out.<br />When the Securities and Exchange Commission rapped the  Tesla  chief’s knuckles with a $20 million fine each for him and his company for his infamous August 2018 tweet falsely claiming Tesla might be taken private at $420 a share, he said it was worth it. Mr. Musk later reupped the marijuana gag with a more prurient one, selling satin short shorts for $69.420 on Tesla’s website.</td>

As staff secretary, Ms. Tanden will be tasked with managing the decision-making process inside the White House, organizing meetings on policy issues and overseeing the approval of key documents like executive orders.</td>

      <td>The heroine of ‘My Name Is Lucy Barton’ returns in a story of trauma and compassion.</td>
      <td>So central and inalienable is the role of trauma in the present-day understanding of personhood that fiction on the subject often seems flatfooted. No longer is it sufficient for a novel simply to reveal a character’s traumatic past, since the past is now presumed to be a place of emotional and physical damage; nor is it enough merely to chart a character’s recovery, since “recovering” and “living” are virtually synonymous in usage. Today a deeper engagement is required. Hanya Yanagihara’s “A Little Life” caused shock waves by pushing child-abuse narratives to their logical—or perhaps absurdist—end point. And in a quieter but no less comprehensive fashion, Elizabeth’s Strout’s Lucy Barton novels, of which “Oh William!” is the latest, have become essential to the contemporary canon by taking a wider view on the interpersonal responsibilities—between family and friends, but also between strangers—shared among a society bound by its traumas.<br />“My Name Is Lucy Barton” (2016) introduced the preternaturally sensitive narrator who grew up amid poverty and abuse in rural Illinois and went on to write successful books about her childhood and life in its shadow. The mysteries of memory and perspective come to the fore in the linked stories in “Anything Is Possible” (2017), involving the people Lucy left behind in her hometown, who have decidedly mixed feelings about her interpretation of the past. Lucy narrates again in “Oh William!,” and while her own grief and fears are carefully considered, the novel’s focus is on the psychological crisis that assails her aging and lonely ex-husband.</td>

      <td>Saadat Hasan Manto’s stories explored lives at the bottom of the social ladder, with a searing honesty that got him into trouble with censors.</td>
      <td>‘Every situation has its own music,” the narrator tells us in Saadat Hasan Manto’s story “Mummy.” During his brief life—he died in 1955, from the effects of chronic alcoholism, at age 42—Manto found the right notes for a huge variety of human dramas. The Urdu-language author published more than 20 collections of short stories. He also wrote screenplays for the Bombay film industry, radio plays and a ceaseless flow of journalism. Frequently peopled by pimps, prostitutes, hoodlums, gamblers and hard-drinking bohemians (like their creator), his fictional dispatches from the seamy side of midcentury South Asian societies saw him prosecuted for obscenity six times: three cases under the Raj in British India, three in newly independent Pakistan. Anti-Muslim rioting in Bombay, the city he loved and chronicled, prompted his family to move north to Lahore after the Partition of India in 1947.<br />An endlessly fertile storyteller, Manto charmed even his accusers. He once befriended the Pakistani judge who had just fined him for a scandalous tale. “Society itself is obscene,” he told the judge. “All I do is represent its essence. It is entirely understandable that people with ugly faces vent their anger at the mirror.”</td>
