New research this week suggests that the bill could drive more than one million workers from the labor force.<br />Democrats are offering a $3,600 allowance for children under age six and $3,000 for ages six through 17, extending through 2025 provisions passed earlier this year in a Covid relief bill. The allowance, previously $2,000, is “fully refundable” in 2021 to those who pay no income tax.

The rule would require banks to report annual deposit and spending totals for ordinary account holders. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has championed the change, telling CNBC on Tuesday that it “would really help the IRS target their auditing resources.”</td>

      <td>Judge grants preliminary injunction supporting Justice Department effort to upend near-ban on procedure</td>
      <td>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction blocking a Texas law that imposes a near-ban on abortion. Since the law went into effect on Sept. 1, it has largely shut down abortion in the state by prohibiting the procedure after about the sixth week of pregnancy. The Supreme Court had earlier declined to block the Texas Heartbeat Act, or SB 8, from taking effect, rejecting by a 5-4 vote an emergency request from abortion clinics. Since then, the Justice Department filed its own lawsuit. Here’s what you should know about the status of the law.<br />There were legal proceedings ahead of SB 8’s Sept. 1 effective date, with abortion clinics seeking to block the six-week ban before it took hold. The Supreme Court’s order late that evening allowed the Texas law to take effect but didn’t address its merits or whether future lawsuits could succeed in obtaining judicial review of the ban. Instead, the unsigned majority opinion, one paragraph long, only said the court couldn’t intervene because of procedural uncertainties over the proper defendant in the clinics’ lawsuit.</td>

      <td>The story of the operation to save a Thai soccer team gets the documentary treatment in Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin’s gripping film</td>
      <td>Claustrophobes beware, but even you may find “The Rescue” enthralling. It’s a National Geographic documentary, playing in theaters, about the international effort, organized at a feverish pace in June 2018, to rescue 12 boys and their soccer coach trapped in a flooded cave in northern Thailand. The directors were Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin. They won an Oscar in 2019 for “Free Solo,” a literal cliff-hanger of a doc about a climber ascending the sheer wall of El Capitan, the 3,200-foot monolith in Yosemite National Park, without the usual array of climbing equipment or safety gear. Their latest film chronicles the skill and unfathomable courage of divers who descended into the darkness of a labyrinthine system of caves, risking entrapment in the tightest of spaces by rapidly rising water. The stuff of heroism is always mysterious. In this case it’s also marvelously strange.<br />Chances are you recall the end of the story, which spanned more than two weeks and, during most of that time, figured prominently in news coverage around the world. Even so, the suspense will be almost unendurable. I wrote that about “Free Solo” and it’s no less true here, because the fate of the teenage athletes and their coach is tied to the safety of the divers. Every dive is fraught with peril, every constricted chamber in the vast subterranean maze could turn out to be a death trap. (Although a movie about confined spaces might seem a logical candidate for viewing on home screens—and though some of the diving scenes are, of necessity, re-enactments—try to see “The Rescue” in a theater before it goes to streaming. Only the big screen can do justice to the remarkable scale and complexity of the endeavor, which involved almost 5,000 Thais and more than 10,000 people altogether.)</td>

      <td>CNN’s six-part series on Diana, Princess of Wales, didn’t learn any lessons from the media maelstrom that surrounded her life and death.</td>
      <td>By rights, Americans ought to be looking at the six-part “Diana” with a cocked brow and a jaundiced eye. The celebrated Princess of Wales, who was killed in 1997 under genuinely tragic circumstances, would have turned 60 in July and remains an object of fascination nearly 25 years after her death. And yet the root cause of all the pain, scandal, anguish and royal adulteries revisited by this CNN series is precisely that monarchical system we shrugged off 238 years ago. If one takes a step back from the emotionally obvious, it’s difficult to regard the story with seriousness, or at least the seriousness with which the documentary regards itself.<br />Celebrity culture is celebrity culture, however, and Diana is Diana. What would have been nice is some perspective.</td>

      <td>An Icelandic drama follows isolated farmers who’ve lost a child but receive an ovine surrogate.</td>
      <td>Let’s start with one of the countless details, tiny and large, that make “Lamb” a tale of hypnotic beauty—and one with a wild and woolly premise that could have gone howlingly wrong. It’s what we see immediately after the Icelandic heroine, María, sits down to calm herself by playing the piano. (She’s played powerfully in her turn by Noomi Rapace.) As the first notes are heard, the camera peers inside the instrument at the hammers hitting the strings to make the music. What’s that all about? Well, the hammers are made of felt, which comes from wool, which comes from sheep.<br />“Lamb,” playing in theaters with English subtitles, is sheepcentric, not to mention eccentric, and the quirky shot contributes to the tone of the film, a debut feature by Valdimar Jóhannsson that is delicately droll as well as frightening, fearlessly silly and weirdly profound. (Eli Arenson did the elegantly austere cinematography. Þórarinn Guðnason wrote the music. Björn Viktorsson created the haunting sound design.)</td>

Epatha Merkerson and directed by George C. Wolfe, has now been given a Broadway production. In all its iterations, it is an autobiographical play by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, a first-class director and actor best known for his remarkable off-Broadway revivals of August Wilson’s “The Piano Lesson” and “Seven Guitars.” In it, Mr. Santiago-Hudson tells of how he grew up in a rooming house for “ramblers and drifters” run by “Nanny” Rachel Crosby, the tough but caring woman who raised him (his own mother was a drug addict) and who was, in his admiring words, “like the government if it really worked.” In the stage version, he plays, in addition to himself and Nanny, 23 other characters with names like Numb Finger Pete and Sweet Tooth Sam. The only person who actually shares the stage with him, though, is Junior Mack, a guitarist who plays a blues-drenched score by Bill Sims Jr. (Mr. Santiago-Hudson does his own harmonica playing, which is of professional quality).</td>

      <td>With the stroke of a pen, the Food and Drug Administration could save thousands of Covid patients’ lives. Data released last week showed that the new antiviral pill molnupiravir, made by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, is safe and reduces the risk of the direst outcomes (hospitalization or death) by 50%. It works by directly blocking replication of the virus, is effective against variants, and can be used in combination with other Covid therapies.<br />The FDA’s emergency-use authorization (EUA) can take months. But the FDA could allow compassionate use of molnupiravir now by activating what is known as an expanded-access protocol, ahead of the drug’s formal evaluation. There is a precedent. Last year, the FDA activated the protocol for convalescent plasma months before it issued a formal EUA. The agency also allowed monoclonal antibodies to be given to President Trump and other officials last year before that therapy was granted a formal EUA.</td>

That might not be enough to take the edge off of prices, though.<br />The association said in its presentation on Thursday that winter will be 1% colder than last year and roughly in line with the past three winters. If the season pans out the way NGSA expects, the U.S. will end up with 1.7 trillion cubic feet of gas in underground storage by the end of March, 6.3% below the five-year average but enough to quell any fears about an actual physical shortage of the commodity. If temperatures turn out to be similar to the cold winter of 2013-2014, however, the NGSA forecasts that storage will start approaching a trillion cubic feet in March, a level that could cause prices to spike.</td>

But the lack of expertise in the economic incentives that limit disease is much broader, as Richard Posner and I argued three decades ago. Since then, the field of economic epidemiology has exploded, and Covid-19 represents many déjà vu experiences of its main lessons.<br />First, the course of communicable diseases is driven more by incentives in the private sector than by government policy. The incentive for prevention rises with disease occurrence. This implies a self-limiting effect on disease growth—contrary to public-health predictions—but also exponential growth early on in the outbreak. Thus, testing in early 2020 was not as central as claimed by many, including by Drs. Deborah Birx and Scott Gottlieb. A great testing program would still battle low prevention incentives, including demand for tests.</td>

He should never permit his own crude opinions as to their fitness, to influence his attention to them.” The legal introduction of informed consent in the International Code of Medical Ethics, which the World Medical Association adopted in Helsinki in 1949, required that people are told what is about to happen to them, and given choice in the matter. In 1982, a presidential commission appointed by Ronald Reagan stated that beyond its foundation in law, informed consent “is essentially an ethical imperative.”</td>

After serving in the U.S. Marines in the early 1960s, however, Mr. Miller returned to Manny Hanny and slotted himself into a management-training program. At the age of 29, he was promoted to overhaul the company’s unprofitable credit-card business. Success there led to a series of further promotions.</td>

What employers should really care about, however, is an employee’s alertness level while performing the job. This holds true all the more so for employees in safety-sensitive jobs such as tower repair, where a lack of alertness could result in death.<br />Marijuana use is only one of many factors affecting employee alertness. Others are poor sleep, anxiety and changes in prescribed medications, to name a few. I think employers will be better served by exploring ways to assess an employee’s alertness regardless of the cause. If employees aren’t as mentally alert as they normally are, employers should help them address it before they get behind the wheel or fire up that chainsaw.</td>

Bernie Sanders’ $5.5 trillion welfare state expansion is signed into law. (The usual estimate of $3.5 trillion assumes its programs will be allowed to expire, which they won’t.)<br />Mr. Biden’s capitulation was utterly unnecessary.

Xi Jinping may manage to prevent the burst of the real estate bubble, but China’s economy isn’t heading for more-sustainable growth. Evergrande’s woes are a reminder that China’s political economy under Mr. Xi has become even more unstable, even as Beijing grows more impatient to displace America as the dominant power. Time is not on China’s side.<br />The global financial crisis that began with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 led to a severe liquidity crunch as financial institutions lost faith in the capacity of one another and commercial firms to repay their loans. China’s financial system doesn’t work this way. Loss of faith in the commercial worthiness of other entities isn’t fatal. Instead, banks and other financial institutions unfailingly lend if instructed to do so by political masters.</td>

In November 1688, a largely Dutch army of 24,000 landed at Torbay in Devonshire, and within a few months its commander—William, Prince of Orange—was king of England. Some might say that this was not really an invasion: first because William had come at the invitation of opposition politicians who had urged him to depose James II and restore “the liberties of England”; and second because there was no battle, most of James’s generals having crossed over to William. There were, however, battles in Scotland and Ireland. The so-called Glorious Revolution was also termed a “bloodless” one, but only in England and not throughout the British Isles.<br />William would reign from 1689 to 1702, jointly with his wife, Mary (James’s daughter), until her death in 1694 and then on his own. He is the hero of Macaulay’s “History of England,” for having led the country (as Macaulay saw it) away from James’s despotism and toward a securely parliamentary monarchy. Yet William is little remembered in England today, despite a fine equestrian statue of him in St. James’s Square.</td>

      <td>U.S. space agency reassigns two astronauts from Boeing missions to a future SpaceX flight</td>
      <td>Boeing Co. ’s Starliner space vehicle won’t get to attempt launch again this year, NASA officials said Wednesday, and two astronauts who were meant to fly on it were reassigned to a future mission using a SpaceX ship.<br />Boeing and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration had planned to fly the Starliner, without crew on board, to the International Space Station this past summer. The vehicle, launched into space on a rocket from which it separates, must complete such a test flight before it can try to ferry astronauts to the facility. Boeing and the space agency in August postponed a test mission because some valves on the Starliner’s propulsion system became stuck before launch.</td>
