Japanese forces can exercise with Australia in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific.</td>

The referendum also stipulated that if Portland were under an emergency proclamation, a hazard-pay multiplier would take affect that’s 1.5 times the minimum wage.

He kept talking about it even after his department had failed to corroborate it, and even though the CIA viewed it as mere “Internet rumor.”</td>

      <td>As in the early 1980s, new realities test the idea that interest rates reflect ‘rational expectations.’</td>
      <td>The interest rate on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note hovers around 1.75% while the annual rate of inflation nears 7%, suggesting that investors believe high inflation is temporary. Evidently the market expects the Federal Reserve will soon bring inflation back to within a narrow band centered on 2% a year, despite the surge in federal deficits and the central bank’s monetization of a large fraction of those deficits. Today’s low interest rates “forecast” low inflation, a “rational expectations” idea that now comforts the Fed. But the central bank shouldn’t feel too complacent.<br />The Fed confronted a similar situation in the early 1980s, but in reverse. Chairman Paul Volcker convinced his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee to raise short-term interest rates to extinguish double-digit U.S. inflation and the associated double-digit long-term interest rates. Volcker and the FOMC had promised in public that measures to tighten money and credit weren’t one-time actions but part of a permanent strategy to arrest inflation. They reasoned that once the market understood the FOMC meant business, long-term interest rates would quickly fall to reflect the prospective decline in inflation implied by the FOMC’s strategy. They were in for a nasty surprise.</td>

      <td>Duke researchers look at transmission in schools and end up reinforcing their prior assumptions.</td>
      <td>‘Follow the science,” we keep hearing, but sometimes scientists and the media present findings in a misleading way. Consider a new study by Duke University’s ABC Science Collaborative, conducted in partnership with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. Researchers examined the effect of a “test to stay” approach to schoolchildren identified as “close contacts” of Covid-positive people. Test to stay excuses these children from quarantining if they test negative for the virus. The study’s primary conclusion was that test to stay is a good way to move away from lengthy quarantine.<br />That’s reasonable and useful. But the researchers peppered their report with rhetorical sleights of hand aimed at misleading readers into other, less well-founded conclusions that were mostly inevitable products of their own study design. One of their primary conclusions is that “in schools with universal masking, test-to-stay is an effective strategy.” That invites readers to assume that test-to-stay doesn’t work without forced masking. But since they studied no unmasked schools, this conclusion is baseless. An honest report would either have said so or not mentioned masking at all.</td>

Its stars still burn brightly—perhaps especially so in our own gruesomely unheroic times—with Ernest Shackleton considered by many to be the brightest star of them all. Admired for his courage, leadership and grace under pressure, he was called The Boss by his colleagues. In lower latitudes, he drank and dallied and made mistakes like the rest of us: That, of course, is why we love him. This year marks the centenary of his death.<br />Ranulph Fiennes is arguably the world’s greatest living extreme adventurer. His many expeditions include the 1979 Trans Globe, during which his team became the first to circumnavigate the planet via both poles. Drawing on his own experience, Mr. Fiennes offers a rare perspective in “Shackleton: The Biography.” As he reminds us, “no previous Shackleton biographer has man-hauled a heavy sledge load through the great crevasse fields of the Beardmore Glacier, explored undiscovered icefields or walked a thousand miles on poisoned feet, hundreds of miles away from civilization.”</td>

      <td>The past president can’t be blamed for this one’s problem.</td>
      <td>In “Joe Biden’s Inflationary Trade Policy” (op-ed, Jan. 5), William Walker and Stanton Anderson attempt to blame President Trump’s tariffs as the “real culprit” for President Biden’s inflation. Yet there was virtually no inflation for nearly three years after the Trump tariffs on steel and Chinese goods first went into effect in 2018. What changed in 2021 was massive new government spending and a disastrous new energy policy. That toxic combination—along with excessively easy monetary policy and loads of new regulation—is what caused inflation, not tariffs.<br />Tariff revenue may reach $100 billion this year, up threefold from 2016. That’s important, but it’s a rounding error in the context of a nearly $21 trillion economy. The Progressive Policy Institute recently estimated based on studies published in 2019 that the tariffs on Chinese goods at most have added 0.1 to 0.4 percentage points to an inflation rate that was near 7% in November. I suspect even that low estimate is too high, given steps companies have taken to restructure supply chains and avoid tariffs. But even if it is anywhere near accurate, that’s a small price to pay to lessen our dependence on China and protect U.S. jobs.</td>

For us, it was a strategic goal, but for the people of the Solomons who helped us fight, it was an existential threat. China sent no contingent to the prolonged fight.<br />Our side fought with old weapons, planes and ships against state-of-the-art Japanese equivalents. The fast, heavily armored and powerful U.S. carriers and battleships, as well as superior fighters and dive bombers, didn’t come out until after the Solomons campaign. All we had were good pilots and naval commanders, adequate equipment, good intelligence and radar. Yet by the end of the campaign, the cream of Japanese naval aviation was dead and the people of the Solomons were free of the Japanese.</td>

There can be no soft-pedaling what happened and no absolution for those who planned, encouraged and aided the attempt to overthrow our democracy. Love of country demands nothing less. That’s true patriotism” (“Republicans’ Jan. 6 Responsibility,” op-ed, Jan. 6).</td>

      <td>After a car accident, two strangers’ lives become intertwined in this Josh Gad and Isla Fisher comedy with some seriously wild twists.</td>
      <td>Reviewers are often asked to avoid spoilers, aka plot points, plot twists and anything that might remotely disturb the experience of whatever masterwork is under consideration. Sometimes, the admonishments are at the level of “Don’t tell ’em the boat sinks” in “Titanic.” But with “Wolf Like Me,” the impulse is to forge ahead and not reveal anything. The six-episode series is so charming, disarming and odd it’s almost a work of magic. And, as with any magic trick, the delight depends on not knowing how it’s going to work.<br />At the same time, what will viewers possibly think they’re in for with a show titled “Wolf Like Me”? It’s hard to imagine (especially with the echo of “Black Like Me”), but the sleight of hand begins with a literal bang: one car T-boning the other at an intersection in Adelaide, Australia, onlookers gasping amid a shower of glass and a shriek of metal. The drivers—Gary (Josh Gad) and Mary (Isla Fisher)—are miraculously unhurt, as is Gary’s 11-year-old passenger, his daughter, Emma (the wonderful Ariel Donoghue), whom we have already learned is prone to panic attacks and depression after the death of her mother. Flipping through the air several times after a potentially lethal collision hardly seems like the treatment she needs.</td>

Consider the movie an act of appeasement.<br />Consider it, also, something almost exclusively for the existing “Ray” fan, the viewer already familiar with the series created by writer and producer Ann Biderman (“Southland”) and starring Liev Schreiber as Donovan, a Hollywood fixer who went about getting his celebrity clients out of various degrees of trouble. And who wasn’t averse to cracking heads to do so. As “The Movie” relates—no spoilers will be forthcoming—it all began in Boston, where the story takes place. As befitting its tone of seriousness and self-regard, it has an ending that’s close to Shakespearean.</td>

That worked well when Hong Kong enjoyed a monthslong streak of no locally transmitted cases. Now, with 42 community infections detected in the past two weeks as the Omicron variant spreads across the city, officials are running out of capacity and some experts are questioning if the policy of zero infections is sustainable.</td>

A diminishing number of allowances are granted with the rest being auctioned off. Initially market prices languished, but have been rising since a 2018 reform.

That would be a man-made disaster.<br />To minimize that risk, policy makers must tolerate the rapid spread of milder variants. This will require difficult trade-offs, but it will save lives in the long run. We should end mask mandates and social distancing in most settings not because they don’t slow the spread—the usual argument against such measures—but because they probably do.</td>

Second, the administration’s attempts to make a priority of human rights and democracy have so far failed to reverse or even to slow the retreat of democracy around the world.<br />The Biden administration’s political fragility at home is partly to blame. But adversaries are watching more than American domestic politics; they see incoherence in American policy. The administration has signaled that balancing China in the Indo-Pacific, the promotion of democracy and climate policy are its overriding foreign-policy priorities. Our adversaries—and some of our friends—think that these goals can’t be pursued successfully at the same time. They conclude that American policy focused on incompatible objectives will ultimately fail.</td>

After 20 years, almost 2,500 servicemen and -women killed, and $2.3 trillion spent, Afghanistan is once again under the control of the Taliban. America’s invasion of Iraq distracted the U.S. from more pressing threats and paved the way for a bolstered Iran and radical Sunni groups like ISIS. And yet, despite the obvious failures, there hasn’t been another terrorist attack on a similarly large scale. Why is that? Our security apparatus has clearly done something right.<br />Perhaps the most spectacular success in preventing another attack was a joint operation, in the mid-2000s, against a plot to down seven airliners as they traveled from London’s Heathrow Airport to destinations in the U.S. and Canada. The race to thwart the attack is well documented in “Disruption” by Aki J. Peritz, a former CIA analyst. The Overt plot, as it was known to security officials, was planned by an al Qaeda cell operating in the Walthamstow neighborhood of London and the town of High Wycombe outside the city. For those tasked with keeping the homelands safe on both sides of the Atlantic, it was either a near miss or a great triumph, depending on how one chooses to look at it.</td>
