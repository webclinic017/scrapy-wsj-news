      <td>There is no evidence so far that vaccines are reducing infections from the fast-spreading variant.</td>
      <td>Federal courts considering the Biden administration’s vaccination mandates—including the Supreme Court at Friday’s oral argument—have focused on administrative-law issues. The decrees raise constitutional issues as well. But there’s a simpler reason the justices should stay these mandates: the rise of the Omicron variant.<br />It would be irrational, legally indefensible and contrary to the public interest for government to mandate vaccines absent any evidence that the vaccines are effective in stopping the spread of the pathogen they target. Yet that’s exactly what’s happening here.</td>

      <td>He cries ‘gouging’ as they face higher costs for labor, fuel and feed.</td>
      <td>President Biden has found a scapegoat for rising inflation: the meat industry. Mr. Biden claimed last week that meatpackers—who handle the processing, packaging and distribution of meat raised by farmers and ranchers—are price-gouging, driving a surge in consumer prices for beef, chicken and pork. As they say in cowboy country, Mr. Biden’s claim is all hat and no cattle. Unable or unwilling to acknowledge the problems actually driving inflation, Mr. Biden is proposing solutions based on the same failed policies that got us into this inflationary mess in the first place.<br />Meat prices are surging because the meat industry, like virtually every other industry, is facing dramatically higher input and labor costs. This isn’t a secret. Start with feed costs, which are at historic highs. As the Journal reported on Dec. 27, feed costs skyrocketed in 2021 and are expected to be volatile this year. This makes it more expensive to raise livestock, which in turn creates higher costs for meat.</td>

I have not been directly affected by any of this marauding, but hearing about it on television and radio news, receiving online flashes about it on my cellphone and stories from friends, I find myself affected by it, as I suspect most people are.<br />The other night at 7, I left to pick up dinner at a restaurant less than 100 yards from our apartment building. I walked warily on the deserted street over to the restaurant, and when I returned, using my fob to get back into our building, I heard myself exhale a sigh of relief.

The term was first used, we are told, in a national newspaper in October 1943. Such letters have since become a symbol of the female treachery that can damage a man as deeply as the wartime loss of life or limb.</td>

His troop deployments near Ukraine’s border were failing, and new popular uprisings could topple autocrats in other former Soviet republics, complicating the Russian president’s strategic calculations.<br />The unspoken corollary to this theorizing is that the last thing America or Europe should do is take provocative action regarding Ukraine or other countries caught in the gray zone between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s eastern borders and Russia’s western ones. Kazakhstan is a Kremlin problem where “America has no real leverage,” as Politico put this instant conventional wisdom. Predictably, the State Department’s first reaction to the Kazakh crisis was moral equivalency, calling “for restraint by both the authorities and protestors.”</td>

      <td>Europe’s unemployment rate has fallen below its pre-pandemic level, but a surge in wages this year doesn’t seem likely even though higher inflation has weakened workers’ spending power, according to economists and officials.<br />At 7.3%, the eurozone’s unemployment rate was below pre-pandemic levels in October, having hit a pandemic high of 8.6% in September 2020. The relatively small size of those swings, economists say, is largely because of furlough programs, in which governments essentially paid businesses to keep idled workers on as employees during the pandemic, rather than letting them go, by covering a large share of their wages.</td>

France, Germany, Italy and many other EU countries are pressuring unvaccinated adults to get inoculated by excluding them from more everyday activities, while stopping short of a universal vaccine mandate. European arm-twisting contrasts with more laissez-faire approaches in the U.K. and U.S., but doesn’t satisfy public-health experts who say it would be more effective to make vaccination mandatory.</td>

As economies around the world started to reopen, energy demand surged, fueling a rebound by energy stocks.<br />Those same stocks could be poised to perform well this year, as energy demand remains elevated. Limited oil and gas supply is also likely to keep prices high. A recent research note from UBS suggested that oil could stay above $80 a barrel in 2022; it’s around $80 now.</td>

For people like me, the pandemic has been particularly difficult. It has made it impossible to engage with friends over drinks or dinner, or to chat with colleagues over lunch or coffee.</td>

Watteau’s largest artwork at 10 feet across, “Gersaint’s Shopsign” is an understated masterwork.

Two decades ago, no one had to sell the idea that America had suffered a devastating attack.
