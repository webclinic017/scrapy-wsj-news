      <td>Australian installment-payment company positions its service as a cheaper, more responsible alternative to a credit card</td>
      <td>SYDNEY— Square Inc.  has agreed to an all-stock deal valued at around $29 billion to acquire Australia’s  Afterpay Ltd. , an installment-payment company that positions its service as a cheaper and more responsible alternative to a credit card.<br />Square said it plans to integrate Afterpay into its Seller and Cash App business units, which would allow more retailers to offer so-called buy now, pay later services at checkout.<br />Afterpay’s technology allows users to pay for goods in four interest-free installments, while receiving the goods immediately. Customers pay a fee only if they miss an automated payment, a transgression that also locks their account until the balance is repaid. Afterpay says this limits bad debts, particularly in a downturn when job security is shaky and household finances are stretched.<br />Most of Afterpay’s revenue comes from retail merchants, which pay a percentage of the value of each order placed by customers, plus a fixed fee. The company is expanding across the U.S. through deals with retailers including Anthropologie and Free People.<br />“Square and Afterpay have a shared purpose,” said Jack Dorsey, Square’s chief executive. “We built our business to make the financial system more fair, accessible, and inclusive, and Afterpay has built a trusted brand aligned with those principles.”</td>

      <td>Gavin Newsom is paying for the policy failures of Sacramento.</td>
      <td>California Gov. Gavin Newsom won election in 2018 by 24 points amid an anti-Trump wave. Democrats control every statewide office and a supermajority in the Legislature. But voter frustration with progressive misrule is mounting, and a new poll finds that Mr. Newsom is vulnerable in a Sept. 14 recall election.<br />The Berkeley IGS poll shows 47% of likely voters supporting his ouster. Under California recall rules, voters are first asked whether to remove an elected official. Then they vote separately on a replacement. If a majority votes to boot Mr. Newsom, the candidate with the most votes on the second question becomes Governor.<br />It’s hard to predict the recall turnout given its timing and because it will be conducted by mail-in ballots. The latter should help Mr. Newsom since support for his recall is less (36%) among all registered voters. But it’s not a good sign that his approval rating among all registered voters has fallen 14 points since last September to 50%.<br />Mr. Newsom is notably suffering from a lack of enthusiasm among key groups. Forty-seven percent of likely voters ages 18 and 39 support his removal, as do half of 40- to 64-year-olds and Asians. Likely voters in every region of the state but San Francisco, Los Angeles and the Central Coast want him out.<br />The recall is in part a referendum on the Governor’s excessive and destructive Covid lockdowns. California boasts the third highest unemployment rate in the country (7.7%). Last fall he was caught violating his own Covid rules with friends at the ritzy French Laundry restaurant in Napa Valley. Weeks later he shut down businesses, including outdoor dining.</td>

      <td>Democrats want an emergency measure to last forever.</td>
      <td>Perhaps you’ve read that the pandemic recession officially ended in April 2020, that the economy grew 6.5% in the second quarter, that employers are desperate to find workers, and that the housing market is booming. Never mind. Democrats are in a panic because the federal ban on landlords evicting tenants who haven’t paid rent in 16 months expired on Saturday.<br />The eviction moratorium was perhaps justifiable amid the early lockdowns that threw millions out of work, but it’s now a cautionary tale of how bad policies distort behavior and are difficult to end. The original Cares Act moratorium that only applied to federally subsidized housing expired last July, but the Trump Centers for Disease Control and Prevention imposed its version in September. The moratorium applied to all rental housing and tenants who earned less than $99,000 ($198,000 for couples) who claimed they lost income because of the pandemic. Landlords who evicted non-paying tenants could go to jail.<br />Congress extended the ban in December for a month, but then the Biden Administration extended it three times through Saturday despite rulings from several judges that the CDC had exceeded its authority. Last month Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined the liberals in maintaining a stay on a lower-court injunction reversing the ban.<br />Justice Kavanaugh wrote that he agreed the CDC acted unlawfully but allowed the moratorium to continue so rental assistance appropriated by Congress could have more time to be distributed. But he said a “clear and specific congressional authorization (via new legislation) would be necessary for the CDC to extend the moratorium past July 31.”<br />Cue the political panic. On Thursday, two days before July 31, the White House issued a statement essentially blaming the Supreme Court for the moratorium’s end and urged Congress to extend it. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declared a five-alarm fire, but her attempt to rush an extension through the House failed. Too many Democrats balked.</td>

      <td>How many Iranian slaps in the face will it take for President Biden to accept that he can’t change Tehran’s malign behavior by returning to the 2015 nuclear deal?<br />The latest provocation was an attack Thursday night in the Arabian Sea on a commercial oil tanker that killed two crew members. The tanker Mercer Street is managed by a London-based company owned by an Israeli billionaire. Israel fingered Iran for the attack, and Iran denied it. On Sunday the U.S. and U.K. joined Israel in holding Iran responsible.<br />“Upon review of the available information, we are confident that Iran conducted this attack, which killed two innocent people, using one-way explosive UAVs, a lethal capability it is increasingly employing throughout the region,” said Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a statement. He said the U.S. is coordinating with allies on a response.<br />Here’s an idea: Stop negotiating with Iran on a nuclear deal that would reward the regime by lifting sanctions and handing it cash and investment to finance new UAV and other attacks throughout the region and beyond.<br />In recent weeks Iran has plotted to kill an Iranian-born U.S. citizen in New York City, encouraged its proxies to attack U.S. bases in Iraq, and accelerated its violations of the 2015 nuclear accord. A new hardline President is taking power in Tehran and has said a renewed deal can contain no limits on Iran’s regional behavior. Instead of making more concessions, Mr. Biden should walk away and step up the sanctions.</td>

Yet Majority Leader Chuck Schumer plans to jam the $1 trillion legislation through this week before most Americans will even know what’s in it.<br />“Given the thoroughly bipartisan nature of the bill, I expect we will be able to consider all the relevant amendments and finish the bill in a matter of days,” Mr. Schumer said. But being “bipartisan” is hardly reassuring. The infrastructure bill is being written by a handful of Senators, though you can be sure lobbyists are all over the details if not in the room.<br />On the outside are Americans who want to see for themselves the fine print on permitting reform, union-wage rules, how the bill is paid for, or language that favors political constituencies. Bipartisan bills often contain some of the worst special-interest excesses.<br />Mr. Schumer wants to rush the bill through so he can move on to Bernie Sanders’s $3.5 trillion budget resolution that he will then sprint through on a party-line vote. He wants to pass both before the Senate’s August recess.<br />Amendments will often be offered and voted on while the nation sleeps to meet this artificial deadline that is convenient for the political class but not for informing the public. Both parties operate this way now. But it isn’t the right way to run a democracy, and no wonder Americans hold Congress in such low regard.</td>

      <td>Though few have noticed, the central bank is already slowing the growth of the money supply.</td>
      <td>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last month told the House Banking Committee “it would be a mistake” to tighten monetary policy “at a time when virtually all forecasters” believe that inflation “will come down” on its own. His message couldn’t have been clearer: Mr. Powell isn’t in a hurry to start paring the Fed’s monthly purchases of $120 billion in Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, and the Fed plans to continue monetary easing into 2022.<br />In monetary policy, as in all else, actions speak louder than words. The Fed has expanded its reverse-repo borrowing to an unprecedented $1.26 trillion at the end of June from $272 billion in April, pulling almost a trillion dollars of liquidity out of the financial system. Reverse-repo borrowing has reduced bank reserves, even as the Fed has continued to buy Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities.<br />Not surprisingly, money supply growth is starting to moderate. The growth of the M2 money stock fell from around 25% in 2020 to around 10% on an annualized basis in the first six months of 2021. It was less than 4% in the last quarter. Remarkably in an economy awash in money, Fed action to reduce liquidity by $1 trillion in three months has thus far gone largely unnoticed, but this stealth action represents a dramatic change in monetary policy. The magnitude of the explosion in reverse-repo borrowing is roughly the equivalent of the impact of selling rather than buying $120 billion of securities to the public a month for more than eight months.<br />If all this seems confusing, remember: This isn’t your father’s Fed. The central bank has bought (or offset by buying similar-maturity mortgage-backed securities) 76.4% of all the federal debt issued during the pandemic, almost nine times the share of federal debt purchased by the Fed during World War II. The Fed now holds 33.6% of all publicly held federal debt, roughly the same percentage of the debt held by all other American investors combined. The Fed also holds 35% of all federally insured mortgage-backed securities.<br />The commercial banking system has been profoundly transformed as the Fed balance sheet has exploded. By paying interest on reserves, the Fed has made reserves an interest-bearing asset for the banking system and a liability of the Fed, allowing the Fed to borrow from banks to acquire securities without expanding the money supply. The private banking system now holds more interest-bearing reserves than it has outstanding commercial and industrial loans. Remarkably, the Fed is now borrowing more money from the private banking system than all private commercial borrowers combined.</td>

      <td>The one success of the Arab Spring may not survive its president’s apparent power grab.</td>
      <td>Is the only success story of the Arab Spring reaching an authoritarian end? The series of uprisings that took place across the Middle East failed spectacularly—except in Tunisia, where it had all begun in December 2010, when a destitute street vendor operating without a permit set himself on fire after government bureaucrats confiscated the contents of his produce stand. While its neighbors flamed out, Tunisia made a successful if uneasy transition to democracy. A decade later, the democratically elected president of Tunisia, Kais Saied, has effectively torched his nation’s democratic project.<br />On July 25 Mr. Saied invoked Article 80 of the Tunisian Constitution, which transfers near-absolute power to the president if the country is in “imminent danger.” Mr. Saied dismissed Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi, a political rival backed by Ennahda, a moderate Islamist party, the largest in Parliament. The president then announced he would appoint a new government, “freeze” all parliamentary activity for 30 days, and extend the suspension if necessary “until the situation settles down.” In the following 24 hours, Mr. Saied followed the typical authoritarian playbook: Military troops surrounded the Parliament building to block legislators from meeting; draconian measures prohibiting public assembly of more than three people were enacted; media outlets were shuttered. The president warned that the armed forces will respond to violence “with bullets.”<br />Tunisians greeted the president’s actions with jubilance, their reaction reminiscent of Egyptians who in 2013 cheered their army, led by now-President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, when it removed from power the democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood government of President Mohamed Morsi. Like their Egyptian counterparts, Tunisians will soon find out that their future bodes ill under the authoritarianism of another regional strongman.<br />While there’s a tendency to view this as a regional phenomenon—the latest twinge in a lingering Arab Spring hangover—what is happening in Tunisia is representative of a larger global phenomenon. The populists who ascended in Hungary, Turkey and India—and the U.S., in 2016—were elected not because voters craved authoritarian rule but because the leaders of the liberal democratic institutions failed to deliver competent governance.<br />Tunisians lost patience with their leaders as they watched nine successive governments in 10 years issue big promises and consistently falter. Complex power-sharing arrangements resulted only in legislative stasis and blame-ducking. Since 2011, half of the Tunisian dinar’s value has vanished; unemployment is currently at about 18% and has been as high as 32% in some regions; corruption is endemic; and the government bungled its response to the Covid pandemic.</td>

      <td>YouTube is working to balance competing interests. Government can set clear but flexible rules.</td>
      <td>When I was growing up, every time I wrote a letter to my grandfather I worried it might be censored. My father had fled communist Poland for the U.S., but my grandfather was unable to escape and still lived behind the Iron Curtain. I learned very young that it can be dangerous when governments reach too far.<br />As CEO of YouTube, I grapple every day with issues related to free expression and responsibility. Companies, civil society and governments are facing unprecedented challenges and sorting through complicated questions, determining where to draw the lines on speech in the 21st century. Policy makers around the world are introducing regulatory proposals—some argue that too much content is left up on platforms, while others say too much is taken down. At YouTube, we’re working to protect our community while enabling new and diverse voices to break through. Three principles should guide discussions about the regulation of online speech.<br />First, the open internet has transformed society in incredible ways. The Group of Seven leaders reaffirmed the fundamental value of openness in a recent statement. YouTube makes information available to anyone with an internet connection. People around the world come to YouTube to find information, to learn and to build community. But creating a space that’s open to everyone means that bad actors will sometimes cross the line.<br />YouTube has always had community guidelines that set the rules of the road. We remove content that could cause real harm, such as violent extremism, copyright infringement and dangerous pranks. Some of our decisions are controversial, but we apply our policies equally, regardless of who posts the content or the political viewpoint expressed. At the same time, we embrace the inherent complexity and messiness of the internet. Stripping away everything that’s controversial could silence important voices and ideas.<br />The second principle: Democratic governments must provide companies with clear guidelines about illegal speech. That helps us remove illegal content more quickly and efficiently. These laws must be grounded in international norms as officials balance the right to information with the risk of harm. The rules governing the internet are regularly updated, from copyright to elections and political campaigning. YouTube is willing to work with governments to address these and other issues.</td>

      <td>Callow youths, sold on the value of a sheepskin, have borrowed small fortunes to attend college. Was it worth it? Will the loans ever be repaid?</td>
      <td>Who says American ingenuity is dead? No other nation could have invented and sustained anything like our Byzantine student loan system, with its immense cost, dizzying complexity and perverse incentives.<br />Launched with the best of intentions, the system has produced a human and financial catastrophe. Many former students have reasonable debts, but millions have no realistic hope of paying what they owe, proving once again the iron law of credit—that truly massive debts end up in the lap of taxpayers. The whole mess is the subject of two valuable new books.<br />In “The Debt Trap,” Josh Mitchell offers a devastating account of the ways in which government, business, academia and naive citizens joined forces to produce the nation’s $1.6 trillion student loan crisis. The story he tells is so infuriating that it could induce apoplexy in a Zen monk. Yet it is also a characteristically American story, in which democratic ideals, political expedience, concerns over national security, naked greed and tender optimism have blighted the lives of millions.<br />Government-supported student loans go back to the 1950s, when they began in a climate of concern (not to say paranoia) about communism, against which advanced schooling, particularly of a technical nature, was considered a potent weapon. The GI Bill had demonstrated the potential for democratizing higher education, but almost everyone was wary of direct subventions to campuses for fear of federal control. Many legislators, moreover, were children of the Depression who believed that students wouldn’t take college seriously if they didn’t pay their way. From the start, the idea was to fund students (rather than schools) via loans and work-study jobs.<br />At first limited to the needy, federally backed student loans were eventually made available to all. Loan limits climbed ever upward, and Uncle Sam fatefully stopped paying the interest for much of this lending while borrowers were in school. Callow youths, sold on the value of a sheepskin, borrowed small fortunes to attend third-rate campuses or, worse, for-profit chains designed to exploit the easy money. Family members sometimes co-signed. Graduate students acquired mortgage-size debts too. “At the University of Southern California’s dental school,” Mr. Mitchell reports, “tuition and room and board cost $152,000—for the first year.”</td>

Trafficking of drugs and human beings, extortion, graft, bribery and crony capitalism are only a few of the challenges it faces.<br />Fighting endemic lawlessness requires democratic institutions.

Americans have shifted spending away from goods and toward in-person activities as vaccinations increase and Covid-19 restrictions are relaxed, though an upswing in cases related to the Delta variant has injected uncertainty into the outlook.<br />The Bank of England is expected to stand pat on monetary policy. Economists are looking for BOE officials to revise their inflation forecast higher, but hold off on any major moves while the outlook remains clouded by the recent spike in Covid-19 cases.<br />The U.S. trade deficit likely widened in June. Preliminary figures already show record goods imports during the month as Americans buy more from overseas while the economy expands and domestic producers struggle to keep up.</td>

      <td>The movie’s ticket sales are good in a pandemic year but make path to profitability hard</td>
      <td>After several weeks of encouraging premieres, Hollywood’s return to the box office has struggled with middling performances topping the charts.<br />The latest example:  Walt Disney Co. ’s “Jungle Cruise,” starring Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt, which premiered to $34.2 million in the U.S. and Canada.<br />While it is a top performer in the pandemic era, the opening continues an uncomfortable reality for Hollywood as it struggles to emerge from Covid-19: Box-office performances that are good in a pandemic year are still going to have a tough path to profitability. For a movie like “Jungle Cruise,” which cost more than $200 million to make, that is certainly the case.<br />Releases that welcomed audiences back to auditoriums—“A Quiet Place Part II,” “F9: The Fast Saga” and “Black Widow”—opened with grosses that trended upward, with “Black Widow” hitting $80 million in its opening weekend in early July. But several of those hits sputtered in subsequent weeks, and that upward trend is nowhere to be found with newer big-budget movies such as “Snake Eyes.” The timing doesn’t bode well, since the highly contagious Delta variant of Covid-19 could send the industry into another tailspin of uncertainty and force studios to shuffle release dates once again.<br />The weekend’s other new releases carried a much smaller budget than “Jungle Cruise” but still failed to break out in a major way.</td>

      <td>Social media has made the pathologies of fame ubiquitous.</td>
      <td>Simone Biles’s withdrawal from the Olympics prompted a lot of talk about the widespread deterioration of young Americans’ mental health. At first glance a star athlete’s experience may seem worlds apart from that of an ordinary teenager or young adult. But in the age of social media, the cultural emphasis on fame and validation is widespread.<br />A 2019 survey for the Lego Group found that “YouTuber” is the most common career aspiration for 8- to 12-year-olds, nearly three times as popular as “astronaut.” Social media leaves teens highly vulnerable to external influence and especially sensitive to harsh criticism and bullying. Websites like  Twitter  and Instagram are breeding grounds for brutal, constant and omnipresent bullying and judgment. Social media also encourages unrealistic standards of what it means to be “beautiful” or “cool” and to have a “good life,” all of which contributes to anxiety, self-consciousness and harsh self-criticism.<br />Such shallow pursuits have always been a part of adolescence, but they were a brief developmental phase on the way to self-acceptance and emotional security. Now social media prolongs this period of self-involvement, self-consciousness and insecurity, and teens and young adults often get stuck in a negative feedback loop. The superficial and the approval of others becomes an obsession for adolescents.<br />Teens are especially vulnerable to criticism and rejection because the amygdala, the part of the brain that reacts to threat or fear, becomes very active during adolescence, while the prefrontal cortex, which regulates the reactions of the threat-sensing amygdala, and promotes the ability to see things or in perspective, lags behind in development. This combination of hypersensitivity and underdeveloped emotional regulation leads to harsh self-consciousness and self-criticism, which can immobilize many teens.<br />If your teen is struggling, Ms. Biles may be a good role model. So may Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, who has been open about his mental-health challenges, which began in adolescence, and who has promoted the destigmatization of mental-health treatment for adolescents and adults. Many young athletes are standing up, saying no to the pressure, and exposing the ugly truth behind the obsession with winning and fame.</td>

      <td>The month they mock as lazy gave us color TV sports, the Berlin Wall and the web.</td>
      <td>It’s August—the hazy, lazy days of summer. People are either at their vacation homes or wishing they were at Burning Man, virtual again this year. The future’s on hold, so you might as well head to the ballpark or the beach, shut your brain down and read Lizzy Dent’s novel “The Summer Job.” Nothing ever happens in August. Except . . .<br />Surprise! On Aug. 11, 1951, New York’s WCBS-TV broadcast the first baseball game in color, a double-header from Brooklyn’s Ebbets Field. The surprise was that television could do color at all—maybe 100 color sets existed at the time. Yes, “The Wizard of Oz” stunned theatergoers with color in August 1939. But television? Around 20% of U.S. homes had black-and-white TVs, often to watch Rocky Marciano’s almost monthly boxing matches, which my dad called the Bum of the Month club. By 1960 almost 90% of homes had sets. As broadcasts in color ramped during the ’60s, color-TV sales boomed. Someone paying attention 70 years ago would have seen the future.<br />Surprise! On Aug. 13, 1961, the world woke up to 32,000 troops in the Soviet sector of Berlin installing 97 miles of barbed wire and eventually building concrete fences—not to keep people out, but to keep anyone from leaving. The Berlin Wall stood for 28 years, as the icy Cold War proved that capitalism in the West, especially West Germany, completely outdistanced the stagnant communist Five Year Plans and neighbor turning in neighbor via East Germany’s Stasi secret police. The only question is why it took so long to implode.<br />Surprise! On Aug. 15, 1971, President Nixon ended the international gold standard set up at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference. Most didn’t see that coming. After years of funding Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society and the never-ending Vietnam War, the U.S. couldn’t afford both guns and butter as other countries began demanding physical gold instead of printed dollars for trade imbalances. Subsequent inflation was definitely not “transitory.” Oil embargoes and economic “malaise” followed. Real assets soared, stocks flatlined. This was broken only when President Reagan had Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker’s back as he slew inflation with punishing interest-rate hikes.<br />Surprise! On Aug. 5, 1981, Reagan fired more than 11,000 striking air-traffic controllers, members of the Patco union. Union membership as a percentage of the U.S. workforce peaked in 1945, but the decline slowed in the 1960s and 1970s. It’s been steadily falling since Reagan’s action. That and capital-gains tax cuts, encouraging capital formation, set up U.S. companies for rapid and profitable growth. A massive bull market began in 1982—Aug. 13 actually—with the Dow Jones Industrial Average at 777. We’ve rarely looked back.</td>

Voting to authorize a strike is often seen across industries as a negotiating tactic.<br />“Any significant impact on the market and thus prices will depend on whether there is a walkout in 10 days or not,” said Eleni Joannides, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, a commodities consulting firm, ahead of the vote. Although, “at current prices, Escondida negotiations appear to be built into the market.”<br />Still, when Escondida workers walked off the job in 2017, they didn’t return for 44 days.</td>

Min Aung Hlaing said his State Administration Council is “working as quickly as possible” to prepare for fresh elections after voiding the results of a 2020 vote that dealt a landslide victory to the party of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.<br />“I pledge to hold the multiparty general election without fail,” Mr. Min Aung Hlaing said.<br />Ms. Suu Kyi and other members of her government have been detained since the Feb. 1 coup, which abruptly ended the Southeast Asian nation’s decadelong transition to democracy and threw the country into chaos. The military says the 2020 vote was marred by widespread fraud, a claim disputed by independent election observers.<br />Protests erupted within a week after the putsch and have continued almost daily in the six months since. At least 940 people have been killed and more than 5,400 others have been detained since the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a nonprofit that monitors arrests and fatalities.</td>

      <td>CRT opponents must also wage a ‘war of position.’</td>
      <td>In his synopsis of the core claims of critical race theory (CRT), William Galston identifies the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci as a key influence on the movement (“A Deeper Look at Critical Race Theory,” Politics & Ideas, July 21). Quoting from the foundational CRT thinker Kimberlé Crenshaw, Mr. Galston highlights Gramsci’s attention to “hegemony,” defined as the ideological regime by which dominant social groups present their rule as natural and inevitable. For CRT, such a perspective enables us to see the enduring force of “white supremacy” even after the legal advances toward formal racial equality achieved by the civil-rights movement.<br />Mr. Galston argues that CRT has gone beyond using Gramsci’s ideas as an analytical lens and has put them into practice: “Following Gramsci’s lead, critical race theory has used mainstream concepts such as equality and inclusion to wage a highly effective war of position against liberal ideology.” In other words, CRT has begun to achieve hegemony by transmuting its own assumptions into the common sense that increasingly guides all the major institutions of American society: education, the media, nonprofits and the private sector.<br />What Mr. Galston doesn’t acknowledge is that if CRT has become hegemonic, CRT opponents must also become Gramscian in their methods and aims. No less than their nemeses, they see themselves as engaged in a “war of position” against an ideology that legitimates the rule of a particular class. Andrew Breitbart, the late conservative media entrepreneur, identified this as the right’s task. His dictum “politics is downstream from culture” was explicitly derived from Gramsci. In this sense, one of the most influential Gramscians currently on the scene is Christopher Rufo, whose rhetorical battle against CRT has succeeded in reshaping the ideological battleground.<br />Geoff Shullenberger<br />Senior lecturer, New York University</td>

      <td>Iran’s demand that the 2015 nuclear deal be modified to circumscribe a future U.S. president’s ability to withdraw unilaterally may be a blessing in disguise (“Iran’s Latest Nuclear Demand,” Review & Outlook, July 26). The proposal would amount to a serious modification of the original agreement. As such, it signals a desire by Iran not simply to return to “mutual compliance” with the accord, but to renegotiate it.<br />While the Biden administration should not—and, constitutionally, likely cannot—agree to Tehran’s proposal, it should welcome the chance to renegotiate rather than simply re-enter the nuclear deal. President Biden has called for a “stronger, longer” agreement, making the need to replace the deal a matter of bipartisan consensus. Concluding such an agreement, or even getting Iran to the table to discuss it, won’t be easy. But re-entering the original deal first and relinquishing the economic leverage provided by sanctions seem likely to make it even harder.<br />Iran’s reluctance to accept Mr. Biden’s offer of a return to mutual compliance with the 2015 deal offers an opportunity to move to a new phase of diplomacy. The U.S. should respond to Iran’s demands for alterations to the deal by putting on the table its own ideas for strengthening the agreement, moving directly to negotiation of the stronger, longer accord that successive U.S. administrations have desired.<br />Michael Singh<br />Managing director, Washington Institute for Near East Policy</td>

By bidding up the price of long-term bonds, the purchases tend to hold down borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, since bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.<br />Some investors worry that yields will jump significantly higher when the Fed stops buying bonds. The Fed’s indication in 2013 that it would eventually wind down an earlier bond-buying program sparked such an episode, dubbed the taper tantrum.<br />But research by economists and Fed staff in recent years has found that tapering need not provoke a tantrum.</td>

Many of China’s other big state-owned enterprises, including banks, telecoms, airlines and oil companies, are owned directly by the central government, not local authorities.<br />Moutai is a major local taxpayer. Aside from that, much of the support has come through Moutai’s unlisted, state-owned parent. Enriched by Moutai’s runaway success, this group has been able to invest in local infrastructure such as airports, railways and highways. It has also given company shares to another local government entity, which in turn has sold some of these for cash.</td>

      <td>Jacob Ma wasn’t going to let the fact that his new job kept him at home all day stop him from making new friends.<br />As soon as he joined the software company  Qualtrics  as a consultant in January, the former college resident adviser and inveterate social organizer started brainstorming ways to hang out with his new colleagues. He first put together virtual social events, like online happy hours and scavenger hunts, and, starting in late March, added in-person meetups at safe outdoor venues in the Seattle metro area.<br />“It’s really hard to make friends over Zoom, and it’s definitely easier for me to meet someone in real life and see whether we might want to hang out again outside of work,” says Mr. Ma, 27 years old. Today, he has a couple of colleagues he hangs out with regularly on the weekends and continues to organize events roughly once a month.<br />“Jacob is like a party-planning committee of one,” says his co-worker Britney Shalloway, 29, who moved to Seattle in June and has appreciated these events as a way to get to know her colleagues in a new city.<br />Starting a remote job can be hard, but many people have found new ways to forge work friendships during the pandemic. There’s no longer a proverbial water cooler to generate casual encounters, and some younger workers have never had a physical office at all. But they’ve overcome the awkwardness of the digital chat box to initiate meaningful, if often distanced, friendships. Some online work friends have even found success taking their hangouts offline once the vaccine rollout made socializing and travel easier.</td>

Given divergent outlooks for their core businesses, the positioning is likely to stay that way in the near future, industry analysts say.<br />The South Korean tech company, which specializes in memory chips, racked up 22.74 trillion won, the equivalent of $19.7 billion, in semiconductor revenue during the April-June quarter. Total revenue for Intel, was $19.6 billion—or $18.5 billion after subtracting the contribution of a business unit it has agreed to sell.<br />Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has held the No. 1 sales spot for much of the past three decades, ceding it to Samsung in 2017 and 2018 when memory-chip sales boomed.<br />The ranking is about more than bragging rights: Intel needs financial clout more than ever. Under new Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger, the company is embarking on an ambitious strategy to manufacture cutting-edge chips—one of the business world’s costliest endeavors.</td>

      <td>Laws, procedures to evict tenants in some Southern states are among the most landlord-friendly in U.S.</td>
      <td>A national ban on most residential evictions expired after Saturday, setting the stage for a potentially widespread displacement of low-income renters that looks poised to hit Southern states particularly hard.<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention enacted the eviction ban in September to protect millions of tenants who were unable to pay rent due to financial hardship during the pandemic. The CDC has extended the moratorium three times. The White House said on Wednesday that only the U.S. Congress could extend it again, citing a Supreme Court ruling that a spokeswoman said limited the CDC’s power to renew it. But lawmakers failed to reach an agreement to renew the ban.<br />Renters in Southern states are among the most vulnerable to the ban’s expiration, U.S. Census survey data indicate. Mississippi, South Carolina and Georgia tenants are more likely to carry rent debt than the U.S. average, surveys show. Nationally, about 18% of adult renters live in households that are behind on rent payments.<br />Eviction laws and procedures in some Southern states are also among the most landlord-friendly in the country, which means many tenants could be evicted quickly once the ban lifts.<br />In Mississippi, tenants can lose their eviction case in court and be removed from their home on the same day. In Arkansas, landlords can pursue criminal charges for tenants who don’t pay rent. And in western Tennessee, where a federal judge ruled that the CDC ban was unconstitutional, tenants are already getting evicted for nonpayment.</td>

In such a process, companies are graded on ESG criteria, which helps inform fund managers if the investment faces any risks related to these standards.<br />According to an internal assessment of the company’s ESG capabilities a month earlier, “only a small fraction of the investment platform applies ESG integration,” adding there is no quantifiable or verifiable ESG-integration for key asset classes at DWS.</td>

      <td>Investors are betting the inflationary streak that has sent prices of everything from used cars to lumber soaring will fade in the coming years, a reassuring sign for markets struggling to find direction.<br />Few issues have vexed money managers more this year than inflation. As the global economy has regained its footing, prices for goods and services have risen—in many cases far faster than economists had anticipated. Labor shortages and supply-chain disruptions snarling the global shipping industry have added to inflationary pressures.<br />The trend has worried many investors, since inflation can chip into companies’ profit margins, pressuring share prices. It can also eat away at the purchasing power of government bonds’ fixed returns. In the days ahead, investors will get a look at fresh economic data including factory orders, vehicle sales and the monthly employment report.<br />Yet markets are starting to signal that investors may be growing less fearful.<br />Take the break-even rate. Calculated by measuring the difference in yields between Treasurys and their inflation-protected counterparts, or TIPS, the break-even rate shows how much inflation traders anticipate over a period of time. Since peaking for the year in May, the break-even rates for five-, seven-, and 10-year Treasurys have all fallen—suggesting traders are pricing in a moderation in inflation in coming years.</td>

Those signals can prompt companies and individuals to reassess the value of skills, experience and seniority.<br />“The symbolic aspects of wages matter. People want to know how they stack up,” Dr. Burton said.<br />Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.  said in May that it was lifting its pay for hourly positions to an average of $15 an hour, amounting to an average raise of around $2 for front-line workers. Months before making the announcement, the company completed an analysis of how the change would affect pay for entry-level crew members along with other roles, from hourly kitchen and service managers to the salaried general managers who oversee a store’s operations, said Marissa Andrada, Chipotle’s chief diversity, inclusion and people officer.</td>

However, many employers and schools are holding off, saying that they can’t or won’t act, while the vaccines are still only authorized for emergency use.<br />“We’d like to see it approved as fast as humanly possible, so we can really go back to just the more normal experience,” said Jim Malatras, chancellor of the State University of New York system, which serves 400,000 students. Under guidance from the state, he cannot impose a vaccine mandate for students until the shots are granted full approval. For now the school is requiring vaccines or weekly testing, similar to the federal policy that President Biden announced on Thursday.<br />Three vaccines—from  Pfizer Inc.  and partner  BioNTech SE ,   Moderna Inc.,  and  Johnson & Johnson —are authorized for emergency use in the U.S. Pfizer and Moderna have filed initial paperwork for full approval. However, only Pfizer has submitted all the necessary information to the FDA, according to the companies, and analysts expect it will be the first to get the green light. Moderna says it is still completing rolling data submissions, and Johnson & Johnson says it plans to file for full approval later this year.<br />Advisers to the FDA and former FDA officials familiar with the process predict that full approval of at least Pfizer’s vaccine could come in September or October. President Biden said Thursday he expects the approval of the vaccines to happen in the early fall. And FDA officials have said they intend to finish the process “far in advance” of the regulatory deadline following applications, which Pfizer says is in January.</td>

The bureau accused the union of engaging in political propaganda under the guise of an education organization, saying it had urged teachers to launch class boycotts and incited students to join “violent and unlawful activities” during the widespread 2019 protests.<br />In response, the union said in two statements on Saturday that it didn’t incite student protests and has opposed separatism since its foundation more than four decades ago. Hong Kong’s education bureau had already significantly reduced its meetings with the union in recent years, the union said, adding that the full termination of ties would be a loss for the teaching industry.<br />Using similar language, Xinhua News Agency and the People’s Daily called on Saturday for an investigation into the union’s role in inciting unrest in Hong Kong, even though the union had already distanced itself from two groups that have been accused by Beijing of violating the national security law.</td>

In late afternoon there were scattered scuffles near Place de la Bastille with police, who threw tear-gas canisters into the crowd.<br />The weekly protests are a new challenge for President Emmanuel Macron, who said in mid-July that a health pass would be necessary to enter places like restaurants, as a way to avoid a new shutdown in the face of fast-rising coronavirus cases. The health pass is a scannable code to prove that an individual has been completely vaccinated against Covid-19, has recovered from it within the prior six months or has recently tested negative for it.<br />It is coming into effect as the Delta variant has pushed the average number of new cases diagnosed per day in France up nearly fourfold to more than 21,000.

      <td>For one New Yorker, the decision to ride out much of 2020 in Belgrade, Serbia, was both frightening and liberating.</td>
      <td>When Covid-19 hit New York City last spring, I was in my mid-60s and recovering from a traumatic brain injury that, by actuarial standards, “should” have carried me off a few years earlier. I had not only survived but grown hungry for life again, only to find myself holding on miserably in the worst pandemic hot spot in the U.S. Several friends died, and I watched televised images of the impromptu morgues cobbled together across the city in tents, trucks and Central Park. My neighbors and I squeezed by each other warily on trips to the lobby of our apartment building, breathing shallowly, flattening ourselves against the walls.<br />By August, I hadn’t left my building in months. Unmated, semiretired, my grown children busy with school or work, I realized that no one needed my physical presence. All I wanted was a place to spend one more winter in reasonable human dignity, during which I could read and think and listen to the music I loved. But every day it seemed as though another country had closed itself off to visitors, and there were not yet even rumors of a vaccine.<br />One afternoon when the anxiety grew too much to bear, I did several hours of research and bought a one-way ticket to Belgrade, Serbia. Just called up and booked it, as though ordering a pizza. The country was still open to Americans, the infection rate was vastly lower than in the U.S., and there was an overnight AirSerbia flight out of JFK that would take me from passport control to passport control, world to world, in eight hours on a single flight.<br />When I arrived, I was through customs in 10 minutes and asleep in my Belgrade hotel an hour later. Within days, I’d taken a small but comfortable Communist-era flat in Dorćol, a hallowed old neighborhood close to the Hotel Moskva and the Kalemegdan Fortress, at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers. My rent was $550 a month, including utilities and a balcony. There, I thought, I might burrow in and survive for a while, waiting for better times.<br />Belgrade delighted me from the start. I was welcome to work outside a cafe in the autumn sunlight and greet new friends who passed by on Strahinjica Bana. Fruit dishes were presented with a little pitcher of purified honey, and the combination was delicious overkill. The red wine was hearty and succulent, tasting of dark soil. Young people rode motor-scooters through the clotted streets and said “Ciao” without self-consciousness. At times I felt as though I was in “La Dolce Vita”; in other sections of town, still recovering from bombings well within memory, I was reminded of the battered Vienna of “The Third Man.”</td>

      <td>Kickstarter Chief Executive Aziz Hasan had to embrace remote work during the initial stage of the pandemic. Now this boss wants to reward employees who stuck around with a new perk: the four-day workweek.<br />Starting next year the Brooklyn crowdfunding company plans to allow its employees to clock eight fewer hours over four days for no less pay, as part of a pilot study. Mr. Hasan’s bet is that the shortened schedule will allow workers to juggle work and home life while having more time for personal pursuits. He hopes Kickstarter’s staff of roughly 90 will be just as productive in carrying out the company’s mission of funding creative projects, if not more so.<br />“You can’t learn until you start doing it,” Mr. Hasan said. “People are curious what it will look like and if it will work.”<br />Covid-19 is calling into question long-held views about the structure and nature of work, including—for some—the tradition of the five-day, 40-hour week. Remote arrangements freed employees of some constraints in 2020, but it also sparked burnout as some put in even longer hours. More are demanding an improved work-life balance as they return to the office in 2021.<br />“The experience of the pandemic and working from home has us beginning to question all the face-time requirements of the workplace,” said Ben Hunnicutt, a professor at the University of Iowa and the author of “Work Without End,” a study of past attempts to shorten the work week. “We can get our work done and go home.”</td>

Some of them—especially those who understand what actual, biological intelligences are capable of—conclude that there’s nothing “intelligent” about AI at all.<br />“In a certain sense I think that artificial intelligence is a bad name for what it is we’re doing here,” says Kevin Scott, chief technology officer of Microsoft. “As soon as you utter the words ‘artificial intelligence’ to an intelligent human being, they start making associations about their own intelligence, about what’s easy and hard for them, and they superimpose those expectations onto these software systems.”<br />This might seem like a purely academic debate. Whatever we call it, surely what matters most about “AI” is the way it is already transforming what can seem like almost every industry on earth? Not to mention the potential it has to displace millions of workers in trades ranging from white to blue collar, from the back office to trucking?<br />And yet, across the fields it is disrupting or supposed to disrupt, AI has fallen short of many of the promises made by some of its most vocal advocates—from the disappointment of IBM’s Watson to the forever-moving target date for the arrival of fully self-driving vehicles.<br />Words have power. And—ask any branding or marketing expert—names, in particular, carry weight. Especially when they describe systems so complicated that, in their particulars at least, they are beyond the comprehension of most people.</td>

      <td>Our communication skills have gotten rusty. Here are five ways to sharpen them.</td>
      <td>Talking to people face-to-face again is thrilling—and also hard.<br />Let’s face it: Our conversation skills have gotten rusty. We’re struggling with the art of small talk, what to do when one person drones on and how to gracefully exit a conversation that is dragging. Perhaps most vexing of all: How do we answer the dreaded question: “How are you?”<br />Zoom—where many of us have been chatting during the pandemic—isn’t a natural way for humans to converse. Instead of fluid dialogues, we’ve been participating in a series of mini-monologues. We’ve jettisoned many of the nonverbal cues that are important in a conversation, things like body language, facial expressions and looking at our watch to signal it’s time to wrap up. In their place, we’ve relied on “raise hand” buttons or, worse, clumsy new cues that don’t facilitate real communication. (Ever considered how silly we look grinning and waving frantically as we log off?)<br />And on Zoom, we don’t even have to pay attention; we can mute and multitask. I was reminded of this point yet again last week, when a woman I was in a meeting with fell asleep. She was still snoozing 15 minutes later, when we all signed off.<br />It’s time to learn to converse again. “Imagine you were a runner and you stopped for a year. It would naturally be difficult when you started running again and you would have to build the skill back up,” says Sean Horan, professor and chair of the department of communication at Fairfield University in Connecticut. “It’s the same thing with communication.”</td>

      <td>Plans to ease public-health rules at the border, overhaul the asylum system and create a path to citizenship for Dreamers face potential delays or political pushback</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—A surge of illegal crossings at the southern border and the rapid rise of the Delta variant have complicated President Biden’s plans as he looks to overhaul immigration policy and muster support in Congress.<br />The administration delayed winding down public-health restrictions at the border as Covid-19 cases rose. Mr. Biden signaled support for a plan from Democrats in Congress to attach to their $3.5 trillion budget package a path to citizenship for Dreamers—people who came to the U.S. as children and have lived in the country illegally—and millions of other immigrants in a politically tricky maneuver. And the administration wants to change an overwhelmed asylum system to deal with a yearslong backlog, a move that would take time to put in place.<br />That agenda has been challenged by a rise in illegal crossings at the southern border, which usually drop during the hot summer months. Unaccompanied migrant children have been crowding Border Patrol facilities—with more than 2,250 children in custody on Thursday—a sign the system is once more becoming overwhelmed. Migrant families continue to be released with instructions to check in with immigration authorities, rather than being given court dates, because border agents are too busy to issue the proper paperwork.<br />“At this point, anything the Biden administration wants to do on immigration is going to have to address the border in some way, shape or form,” said Cris Ramón, an independent immigration consultant who works for groups including the George W. Bush Institute. “Given where things are at the border, I don’t think he has much wiggle room to address other issues in the same way he had planned.”<br />Mr. Biden has attempted to walk a middle path, at once portraying himself as the opposite of Donald Trump on immigration policy while at least temporarily embracing some of his predecessor’s policies at the southern border. That approach has angered progressives in Mr. Biden’s own party, who say he hasn’t enacted the more-humane immigration system he has promised, as well as Republicans, who say his softer rhetoric on immigration has prompted the surge at the border.</td>

      <td>Five-year study on the effects of exposure to cartoon princesses gives parents hope that their daughters won’t grow up helpless—but the debate rages on</td>
      <td>Many parents find themselves in the middle of the Great Princess Debate at some point.<br />For years, scholars have suggested that the classic  Disney  trope—the damsel in distress—can damage girls’ sense of self worth, and also negatively shape boys’ views of girls and of their own masculinity. So when little girls start to beg for Aurora’s tiara and Cinderella’s ball gown, parents have to decide whether to let the Disney princess movies flow, or shun the uber-girly culture and the antiquated, male-dominated world it long represented.<br />Both the content and the research are shifting, however: Disney has for years been making its princesses tougher and more self-reliant. A recent study shows that even kids immersed in classic Disney films such as “Sleeping Beauty” and “Beauty and the Beast” managed to develop what researchers say are healthier views about gender roles.<br />The study adds weight to the argument that, like videogames that young children play, the content they spend hours watching on TVs and iPads might not have the profound impact on their development that parents fear. The author is Brigham Young University human-development professor Sarah Coyne, one of the researchers whose earlier work helped fuel cautionary headlines.<br />By observing several hundred children over a chunk of the past decade, Dr. Coyne found that kids who were really into princesses at around age 5 were more likely by age 10 to hold progressive views about gender roles, and to reject the idea that boys should stifle their emotions. This held true for both girls and boys, she found.</td>

      <td>The Australian dollar’s proxy relationship to China’s economy has been shaken by trade tensions, rising liquidity in the yuan</td>
      <td>SYDNEY—China’s role as a key driver of the Australian dollar is being re-evaluated in global markets, helping send the currency to levels well below where traditional modeling suggests it should be.<br />Australia has been a cornerstone supplier of commodities used by an industrializing China over decades, which in turn made the country’s dollar a favorite bet of currency traders and sovereign-wealth funds seeking exposure to Chinese growth while at the same time managing risk.<br />But souring diplomatic and trade relations between Beijing and Canberra have recently made the Australian dollar less attractive as a proxy for Chinese growth, some analysts say. Angry over Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s call for an international investigation into the first outbreak of Covid-19 in China, China has imposed a series of import restrictions and tariffs on Australian products including coal, wine and barley.<br />Others cite the burgeoning trade in the Chinese yuan for diminishing the Australian dollar’s appeal. According to the BIS 2019 Triennial Survey, the yuan is now the eighth-most-liquid currency, accounting for US$285 billion of turnover a day, 4.3% of global foreign exchange. That is approaching the Australian dollar’s daily turnover of US$447 billion—even while China continues to manage movements in its currency.<br />The Australian dollar fell in July to an eight-month low around 72.9 U.S. cents, even though iron ore—Australia’s most valuable export to China by far—hasn’t been affected by the trade dispute. Prices of iron ore have risen to a 10-year high this year, underpinned by stronger steel prices in China since Beijing last year ramped up stimulus spending with a focus on infrastructure.</td>

      <td>For the Tokyo Olympics, the German gymnastics team chose unitards over leotards, while Norwegian beach handball players recently rejected bikini bottoms in favor of shorts. Will female athletes change the status quo?</td>
      <td>Off Brand is a column that delves into trends in fashion and beauty.<br />IN 2004, then-FIFA president Sepp Blatter had an idea for making women’s soccer more exciting for spectators: tighter shorts. His comments to the Swiss newspaper SonntagsBlick suggested that soccer might follow the lead of volleyball, where the women’s uniforms are more revealing than the men’s. (Mr. Blatter, who has been banned from soccer by FIFA for ethical violations including illegal bonus payments, did not respond to requests for comment)<br />Mr. Blatter’s opinion, while clearly retrograde, was unshocking to those—like me—who’ve played women’s sports at any level. As a high- school field hockey and lacrosse player, I received more “feedback” about the length and style of my game-day kilt from fellow students and passersby than any other aspect of the sports. Even on lacrosse match days, when I had to drag a 6-foot-long antiquated wooden stick to every class, the comments were still about the skimpy outfit. Although I happened to like the old-fashioned charm of the traditional skirt, most of the time my teammates and I would have preferred the option to wear shorts. It struck me then as now that the short skirt enforced a sense of objectification around the sports. The focus was in the wrong place.<br />In recent weeks, several elite athletes have expressed similar concerns as conversations about women’s athletic uniforms surfaced yet again. The German women’s gymnastics team wore full-body unitards to compete in the Olympics in Tokyo this past Sunday instead of the more common bikini-cut leotard. In April, when the team first wore this covered-up look (which, though permitted by the sport’s governing bodies, is rare), the German Gymnastics Federation tweeted that it was a statement against “sexualization in gymnastics.” It does not seem coincidental that this is the first summer Olympic games to take place following the 2018 sentencing of Larry Nassar for widespread sexual abuse within the sport.<br />The previous week, the Norwegian women’s beach handball team was fined 1500 euros (equivalent to $1783) by the European Handball Federation for its insistence on wearing shorts instead of the mandated bikini bottoms at the European Beach Handball Championships in Bulgaria. Following an international uproar—the singer Pink even offered to pay the team’s fine—the EHF donated the fine to an organization promoting equality in sports. Michael Wiederer, president of the EHF, said his organization “will do all it can to ensure that a change in athlete uniform regulations can be implemented.”</td>

      <td>An exhibition at the New Bedford Whaling Museum examines the visionary artist’s work and traces his influence on Jackson Pollock and others.</td>
      <td>New Bedford, Mass.<br />First, the obvious question: Why is “A Wild Note of Longing: Albert Pinkham Ryder and a Century of American Art,” the first major survey of the enigmatic painter’s work in more than 30 years, at the New Bedford Whaling Museum? Because in 1847 Ryder was born in New Bedford, then one of the wealthiest whaling ports in New England, and lived there until he moved with his family to New York in 1867 or 1868. (Except for trips to Europe and North Africa, he never left New York after that, dying there in 1917.)<br />“A Wild Note of Longing”—the title comes from a poem by Ryder—was organized by Christina Connett Brophy, chief curator of the museum at the time, and the distinguished historians of American art Elizabeth Broun and William C. Agee. They present Ryder as prophetic visionary, pioneering modernist, and influential original who, Ms. Brophy writes, was “at the center of a cultural shift . . . to a powerful and uniquely American voice.” These claims are supported by an impressive mini-retrospective of significant paintings and an account of his still vital legacy. We walk past immense, high-flown cetacean skeletons, down a corridor, to galleries with dark wainscoting, exchanging the brutal world of “Moby-Dick”—published when Ryder was 3 years old—for a fantastic realm of lush pigment and supercharged images. The downside? Less than ideal lighting on admittedly hard-to-light and hard-to-see works, most of them under glass and hung too high.<br />Ryder’s years by the sea may have been formative, but his education and life as a painter were urban. He studied at New York’s National Academy of Design and exhibited regularly in the city from 1873 on, attracting critical acclaim and devoted collectors, and gaining a reputation as an eccentric iconoclast. Yet Ryder’s most powerful, celebrated works, such as the exhibition’s dazzlers “Flying Dutchman” (completed by 1887) and “Jonah” \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(c. 1885-95), are eerily lighted, swirling, all-over equivalents for roiling mid-ocean, with terrifying waves transubstantiated into scrolling patterns of coruscated pigment across the surface. Next stop, Jackson Pollock, who, in fact, called Ryder the only American master who interested him.<br />Interestingly, many of the exhibited works are landlocked. Witness “Landscape” (c. 1870) and related paintings, such as “Weir’s Orchard” (c. 1885-90), typically small, minimally indicated scenes, some bathed in golden light, some with cool skies and dark foliage that teeters between animation and abstraction. The graphic “Pastoral Study” (1897) sets confrontational cattle against a clearly defined, luminous landscape with a distant tiny windmill that pulls us deep into fictive space until the fact of dense paint returns us to the surface.</td>

The measures have encountered opposition from some home builders, utilities and residents in a state with cold winters, relatively high housing prices and aging pipeline networks in need of pricey repairs.<br />The Massachusetts debate encapsulates the challenges many states face in pursuing aggressive measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that may directly impact consumers. The cost of fully electrifying buildings varies widely throughout the country and has ignited debates about who should potentially pay more, or change their habits, in the name of climate progress.<br />Much of the resistance to electrifying new homes stems from fear of having to heat or cook using technologies such as heat pumps and induction stoves that most have never tried. In New England, most homes are heated with fuel oil or natural gas, and gas or propane is used widely for cooking.<br />Steve McKenna, a Massachusetts realtor, was hired last year to sell a new, all-electric home in Arlington, a town outside of Boston that is considering gas restrictions. The home initially listed for $1.1 million, but many prospective buyers were uncomfortable with the prospect of facing higher electric bills, Mr. McKenna said. It ultimately sold for about $1 million.</td>

Officials since the end of last year said those purchases would continue until they see “substantial further progress” toward their goals of low unemployment and stable inflation.<br />Fed governor Lael Brainard signaled the central bank hasn’t met that standard yet but could do so by December or a little bit before that. In her remarks, she said the Fed would be in a better position to assess the job market’s progress in October, when spending, school and work patterns “should settle into a post-pandemic normal.”<br />Some presidents of regional Fed banks have called for the central bank to reduce its bond purchases sooner in recent speeches. Ms. Brainard’s remarks on Friday laid out data pushing back against an earlier timetable.<br />As of June, the economy has a shortfall of around seven million jobs compared with February 2020 and of around nine million jobs relative to the pre-pandemic trend. Since December 2020, when the Fed laid out its objective of reaching “substantial further progress,” the economy has closed between one-fourth and one-third of the employment shortfall, Ms. Brainard said.</td>

He spoke with most of the 18 men for about three hours at a Haitian prison. “It was a trap,” he recalled several saying.<br />The former servicemen, ex-special operations soldiers who’d fought guerrillas in Colombia, had been hired by a Miami security company and arrived here between May and June, according to relatives, text messages, and Haitians who interacted with them. But the owner of the company and a group of Haitian businessmen, the police here say, instead took part in a plan to assassinate Mr. Moïse.<br />In the meetings with the lawyers, in which the servicemen for the first time detailed their account for Colombia’s government, the former soldiers repeated the same phrase over and again: “We were fooled.”<br />Even so, some of the men didn’t speak or spoke little, preferring to spend the time writing letters for Mr. Fajardo’s delegation to take back to their relatives in Colombia.

The CDC moratorium ends at a time of heightened vulnerability for tenants as the Delta variant of the virus continues to spread in many parts of the country, the Biden administration warned.<br />State and local governments have struggled to distribute $47 billion in federal money aimed at helping tenants who can’t pay rent because of the pandemic-triggered downturn, leaving many people at risk of being forced out of their homes when the moratorium expires.<br />Just $3 billion of the aid authorized by Congress in December and March had been delivered to landlords and tenants as of June 30, the Treasury Department said in a report last week. About 8.2 million adults were behind on their rent or mortgage as of July 5 and have low confidence they can pay on time next month, a Census Bureau survey showed.</td>

Please get vaccinated if you aren’t already.<br />That should have been the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s straightforward message to Americans this week, along with a candid analysis of its evidence.<br />Instead, the CDC on Tuesday issued murky new guidance, without backup evidence, recommending that vaccinated people resume wearing masks indoors in some cases because unpublished studies suggest they could transmit the virus. But on Thursday the Washington Post ran an alarmist story on an internal CDC slide presentation with the unpublished evidence, which triggered a media panic that could undermine vaccinations. Only on Friday afternoon did the agency release some of its evidence and offer a calmer explanation.<br />What a fiasco. The CDC should be a source of fact and reason, not a hair-on-fire spreader of fear. The agency could start by explaining that Covid cases have been increasing across the U.S. and that more vaccinated individuals are testing positive. But most of these “breakthrough” cases are mild or asymptomatic.<br />Now, let’s go to the slide deck, please. The CDC estimates there are about 35,000 symptomatic infections among 162 million vaccinated Americans a week. As cases have increased nationwide, so have breakthrough infections. This is to be expected. But recent studies show that vaccines are still 88% protective against symptomatic illness and 96% against hospitalization and death.</td>

      <td>Ride-sharing apps cut traffic fatalities by 4%, a new study finds.</td>
      <td>The value of ride-sharing apps has been proven in the marketplace, and residents of areas poorly served by old-fashioned cabs have a particular reason to be grateful. Now here’s a remarkable safety bonus: Uber “has decreased US alcohol-related traffic fatalities by 6.1% and reduced total US traffic fatalities by 4.0%.”<br />That estimate comes from two professors at the University of California, Berkeley, who published an analysis this week at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Previous studies of ride-sharing and traffic fatalities showed a mixed picture, but they generally examined how the data changed, or not, as Uber rolled into different geographic markets, which is a blunt way of looking at it.<br />The new paper analyzes “proprietary Uber ridership data” on trip counts, broken down by month and Census tract for most of the U.S. from July 2012 to January 2017. The authors say it proves the defects of the earlier approach, since Uber’s market entry explains “less than 3% of the tract-level variation in ridesharing.”<br />After crunching the granular data, the professors find “a robust negative impact of ridesharing on traffic fatalities.” The effects are “larger during nights and weekends,” which is intuitive if people are getting into Ubers instead of driving drunk. As for overall traffic deaths, the authors make two points about how ride-sharing can lower the figures.<br />First, “some fatal crashes without reported alcohol involvement may nevertheless involve alcohol.” Second, it’s possible ride-sharing drivers might be safer “than the drivers they replace.” Your mileage will vary. But unlike the average guy texting on the freeway, app drivers know there’s someone in the back seat who could report them.</td>

      <td>Include pensions and Social Security, and the figures are less stark.</td>
      <td>Americans may be richer than they think and less unequal than they’ve been led to believe. That’s the takeaway from a recent working paper by five economists from the University of Wisconsin and the Federal Reserve, which adds to standard wealth measures by including Social Security and pension guarantees.<br />Social Security benefits and defined-benefit pensions—employer pensions promising a fixed income in retirement—don’t show up in workers’ bank accounts, but their promised future payouts are worth trillions of dollars. Include the full present value of retirement assets, the paper shows, and the median American household headed by someone in his or her 40s had a net worth in 2019 of $402,000. At the 75th percentile, the figure was $1.15 million.<br />That makes a big difference for wealth inequality. As the authors write: “Our estimates show that the value of DB pensions and Social Security are significant relative to other forms of wealth—throughout the wealth distribution but especially at the lower half of the wealth distribution.”<br />There are strong reasons to include pension and Social Security guarantees in wealth calculations. Most workers forfeit 12.4% of their income annually in payroll taxes in return for Social Security payouts starting in their 60s, but that wealth is ignored in standard inequality measures. If it weren’t for Social Security and pensions, workers would need to save more, and have less disposable income, to secure the same future standard of living.<br />It’s true that Social Security and some pensions are political promises rather than property rights. But as anyone who has tried to transform Social Security or public-employee pensions into private accounts has discovered, they are politically similar to property rights for beneficiaries.</td>

      <td>What’s the Chinese word for chutzpah? It’s surely the best way to describe this week’s announcement by Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po that he has appointed a special inspector to investigate Next Digital, parent company of the defunct Apple Daily newspaper.<br />Mr. Chan says he has discovered that the company’s “senior management engaged in unlawful and fraudulent activities.” He’s now invoked the investigative power that hasn’t been used since 1998—after the collapse of Peregrine Investment, one of Asia’s largest investment banks. Among the claims against Next Digital is that the company reported in a May filing that it had assets that would allow it to keep operating for 18 months—but then it closed down Apple Daily a month later.<br />Next Digital did have the money. But one of Mr. Chan’s counterparts, Hong Kong Secretary for Security John Lee, invoked the city’s new national security law to freeze the shares of owner Jimmy Lai, freeze another $2.3 million in assets, and warn Hong Kong financial institutions that dealing with Apple Daily could be considered criminal.<br />Mr. Lee also warned Next Digital not to use any of its funds to support Apple Daily newspaper or its website in Hong Kong. That made it practically impossible to do routine things such as paying its reporters or buying the ink the paper needed to print. Faced with such pressure, with Mr. Lai already in jail, the company succumbed to the inevitable. Apple Daily published its last edition on June 24.<br />Now the financial secretary is accusing the company of fraud. But fraud against whom? Mr. Lai owns 72% of Next Digital. In the roughly two years before Apple Daily shut down, he had lent $65 million out of his own pocket to keep the paper printing. Is Mr. Chan really arguing that Mr. Lai was defrauding . . . Mr. Lai?</td>

Greg Abbott that his order banning the transportation of migrants within the state by anyone other than law enforcement impinges on the federal government’s exclusive control over immigration matters.<br />The lawsuit seeks to invalidate the order, which Mr. Abbott issued Wednesday after local officials in the Rio Grande Valley complained of federal officials releasing immigrants there and of asylum-seeking migrants in the care of Catholic Charities leaving their Covid-19 quarantine to go to a hamburger restaurant.<br />The Justice Department also asked a federal judge to immediately halt implementation of the order, saying it “threatens to significantly disrupt federal immigration operations in Texas at a critical time when the United States is facing a once-in-a-century pandemic as well as a significant influx of noncitizens.” The lawsuit noted that the government frequently uses private contractors to transport noncitizens between facilities, and that nonprofits and private bus companies must transport people to shelters and legal proceedings.<br />A spokeswoman for Mr. Abbott, a Republican, said he intended to fight the lawsuit and wouldn’t rescind his order. Mr. Abbott accused the Democratic Biden administration of failing to enforce immigration law and said he had the authority to “protect the state of Texas.”<br />Earlier Friday, Mr. Abbott in a letter to Mr. Garland said, “It is clear from arguments in your letter that the State of Texas and the federal government face a constitutional crisis.” He added, “The authority that you assert to protect noncitizens directly conflicts with my authority, and duty, to protect citizens of Texas.”</td>

      <td>Brief steps back from Trump administration position that due-process rights don’t apply to prisoners at facility in Cuba</td>
      <td>WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is recalibrating the U.S. government’s legal approach to the Guantanamo Bay prison, according to a redacted legal brief filed Friday, saying current detentions remain lawful but opening the door to possible future challenges from detainees at the nearly 20-year-old facility.<br />In the brief, filed in litigation before the federal appeals court in Washington dealing with the detention of Yemeni citizen Abdulsalam al-Hela, the Justice Department told the panel it wasn’t renewing a Trump administration argument that constitutional due-process rights don’t apply to Guantanamo detainees.<br />“This court can and should hold that al-Hela is not entitled to relief on his specific claims, without deciding the broader questions of whether and how the Due Process Clause applies,” the brief says.<br />The Constitution bars the government from depriving “any person...of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” Both the Biden administration and the previous Trump argument asserted it was unnecessary to decide whether the due-process clause applies to the detainees. But the Trump administration said that if the appeals court did confront the question, it should rule that Guantanamo detainees weren’t entitled to due process because they are noncitizens who lack property or a physical presence in the U.S.<br />A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia did just that in August 2020, citing a World War II-era precedent denying due-process rights to German prisoners of war held by the Army in U.S.-occupied Germany. The full D.C. Circuit agreed in April to review that decision, which was written by Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee and one of the court’s most conservative members.</td>

      <td>Britain has seen its Delta surge wane rather quickly. And unlike the U.S., it is not flopping around in the half-dark about what’s going on. Thanks to biweekly blood-sample surveys, the U.K. government knows how many people have antibodies from vaccination and/or infection. Thanks to surveys and modeling it also has a good idea how many are currently infected, invariably a multiple of those who get a positive test.<br />This is infinitely more useful and relevant than any information U.S. authorities produce, a point starting to break through thanks to former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb’s appearances on CNBC.<br />Of particular interest are the antibodies of younger Brits, a majority of whom until recent days had yet to be vaccinated. As of June 14, 31.7% between the ages of 16 and 24 reported receiving the vaccine; 59.7% tested positive for Covid antibodies. Because older groups rushed to be vaccinated, this helped authorities understand the extent of natural immunity. For the record, 92% of Brits now show evidence of antibodies.<br />And America? Weirdly, we had to rely on guerilla statisticians like Youyang Gu of MIT to know how many might have had Covid. Models are imperfect but they bring us closer to the truth than “trackers” that currently highlight a total of 35 million positive tests, when it’s highly probable that at least 130 million Americans have contracted the virus. As for the antibody total that would tell us how near we are to herd immunity, forget it.<br />Dr. Gottlieb speculated on Friday that, precisely because so many now would be symptomless and not seek testing, it’s possible one million are being infected daily with the Delta variant, about 13 times the confirmed cases.</td>

      <td>When I was a kid and told people not from Chicago, the city of my birth and upbringing, where I was from, it wasn’t uncommon for them to raise their arms as if holding a machine gun, murmur ratatatatatat, then utter “Al Capone.” Capone died in 1947, but Chicago and violence have ever after been linked. And now that link is more firmly established than ever, given the murder and shooting statistics announced at the end of every weekend in the city.<br />After Prohibition, crime in Chicago moved from bootlegging to gambling, prostitution, and loan-sharking. These operations were run by a group of mostly Italian and some Jewish gangsters known variously as the Syndicate, the Mob, the Boys, the Outfit, never for some reason called the Mafia.<br />Under the Syndicate such crime tended to be perpetrated on those who couldn’t pay their gambling or loan debts or attempted to step into territory thought to be exclusively the Syndicate’s. A friend of mine whose father had a strong taste for corruption bought a controlling interest in a few prizefighters. One thing leading to another, soon he found himself being simultaneously pursued by a murderous thug named Felix “Milwaukee Phil” Alderisio and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Fortunately, the FBI got to him first.<br />Occasionally the body of someone with the hubris to betray the Syndicate would be found in the trunk of a car in a church or hotel parking lot. These crimes were horrendous but controlled, their victims carefully targeted, everyone else in the city left to go about his business.<br />With the uncontrolled and ubiquitous nature of current crime in Chicago, one almost feels nostalgia for old Syndicate figures such as Tony “Big Tuna” Accardo, Jake “Greasy Thumb” Guzik and Sam “Momo” Giancana. They might bully someone on a golf course, or take over the best tables at city steakhouses, but they didn’t shoot into crowds, hijack your car, or wantonly kill children. In their day, the local television news didn’t open with yet another mother weeping over her murdered child.</td>

CEO Jacek Olczak said that “I want to allow this company to leave smoking behind.”<br />It was probably inevitable.

Philip Morris hired him, for $18 a week, to travel the northwest quadrant of Ohio and hand out free samples of cigarettes. There was no real controversy about smoking in those years—it was just something that people did, like drinking  Coca-Cola  or eating hot dogs.

The report referred to an outbreak in Barnstable County, Mass. Local officials there have said that at least 430 confirmed Covid-19 cases have been linked to one cluster following festivities over the July 4 weekend in Provincetown, on the tip of Cape Cod.<br />“High viral loads suggest an increased risk of transmission and raised concern that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with Delta can transmit the virus,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Friday. “This finding is concerning and was a pivotal discovery leading to CDC’s updated mask recommendation.”<br />An internal CDC slide presentation earlier this week described the Delta variant as infectious as chickenpox, which used to sicken some four million Americans a year before a vaccine became available in the mid-1990s. The Delta variant is more transmissible than the common cold, seasonal flu and smallpox, but less contagious than measles, according to the presentation, which was first reported in the Washington Post.<br />“The war has changed,” the presentation said.</td>

      <td>Walt Disney Co. ’s latest Marvel movie “Black Widow” opened in theaters in the U.S. and on the  Disney + on July 9. Scarlett Johansson stars in the film and has become an integral part of the Marvel universe since appearing as Black Widow in 2010’s “Iron Man 2.” The Academy Award-nominated actress has starred in dozens of films including, “Lost in Translation,” “Her” and “Lucy.”<br />Ms. Johansson filed a lawsuit Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court against  Disney ,  alleging her contract was breached when the media giant released the film on its Disney+ streaming service at the same time as its theatrical debut.<br />Ms. Johansson said in the suit that her agreement with Disney’s Marvel Entertainment guaranteed an exclusive theatrical release. Ms. Johansson’s representatives reached out to Marvel before the pandemic in 2019, seeking assurance that “Black Widow” would have a theatrical-only release, according to the complaint. Her total salary for the project was based in large part on the box-office performance of the film, according to the lawsuit. It adds that Disney intentionally made the move to prevent the actress from “realizing the full benefit of her bargain with Marvel.”<br />The suit doesn’t specify how much she is suing Disney for. The decision to put the movie on Disney+ is projected to cost Ms. Johansson more than $50 million, a person familiar with details of her contract claimed.<br />A Disney spokesman said Ms. Johansson’s suit had no merit and is “especially sad and distressing in its callous disregard for the horrific and prolonged global effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.”</td>

Budgets were busted from apartment complexes down to garden planters. Wood costs threatened the housing boom and became central to the debate over whether runaway inflation was brewing or high prices were temporary and would ease as the economy moved further from lockdown.<br />Though prices have dropped by more than 60% since May, when futures hit $1,711.20 per thousand board feet, lumber remains nearly as expensive as it ever was before the lockdowns. Futures for September delivery settled Friday at $621.20.<br />Like many businesses, sawyers have contended with higher transportation costs, wages and energy bills. Crucially, though, the glut of mill-ready pine trees in the South kept log prices depressed and mill profit margins wide in the continent’s most prolific lumber-producing region.</td>

It was typical fare until Mr. Saligram, the former CEO of OfficeMax and Ritchie Bros.

If confirmed, he would be Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s point person for negotiating business agreements and rules of the road at a time when technology has become an international battlefield in areas ranging from taxation to competition with China in the 21st century.<br />Mr. Toloui was previously an assistant treasury secretary for international finance in the Obama administration, representing the U.S. at global gatherings including the Group of Seven leading industrialized democracies and the Group of 20 top global economies. He is a finance professor and expert at Stanford University and the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, where he focuses on the economic impact of artificial intelligence and financial crises.<br />Previously, Mr. Toloui was the co-head of emerging markets portfolio management at Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco. He served on the Biden-Harris transition team and the State Department agency review team.<br />The Biden administration has sought to emphasize competition with China, especially in the area of technology, by working to boost investment in American semiconductors and limiting allies’ cooperation with Beijing in crucial areas.</td>

      <td>Ferrari’s first ever plug-in hybrid, the SF90 Stradale, heralds a new style direction—and a high-tech architecture—as the company moves toward electrification.</td>
      <td>I STEPPED OUT of the hotel—a weathered pensione in the Italian Alps named the Hotel Corona—to find the Ferrari SF90 Stradale test car surrounded. A group of high-schoolers were downstairs to meet their tour buses. I explained that I was an American journalist, just borrowing the car for the weekend. The very idea staggered them.<br />I proceeded to belt my suitcase into the padded carbon-fiber passenger seat. So much for looking cool. The SF90’s erogenous profile and thrilling outward views come courtesy of the ultra-low cowl and a hood line that plunges between bounteous wheel arches like the neckline of a racy dress. But the decolletage didn’t leave much room for cargo capacity—a mere 74 liters in the front trunk, the frunk. If you are planning a long weekend in the SF90, the car requires that you leave either your loved one or their belongings on the curb.<br />The kids begged me to rev the engine. But when I pressed the Start button (actually a bit of touchpad on the steering wheel so marked), the illustrious twin-turbo V8 behind me didn’t respond. The SF90—a plug-in hybrid—wakes up in electric-only mode. Pfft. Stand back, kids, I’m about to save the Earth.<br />Ferrari calls the SF90 Stradale ($663,623, as tested) its “new standard-bearer for hyper-technological extreme cars brimming with future-forward content.” Translation: The first of many hybrids, leading inevitably toward all-electric models. The SF90’s exquisite proportions, silhouette and ratios of front and rear overhang preview Ferrari’s styling direction in the new era, chief design officer Flavio Manzoni has said, as the exteriors morph around emergent platform technology.<br />Others may call it a compliance baby, built to reduce fees/fines/taxes for emissions and consumption just about everywhere Ferraris are sold, exploiting plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) provisions that are themselves a bit dodgy. That’s also fair. Approximately no people will plug in this car daily to access a meager 15.5 miles of all-electric range. And yet in a world where Tesla sedans can hit 60 mph in 2 seconds, it seems inevitable that Ferrari would resort to some kind of e-drive front end, in order to transmit more power to the ground.</td>

      <td>WASHINGTON—The Justice Department advised the Treasury Department to turn over former President Donald Trump’s tax returns to the House panel that has sought them since 2019, according to a memo released on Friday, saying the panel had invoked sufficient reasons for the request.<br />With the memo by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, the Biden administration is weighing in on a political question that has dogged the former president since he first ran for office: whether the public had the right to know what he paid in U.S. taxes in his years as a businessman.<br />Mr. Trump broke with four decades of tradition from presidents and major-party presidential candidates by not voluntarily releasing any tax returns, and has argued that Democrats seeking them were engaged in a political fishing expedition to make him look bad. In 2019, the Trump-era Justice Department said the House panel lacked a legitimate legislative purpose in seeking the documents.<br />“Although it is possible that some members of Congress might hope that former President Trump’s tax returns are published solely in order to embarrass him or to ‘expose for the sake of exposure,’ such individuals’ motives would not serve to invalidate the Committee’s request,” the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel wrote in the new 39-page memo made public Friday.<br />Friday’s opinion says the earlier legal memo didn’t give enough deference to the House committee, and that the tax panel in particular has special access to tax information given its role in overseeing the national tax system.</td>

In a federal trial that concluded in May, Epic CEO Tim Sweeneyaccused Apple of unfairly profiting from the work of videogame makers.<br />Apple has defended how it operates the app store and said Epic’s lawsuit was a basic disagreement over money. It takes as much as 30% of user spending that happens on most apps within its store. The company has said it spends money to ensure that the store provides a safe, secure way for users to download apps.<br />U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is expected to make a ruling on the dispute in the coming months. She scrutinized Apple’s fees in the case and suggested the company doesn’t have enough competition and set the 30% commission arbitrarily. She also said she was concerned that Epic didn’t seem interested in paying Apple for access to customers.</td>

If the bill makes it through the Senate it will head to the House, where party leaders have agreed to tie its fate to a $3.5 trillion antipoverty and healthcare package that Democrats plan to pass without GOP support.<br />House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) has said she won’t bring up the infrastructure package without the antipoverty bill, a stance demanded by progressives to ensure their priorities don’t get brushed aside. The party is aiming to steer trillions of dollars in proposed spending through Congress and to President Biden’s desk by this fall by keeping on board both its centrist and left flanks, both with powerful leverage due to Democrats’ razor-thin majorities.<br />“We need to be transformative in terms of how we go forward with infrastructure investments and reconciliation bills that truly meet families’ needs,” said Mrs. Pelosi at a press conference Friday.<br />The infrastructure agreement is expected to include roughly $550 billion in spending above projected federal levels, with money going to, among other things, bolster roads and bridges, expand rural broadband and improve rail and public transit.</td>

      <td>To English teenagers, as to those behind the Iron Curtain, it was clear only Americans could live as they wanted.</td>
      <td>“What do they know of England who only England know?” asked Rudyard Kipling, that quintessential Englishman who was born in India, married an American, lived in Vermont and might have lived there longer had he not had a falling out with his brother-in-law. His point: Great nations make waves beyond their own shores. They have to be seen outside-in, as Kipling saw England from India; or inhabited inside-out, as Kipling did even after finally settling in England as a neighbor of Henry James, who had traveled in the opposite direction, taking notes on the character of both nations as he went.<br />Roger Bennett has made what the airline pilots still call the “Atlantic crossing.” This is also the title of a 1975 album by Rod Stewart, the London-born Scottish patriot and longtime resident in Los Angeles. The album’s cover art depicts a giant Rod the Mod bestriding the ocean and planting a stack-heeled boot among the skyscrapers of Manhattan. Some are born American, some have it thrust upon them. Others, like Roger Bennett (and me, should the State Department compound its strategic follies of recent decades by stamping my application), achieve it by choice, hard work and lawyers’ fees.<br />“(Re)Born in the U.S.A.” (Dey Street, 295 pages, $27.99) is fast, funny and often endearing. It is less a memoir of how Mr. Bennett became an American as an adult, and more an adolescent memoir explaining why he wanted to become one. Mr. Bennett and I were born in the same year into the tribe of English Jews. Both of us were “reared . . . and raised on American soft power” in 1980s England, when the United States was a “magical, distant, and exotic” land of “plenty, of service, of perceived luxury and wonder”—and, above all, of choice and dreams, a “place filled with possibility and promise.” It is comforting and disconcerting to find that some of my most preciously held feelings are also Mr. Bennett’s; he has done a very good job of saving me the trouble of describing them.<br />“(Re)Born in the U.S.A.” is a memoir of desire: the usual teenage sexual stuff, but also the desire, as Bruce Springsteen put it in “Dancing in the Dark” (1984), to “change my clothes, my hair, my face.” In those days in England, our clothes, our music, our hairstyles, and our slang were all American. To English teenagers, as to those behind the Iron Curtain, it was clear that only Americans got the chance to live as they wanted.<br />Mr. Bennett grew up in Liverpool in the decades when its post-imperial decline accelerated into collapse; imagine Detroit, with worse weather and only 3,000 Jews. His parents had worked hard to enter the English middle classes. His grandfather, a kosher butcher, was a dab hand at gauging a cow’s fitness for slaughter by inserting his arm into its anus. His father found a less arduous exercise for his sense of discrimination. He became a judge.</td>

Since white clothes dirtied quickly and required a staff to keep them pristine, they telegraphed privilege. While late-19th-century lawn tennis was first played in darker garden-party garb of silk dresses and full-on suits, cool, forgiving and status-y white began its ascent when the sport became more rigorous and competitive.<br />Another reason: White conceals sweat, and women who were obviously perspiring “were not deemed ladylike,” said Nicole Markham, a curator at the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I. She calls the default to white sexist, classist and misogynistic.<br />Whites endured for women and men (who were the sole players at the inaugural Wimbledon tournament in 1877). That famous tennis tradition still mandates mostly white garb, which can be accented only with minimal colored trim, as do plenty of private clubs in the U.S.<br />Club & Court, an American line that launched during Covid, has had great success with whites. “They’re our bestsellers,” said co-founder Kristin Nevins. “They keep you cool on the court and are a great staple...for any player, from newbie to pro.”</td>

The results pave the way for many banks to restart distributing dividends.<br />The European Banking Authority’s stress test measures the ability of banks to maintain strong capital levels and keep lending to businesses and households in a severe recession. EBA said Friday that even under one adverse scenario, the EU banking sector would keep its capital ratios at around 10% in 2023, which is considered a strong result and in line with those from U.S. peers.<br />Under the adverse scenario, EBA assumed a cumulative drop in gross domestic product through 2023 of 3.6%. It said the scenario is “very severe, also having in mind the weaker macroeconomic starting point in 2020 as a result of the pandemic.” The capital depletion across the sector would be significant—$314 billion—compared with a starting ratio of 15%.<br />The European Central Bank, which supervises eurozone’s largest banks, recently lifted restrictions it imposed last year on dividends, but said it would take into account the stress-test results when looking at dividend policies bank by bank.<br />Banks with the lowest capital ratios under those conditions were Italy’s state-controlled Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena BMPS SpA, which would see its entire capital wiped out.  UniCredit  SpA is currently in exclusive talks with the Italian government to take over Monte dei Paschi.</td>

      <td>Mackinac Island, Mich.<br />Play the 123-year-old Wawashkamo Golf Course on Michigan’s Mackinac Island and you won’t soon forget it, not least because there’s a cannon aiming down the first fairway from the tee box. In the first week of August 1814, ranks of American soldiers, bayonets at the ready, advanced across what would eventually become the first fairway, into the teeth of British weaponry, a battle in the War of 1812.<br />That experience, thankfully, is not currently available at the course, but golfers can experience the sport as it was played long ago, before composite shafts, computer-designed club heads, and long, long, long fairways. You can even try playing the course with old hickory-shaft clubs available on loan.<br />Today Mackinac Island, off the northern tip of Michigan, is best known for its automobile ban and the imposing 19th century Grand Hotel featured in Hollywood films like 1980’s “Somewhere in Time,” with Jane Seymour and the late Christopher Reeve. Visitors relish the harbor-front shops and cafes that quietly bustle beneath the protective gaze of a whitewashed and gleaming hilltop fort. And everywhere is the quiet clop-clop of the horse-drawn carriages that are the primary form of transport here, along with bicycles and an unhurried form of walking best described as an amble.<br />At Wawashkamo, a moderately skilled player accustomed to 210- to 230-yard drives finds that a whippy, wooden “grass club” can spin the ball off the tee like a child’s whirligig, slicing it into the characteristic knee-deep rough perhaps 70 yards down the fairway. Approach shots with a “mashie iron” bound along the ground like terrified rabbits. The “niblick” seems altogether unequal to pitching a ball accurately on to the green, especially those girdled by the raised grassy hump common to golf courses of the oldest style.</td>

      <td>The companies enjoy the privileges of common carriers without the responsibilities. State antidiscrimination laws are one promising remedy.</td>
      <td>Does the Constitution require Americans to accept Big Tech censorship? The claim is counterintuitive but the logic is clear: If you submit a letter to this newspaper, the editors have no legal obligation to publish it, and a statute requiring them to do so would be struck down as a violation of the Journal’s First Amendment rights.  Facebook  and  Twitter ,  the argument goes, have the same right not to provide a platform to views they find objectionable.<br />Big Tech censorship has provoked interest in new civil-rights statutes—state laws that would bar the companies from viewpoint discrimination on their platforms and services. The First Amendment defense of this private censorship arose in a recent federal district court opinion expressing skepticism about a Florida anticensorship statute. It will come up again when other states, such as Texas, consider civil-rights statutes that focus more tightly on viewpoint discrimination.<br />With the possibility of multiple state statutes barring Big Tech viewpoint discrimination, it will be essential to understand the extent of the tech companies’ freedom of speech. For this, it is important to consider whether they are common carriers.<br />A statute limiting the ability of a Big Tech company to express its own views would almost certainly be unconstitutional. What about a law limiting viewpoint discrimination where the companies serve as a publicly accessible conduit for the speech of others?<br />This sort of distinction has long been ingrained in federal law—including Section 230(c)(1) of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which distinguishes between information provided by an interactive computer service and “information provided by another information content provider.” Whatever the shortcomings of that statute, it draws a common and reasonable distinction between a company’s own speech and the speech of others for which it provides a conduit. This distinction doesn’t apply in the case of a newspaper. Its pages are not open to the public to post their views, and so it is speaking for itself when it makes editorial decisions about letters and other outside contributions.</td>

      <td>A new exhibition in Los Angeles shows how cabinet cards became a popular way for Americans to share playful and dramatic photos.</td>
      <td>A young man with a watering can pretends to douse his companions. Two friends playfully attack each other, brandishing a hacksaw and a cleaver. A grinning girl takes aim with a popgun. Typical Instagram or  Facebook  fodder—except that the images are more than 130 years old. Even in the late 19th century, it seems, people loved to clown for the camera.<br />“Acting Out: Cabinet Cards and the Making of Modern Photography, 1870-1900,” a new exhibition opening Aug. 8 at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, explores how everyday people became comfortable with posing and performing for the camera in 19th-century America. Unlike the somber portraits that marked photography’s beginnings, the people in these images “are joking and playing and very self-aware in front of the camera,” said Britt Salvesen, head of the photography and prints and drawings departments at LACMA. “Which is remarkable, considering that photography was only about a generation old.”<br />With cabinet cards, a new style that reached a peak of popularity in the 1880s and 1890s, photography became entertainment. At roughly 6 by 4 inches, cabinet cards were bigger than most earlier formats and could depict sitters in greater detail, along with more of the surrounding space. That inspired the use of fanciful props, exotic backdrops and creative posing. The larger size also allowed for retouching—painting on or otherwise modifying the negative before printing—to minimize sitters’ flaws and enhance the scene with wintry snowfalls or other effects. Photographer and sitter became collaborators, crafting images in which reality and fiction were artfully combined.<br />The exhibition opens with a look at New York photographers who first embraced the new format, fostering a nascent celebrity culture centered on theater and performance. With the increasing ease of rail travel in the late 1800s, vaudeville and theater troupes crossed the country, playing small towns as well as cities. “Cabinet cards fit into that culture perfectly,” said the show’s organizer John Rohrbach, senior curator of photography at the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, where it debuted last year. Sold in theater lobbies during performances, cabinet cards of popular performers became a thriving business.<br />The flamboyant theatrical photographer Napoleon Sarony became a celebrity in his own right. Like a stage director, Sarony arranged not only props and settings but sitters’ expressions and poses, often held in place by hidden braces to accommodate the long exposure times of early photographic emulsion. Sarony’s dictatorial style paid off in images of remarkable immediacy and appeal, and he almost single-handedly turned American studio photography into a mode of creative expression. In the process, he and his New York colleagues influenced a generation of studio photographers and their clients, who came to expect a theatrical touch.</td>

      <td>In a sign o’ the times, Prince’s music is attracting new investment.<br />Primary Wave has acquired the largest interest in the Prince estate, according to recently released legal documents, positioning the music publisher to steer the legacy of the late pop star, who died without a will. The New York company is betting that by gaining control over the estate—valued somewhere between $100 million and $300 million—it can turn its assets into business opportunities.<br />The past year has seen a frenzy of deals for music, with major publishers, private equity, Wall Street and hedge fund billionaire William Ackmaninvesting in music assets. Late last year Primary Wave took a majority stake in Stevie Nicks’ songwriting catalog, valuing it at $100 million.<br />Prince’s estate—encompassing his music, image, likeness and property—is seen as compelling and lucrative, but it has been in flux for five years. The estate has been tied up in probate with a bank, lawyers, advisers and heirs haggling over fees and the reclusive artist’s assets, unreleased music and legacy.<br />In 2017, a year after Prince’s death, a Minnesota judge ruled that Prince’s sister, Tyka Nelson, and five half-siblings were heirs to the singer’s estate. In the years since, the heirs haven’t seen a penny of inheritance or had any control over commercialization of the estate while it remains in probate.</td>

The Civilian Climate Corps would put Americans to work reducing carbon emissions, enabling a transition to renewable energy, building healthier and more resilient communities, implementing conservation projects with proven climate benefits, and helping communities recover from climate disasters.<br />Last year saw 22 billion-dollar weather and climate disasters across America, costing $95 billion.

      <td>ExxonMobil posted strong results as oil demand and prices bounced back. Questions regarding long-term strategy still cloud its valuation.</td>
      <td>Exxon Mobil might have expected a hearty pat on the back after Friday’s earnings announcement. It didn’t get one from investors.<br />By many measures, the company’s results look stronger than they have in awhile with oil prices at levels not seen since 2018. ExxonMobil posted $4.7 billion in quarterly profit, its strongest in at least a year and beating Visible Alpha’s analyst consensus by more than 10%. Its $9.7 billion of cash flow from operations was the highest it has been in almost three years and sufficient to cover dividends, capital investments and debt reduction. The numbers look especially flattering compared with the same three-month period last year, when the world faced an unprecedented glut of crude and prices briefly went negative.<br />Not all segments posted record results, but the quarter underscored the advantage of an integrated energy business. Downstream earnings were weak because of a slow recovery in jet-fuel demand even as Exxon’s chemicals segment posted its best-ever quarter of earnings. Chemicals have been Exxon’s saving grace since last year when demand for packaging and hygiene products spiked. Demand from the automotive industry, which is itself recovering from its own supply crunch, is improving, too.<br />But Exxon has less flexibility than peers because of a brutal 2020 and years of overspending. It is committed to keeping its capital expenditures this year at the lower end of its previously telegraphed range of $16 billion to $19 billion. Debt levels have come down from the record highs reached last year, but it will take some time to contemplate splashier cash returns. That could become a sore point: This week, European majors  Royal Dutch Shell  and  TotalEnergies  and U.S. peer  Chevron  all announced a return to share buybacks.<br />Questions also remain over how Exxon plans to allocate long-term capital going forward, especially with a new board makeup after activist investor Engine No. 1 won three seats in May. Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said on a Friday morning earnings call that the company has had “productive discussions” with the new board. While the company stressed the need to address the energy transition, it didn’t lay out any more substantive details beyond previously announced plans to invest in carbon capture, hydrogen and biofuels.</td>

Most big manufacturers aren’t mandating injections. Neither is one of the main Covid-19 vaccine producers.<br />This week, some employers, including Google and  Uber Technologies Inc . , delayed their plans to bring workers back into offices. Others that have reopened offices, such as  Eli Lilly & Co .  and  Citigroup Inc . , said they would require staff that are at work to wear masks again regardless of vaccination status.  Amazon.com Inc.  said it would maintain its plan for some corporate employees to return to work in September and that it wouldn’t require workers to get vaccinated.<br />Though many companies had long encouraged, rather than required, vaccines, a rising number of Covid-19 cases and the spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant has led to a shift in thinking among some corporate leaders, said Francine Katsoudas,  Cisco Systems Inc.’s  head of human resources.<br />“You just don’t feel like you can protect your employees to the extent that you want to, and it makes you then lean in a little bit to kind of raise the bar around your expectations,” Ms. Katsoudas said in an interview. “I think everyone was trying initially to just respect everyone’s perspective around what they want to do [on vaccines], but we know that if we do that, we could create a pretty serious situation.”<br />Cisco has required the limited number of employees working in its offices in July and August to be fully vaccinated, guidance it will likely extend into the fall as its offices reopen more broadly, Ms. Katsoudas said.</td>

      <td>After a pioneering military career, the retired major general has written a book about the experiences of women in World War II.</td>
      <td>When Mari K. Eder, a retired major general, was coming up in the U.S. Army, she was called a unicorn, she says. Serving at a time when combat commands weren’t yet open to women, she held training and professional commands at the company, battalion, brigade and division levels for 36 years before retiring in 2013. She knew she stood out: In meetings at the Pentagon, her male colleagues would check to make sure she was wearing her uniform correctly. When she toured with fellow generals overseas, she was often the only woman.<br />Maj. Gen. Eder tried not to think about all of that, she says, hoping that by ignoring her singularity she could make her presence seem normal. But sometimes it would hit her. Once, when she was a brigadier general, she forgot the shoulder boards for her dress uniform. Her assistant offered to borrow some—but from whom? There was only one other female general in the Pentagon at the time. She was otherwise alone at the top.<br />“You didn’t have comrades, you didn’t have friends, you didn’t have colleagues,” Maj. Gen. Eder, 67, recalls over the phone from her home in Woodbridge, Va., south of Washington, D.C. “I used to describe it as being on a tightrope: You do your job and don’t look down.”<br />Now she is eager to help younger women see themselves as leaders and heroes. That’s one reason why she decided to write her latest book, “The Girls Who Stepped Out of Line,” out Aug. 3, about the women who “served, fought, struggled and made things happen, in and out of uniform” during World War II.<br />The book began, Maj. Gen. Eder says, when she stumbled on an obituary in 2017 for Hilda Gimpel Eisen, a Polish Holocaust survivor who lost her husband and family in the war, remarried, moved to California and made a fortune supplying chicken eggs to supermarkets. “I was amazed by her courage, by what she had done to escape the Germans not once but three times,” Maj. Gen. Eder says.</td>

      <td>As caseloads drop, scientists watch to see if infections climb after restrictions lifted</td>
      <td>LONDON—A wave of Covid-19 in the U.K. appears to be receding, a promising sign that high levels of vaccination can hold the highly transmissible Delta variant at bay and give governments confidence around easing public-health restrictions.<br />What isn’t clear, say epidemiologists, is if the drop in caseloads is the start of a sustained retreat of Covid-19 thanks to vaccination or a dip that will reverse as people resume socializing and step back from pandemic-era constraints the U.K. government loosened earlier this month.<br />It could also presage the beginning of a new, more manageable phase of infection—at least in places where a large proportion of the population has been vaccinated—in which cases fluctuate but large outbreaks are unlikely, and serious illness and death remain low.<br />How this latest stage plays out in the U.K. will offer valuable clues to the U.S. and other countries over what to expect as they boost vaccination rates and tussle with Delta. The U.K. was the first major Western economy to experience a significant wave of Delta infections. Daily cases are now rising steeply in the U.S. and parts of Europe while governments race to boost faltering vaccination drives. Some nations in Asia and Africa with minimal access to vaccines are once again tightening public-health controls to stem Delta’s advance.<br />The seven-day average of new cases in the U.K. stood at 28,271 Friday, down more than 40% compared with 48,000 daily cases a little over a week ago, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of official data. Daily data are volatile—two of the past three days have seen reported cases increase. But the seven-day average of new cases has been lower than the 14-day average for a week, another sign of a slowdown in infections.</td>

      <td>HONG KONG—Hong Kong police arrested a 40-year-old man on suspicion of insulting the Chinese national anthem after videos circulated online of people waving a colonial Hong Kong flag and booing when the song played during an Olympics ceremony, police said.<br />Friday’s arrest came after police said they received reports about videos that showed people at a mall jeering and chanting slogans when the anthem played. Disrespect to China’s national anthem was criminalized under a law enacted in Hong Kong last year.<br />Crowds gathered in the city this week to watch a homegrown Olympic champion, foil fencer Edgar Cheung Ka-long, take the podium to receive his gold medal, the first won by an athlete from the city in 25 years. During the ceremony, China’s anthem was played—because Hong Kong is under Chinese rule—but the territory’s flag was displayed. In videos online, a crowd watching a live broadcast at a local mall can be heard shouting “We are Hong Kong!” to drown out the song.<br />“The aim is to stir up the hostility of those on the scene and to politicize the sport,” said Senior Superintendent Eileen Chung, calling the arrest the first of its kind. She said the man, whose name wasn’t released, was found to have 10 colonial Hong Kong flags of various sizes in his possession.<br />Anyone convicted of publicly and intentionally insulting the Chinese national anthem could be fined more than $6,000 and sentenced to three years in prison, Ms. Chung said.</td>

      <td>The U.S. team has had several tough losses—in sports that we invented!</td>
      <td>The Summer Olympics has often lifted the hearts of the American people in dark, dark times. Think of Jesse Owens personally humiliating Adolf Hitler at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, Cassius Clay taking Rome by storm in 1960, Mary Lou Retton bouncing her way into immortality in the Soviet-boycotted Los Angeles games in 1984.<br />The Summer Olympics is forever associated with names like Thorpe, Joyner-Kersee, Louganis, Thompson, Lewis, Raisman, Spitz, Moses and Phelps, legends that thrilled us to the marrow with their jaw-dropping exploits. And that’s without mentioning beloved foreigners like Nadia Comaneci.<br />Thus, the stage was set for the 2021 Summer Olympics to once again raise our battered spirits during this time of global Covid-19 terror. But almost immediately things went awry. The previously invincible U.S. women’s soccer team got humiliated by the Swedes in the prelims and barely managed to eke out a draw against the unheralded Australians. Then the men’s basketball team shocked the world by losing to France. Yes, that France. The one with fleur de lis and petits fours and Marshal Pétain. This in a sport that Americans invented.<br />In more bad news, the U.S. women’s softball team got shut out by the Japanese. Again, in a sport that Americans invented. And while all this was taking place on the sun-drenched soccer and softball fields, American swimmers were losing races to unheralded Tunisians. Well, just the one unheralded Tunisian. No, this was not as bad as losing at basketball or softball or quoits, because in the strict technical sense we did not invent swimming. But neither did the Tunisians.<br />Yes, for a while there, things were looking bleak. Swimmers who were supposed to win gold won silver, track stars who were supposed to win silver won bronze. Naomi Osaka, a Japanese citizen who has spent all but the first three years of her life in the U.S., and is now one of the biggest stars in tennis, got bounced out of the Olympics by a non-household name in the second round. Just like that, the biggest star of the Tokyo Olympics was gone.</td>

      <td>They hog resources, pollute waterways and support few species of fauna, but classic turf still holds a statusy allure. Landscape architects debate the merit of grassy expanses.</td>
      <td>For the recurring series, That’s Debatable, we take on a contentious issue of the day and present two spirited arguments—one in favor and other emphatically opposed. Previous installments from the series are here.<br />Sod needs more coddling than a toddler, one reason many water-strapped cities offer rebates to taxpayers who swap out their home turf for native plants. A grass lawn “is a representation of this Western perspective of success,” said Clementine Jang, co-owner of landscape-design firm Soft Studio, in Oakland, Calif. And, she went on, such a lawn “ignores an understanding of where we are situated as humans,” referring to the precarious state of the environment. Lawns create a monoculture that sustains very few types of fauna. A variety of species suitable to a climate not only demand fewer resources, they promote biodiversity.<br />Unfurling the color of money comes at other costs that include noisy energy gluttons such as mowers, blowers and Weedwackers. The artificial fertilizer we add to keep grass as green as Ireland runs off and into adjacent waterways, said Gregory Tuzzolo, managing director of Stimson Landscape Architects, in Cambridge, Mass. And because it is nutrient-loaded, it “feeds the algae.” Toxic algae blooms can make swimming or even canoeing impossible: Dogs in several states have died after paddling in it. Native grasses and wildflowers not only require less fertilizer, they filter storm-water runoff. In studies, said Mr. Tuzzolo, lawn is typically just a notch better than hardscape, i.e., pavement, at scrubbing the water.<br />In her Brooklyn yard, Jeannette Williams, founder of landscape design-build company Loam Brooklyn, sowed a mix from Pro Time Lawn Seed, in Portland, Ore., in lieu of standard-issue grasses. The blend included deep-rooted fescue and clover, a legume that not only contributes a deep green hue but adds nitrogen to the soil. “That’s how I was able to make peace with having a lawn,” she said. The last nail in the traditional-lawn coffin: It’s uninspired. Said Los Angeles landscape architect Mía Lehrer, “Often people put lawns down because they don’t know what else to do.”<br />Ms. Lehrer recalls attending a kite festival in Los Angeles, where the crowd bypassed the park’s many benches in favor of sprawling on the grass. Lawn is cool and soft, noted the landscape architect, adding, “There is something very primal in it.” Fellow landscape architect Mr. Tuzzolo has held off depriving his family of the leaves of grass around his 1905 Dutch gambrel in Maynard, Mass., for another deeply ingrained reason: “Many of us have memories of childhood playing outside—throwing a ball and whatnot—and there’s definitely a lot of sentimental attachment.” He sees his lawn as a blank canvas, “a stage for other acts,” including a Covid-inspired aboveground pool, a swing set and a trampoline.</td>
