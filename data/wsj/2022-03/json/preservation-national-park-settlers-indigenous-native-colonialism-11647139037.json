    "body": "It was a pity to read zero acknowledgment of the indigenous caretakers of our land in “Democracy Helped Seed National Parks” (Review, March 5). National parks are a treasure, yet I remember how wrong it felt driving through the Redwood national forest and seeing hikes and landmarks with plaques commemorating white men with names like “John,” “Stephen” and “Newton” who helped save the last 5% of the Redwoods from logging.<br />The “Americans” the article references who “regarded their country’s natural wonders” are European colonizers and their descendants who created national parks. Yet had the land never been settled (read: stolen), there would never have been a need to protect it, either for us or from us, as the author distinguishes. Rather than praising democracy for cordoning off the last bits of land that capitalism is bent on destroying, let’s revere and look to the native people who stewarded the land for millennia."
