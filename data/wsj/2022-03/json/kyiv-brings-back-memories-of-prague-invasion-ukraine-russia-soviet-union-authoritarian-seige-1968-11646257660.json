    "body": "The invasion of Ukraine brought back my raw memories of the Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. Four armies of the Warsaw Pact invaded my small country under Soviet orders, putting a bloody end to the hopes and reforms of the Prague Spring.<br />I was 14 when I saw Russian tanks on the streets of Prague, Russian soldiers in the park near my home. I had to pass their stinking latrines on my way to school. We made fun of the soldiers by pretending to photograph them until they confiscated our fake cameras: a matchbox with a pencil drawing inside saying “Ruskies go home.”"
