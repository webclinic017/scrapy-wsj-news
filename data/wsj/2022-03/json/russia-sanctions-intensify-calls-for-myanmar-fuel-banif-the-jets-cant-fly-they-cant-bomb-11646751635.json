    "body": "SINGAPORE—As the U.S., European Union and others hit Russia with crippling economic sanctions in response to President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, they are facing demands to go hard against another regime: Myanmar’s military junta.<br />In the past year since a military coup shook Myanmar, Washington and Brussels have taken steps to cut off the country’s army leaders and their businesses from the global financial system. But the junta has continued its campaign of airstrikes, arrests and custodial torture to counter the armed resistance that has emerged in response to the coup. Now, the coup’s opponents are pushing for a ban on the sale of jet fuel to Myanmar."
