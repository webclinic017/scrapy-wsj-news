And every day, Ukrainian troops have forced them to retreat, leaving burning tanks and armored personnel carriers behind.<br />“We go out to hunt and destroy them,” said Volodymyr, a Ukrainian special-forces team leader, as his squad, armed with a British .308 sniper rifle and British-made antitank weapons, waited for the latest Russian attack. “They certainly didn’t come here expecting that, expecting that we know how to fight.”"
