    "body": "When not planning the invasion of Europe, Gens. George C. Marshall and Dwight D. Eisenhower relaxed by reading western novels. Simple horse-and-gun tales with no complex character arcs, crisscrossed plotlines or moral subtleties. Sometimes you just need a good action story.<br />The historian Alex Kershaw, who chronicled the D-Day sacrifice of a Virginia town in “The Bedford Boys” (2003) and followed an Arizona soldier to a German death camp in “The Liberator” (2012), returns to front-line combat for his latest narrative. “Against All Odds” is a progression of vignettes from the highly decorated Third Infantry Division. It follows men who, as the title suggests, defied improbable odds to survive two years of hard fighting against Hitler’s troops, from the 1942 landing in North Africa to V-E Day in Germany."
