    "body": "U.S. inflation is estimated to have climbed to another four-decade high in February with skyrocketing energy and commodity prices related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine expected to push costs even higher.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect that the Labor Department will report Thursday that the consumer-price index hit a 7.8% annual rate in February. The index for goods and services across the economy is measured throughout the month. Rising energy prices at the end of February would be accounted for in the inflation reading, but not March increases that put crude oil prices at their highest levels since 2008 and U.S. gasoline prices at record highs."
