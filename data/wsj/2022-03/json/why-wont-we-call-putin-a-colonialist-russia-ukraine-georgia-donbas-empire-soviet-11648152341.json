    "body": "Why are so few in the West calling Russia’s invasion of Ukraine a colonial war? Colonialism is the clearest, most accurate framing of Moscow’s aggression. The self-justifying sense of mission, the dehumanization of the other, the violent imposition of dependency—all are central attributes of the colonial impulse.<br />On the flip side, far too few Russians recognize their country’s behavior as imperialist. Self-flagellating postcolonial studies might have paralyzed Western cultural discourse, but in Russia such self-scrutiny is virtually nonexistent."
