    "body": "During Roman Abramovich’s scramble to put his London affairs in order this month—a collection of cars, bank accounts, and luxury real estate—none drew more interest than his prized asset sitting off King’s Road.<br />Chelsea Football Club, in the English Premier League, had been his trophy asset since he bought the club as a little-known Russian billionaire in 2003. Now, as a world famous Russian billionaire under U.K. government sanctions for his ties to Vladimir Putin, his forced sale of the club has touched one of the most closely watched bidding wars in global sports. No club from the Premier League’s so-called Big Six has changed hands in over a decade."
