    "body": "Judy Shelton’s acknowledgment that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is roiling financial markets (“War in Ukraine Complicates the Fed’s Inflation Strategy,” op-ed, Feb. 28) sits oddly with her suggestion that the Federal Reserve should take advantage of this moment to reduce its large financial-market footprint.<br />By choosing this moment to start selling its excessively large U.S. Treasury bond and mortgage-backed securities holdings, the Fed would not only be reducing liquidity at a time of market stress; it would also be throwing into question the notion of a Fed put that has helped establish a floor under equity prices. This would compound the financial-market turbulence created by the Russian invasion."
