    "body": "Your editorial “Yale Law Students for Censorship” (March 21) focuses largely on the appalling behavior of the students concerned. If there had been only a handful of them, that would be fair enough. But when a hundred-strong mob is involved, more important issues arise.<br />Who is teaching these students, and what are they teaching them? What conditions produce large, spiteful, anti-intellectual mobs? When these events occur, as they do with regularity across the country, our focus ought not be primarily on the students, but rather on the professors who are evidently persuading their students that any opinion contrary to their own is an evil not to be tolerated."
