    "body": "The state tax cuts keep coming amid record budget surpluses, and the next to arrive may be in Georgia, which wants to keep up with fast-growing Sunbelt neighbors.<br />The state House approved a plan recently to reduce income taxes by more than $1 billion. The bill collapses six brackets into a single 5.25% rate beginning in 2024, scrapping the current top rate of 5.75%. That will make Georgia the 13th state to adopt a flat tax, following Iowaâ€™s 3.9% rate this month."
