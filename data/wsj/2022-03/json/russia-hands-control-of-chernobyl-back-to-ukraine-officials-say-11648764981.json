    "body": "Russian forces transferred control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant back to Ukrainian authorities, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Ukrainian state nuclear company Energoatom and plant workers—who said the departing troops had also taken more than 100 Ukrainian national guardsmen away in trucks as prisoners of war.<br />The Russian troops began leaving in phases on Tuesday, and the entire Russian deployment had left the area by late Thursday. That concluded a five-week occupation of the defunct plant that began on the first afternoon of the Feb. 24 invasion, when Russian troops arrived at the plant, the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident."
