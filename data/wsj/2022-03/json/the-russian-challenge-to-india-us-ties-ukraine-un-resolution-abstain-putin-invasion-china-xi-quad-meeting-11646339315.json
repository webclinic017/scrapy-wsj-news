    "body": "As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine grinds on, India stands out among America’s democratic partners for its unwillingness to criticize Moscow. This raises the question of whether New Delhi wants to uphold the liberal international order that has largely maintained global peace since World War II.<br />But while it may be tempting to reassess the importance of U.S.-India ties in light of Vladimir Putin’s misadventure, we shouldn’t lose sight of the big picture. America and India may need to stop tom-tomming shared values or India’s role in upholding established international norms. But the U.S. should continue to cooperate with India to contain a belligerent China. On Thursday, the leaders of the four Quad countries—the U.S., Japan, India and Australia—met for a virtual summit, their third meeting since President Biden took office last year. Their joint statement said they discussed “the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.” It did not mention Russia."
