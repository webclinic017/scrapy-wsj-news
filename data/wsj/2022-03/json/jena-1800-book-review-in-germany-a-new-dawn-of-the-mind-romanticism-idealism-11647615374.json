    "body": "The epochal Battle of Jena was fought on Oct. 14, 1806. A massive French army under Napoleon cut off Prussian and Saxon troops from access to the Elbe River and from possible Russian reinforcements. The French demolished the Germans and within six weeks had conquered all of Prussia. The subsequent Treaty of Tilsit made allies of France and Russia, pitilessly reduced Prussia and Austria, and planted French client states throughout central Europe. The 1,000-year-old Holy Roman Empire, dominated for centuries by the Austrian Habsburgs, came to its end. Everywhere Bonaparte was acknowledged as the “new Charlemagne.”<br />A notable witness to these events was the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, then living in the town of Jena. Incredibly, Hegel had completed his masterwork, “The Phenomenology of Spirit,” on the eve of the battle. In “Jena 1800: The Republic of Free Spirits,” Peter Neumann recounts the scene. After Hegel’s apartment had been ransacked by French soldiers, he fled in his slippers, clutching the final pages of his manuscript. In the streets he encountered Napoleon: “I saw the Emperor—this world-soul—riding out of the city on reconnaissance. It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, reaches out over the world and masters it.”"
