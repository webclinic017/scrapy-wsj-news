    "body": "GROWING UP in Sydney, I enjoyed a steady supply of passion fruit. Vines hung on neighbors’ fences, and the fruits lurked in every fruit bowl, getting more wrinkled and sweeter by the day. They were so abundant, my brother and I used them as cricket balls in our backyard.<br />Australians love this deep-purple fruit full of crunchy black seeds suspended in a juicy yellow pulp. Its flavor—at once tangy and floral—sets your blood racing. Other varieties exist, in hues of yellow and green, but the purple one is the most common Down Under, available pretty much throughout the year."
