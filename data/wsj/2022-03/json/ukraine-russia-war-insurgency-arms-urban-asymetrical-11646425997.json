    "body": "In “The U.S. Shouldn’t Interfere While Putin Loses in Ukraine” (op-ed, March 1), Mark Hannah misunderstands a key technical point. He opposes arming an insurgency because “Ukraine is a flat country unsuited to guerrilla warfare.” Maybe so, but guerrilla warfare is only one example of what the U.S. Army terms “asymmetric warfare.” There are others.<br />Roughly speaking, there are two mechanisms for destroying targets: aiming at them (aimed fire) and aiming near them (area fire). In guerrilla warfare (ambushes), one side uses aimed fire while the other is forced to use area fire. Urban warfare involves a similar kind of asymmetry."
