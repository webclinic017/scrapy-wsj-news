    "body": "Eugene Kontorovich and Anastasia Lin’s op-ed “Covid Lockdowns Were a Chinese Import” (March 24) leads us to another way China’s influence in handling the pandemic may have harmed the rest of the world. Part of the Western medical-journal establishment has been complicit in China’s suppression of scientific information about the pandemic.<br />Early in 2020, we wrote a paper estimating Covid cases and deaths in Wuhan, China, based on confirmed cremation operations there. We also used Covid doubling rates published by Hong Kong researchers in the Lancet, as well as China’s figures for deaths in pre-Covid Wuhan. The paper concluded that official Chinese figures at the end of January 2020 were underestimating Covid cases and deaths by factors of 5 to 10, depending on the dates examined."
