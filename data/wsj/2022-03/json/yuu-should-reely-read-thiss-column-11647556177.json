    "body": "Lately, I’ve noticed that my spam folder is filled with crude, misspelled messages that seem to go out of their way to insult my intelligence. “THAANK YOU!!!” says one phony come-on from a spammer purporting to represent CVS. “THAANKK YOUU!!” says another.<br />I also get inane messages from “Wal Greens” and “capital.1” and periodic announcements of a “SURPRIIISE!! from “sams club.” And on several occasions I have been offered a $50 VerizoN gift card from VeriZon. It’s as if the world of con men has been taken over by con toddlers. Who may not speak English as their native language."
