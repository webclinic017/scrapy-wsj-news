Investors may have to embrace Peloton’s unflattering new look.<br />New Chief Executive Officer Barry McCarthy came to Peloton determined to succeed. As he told The Wall Street Journal this week, “Either I leave here successfully, or I’m going to leave with a greatly diminished reputation.” To be fair, he had his work cut out for him. Mr. McCarthy, who formerly served as chief financial officer of both Spotify Technology and Netflix, arrived last month after Peloton’s share price had plummeted more than 77% from its highs early last year."
