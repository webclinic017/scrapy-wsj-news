    "body": "IT DIDN’T TAKE LONG after opening Turkey and the Wolf in New Orleans in 2016 for chef Mason Hereford to earn a devoted following for his sandwiches. He has, as a matter of fact, considered himself a “sandwich maestro” since he was a line cook, experimenting in other chefs’ kitchens.<br />This open-face sandwich, Mr. Hereford’s first Slow Food Fast recipe, dates back to those freewheeling days. The combination of creamy grilled-catfish salad with kale, clementines and a kicky Sriracha dressing positively exudes youthful exuberance."
