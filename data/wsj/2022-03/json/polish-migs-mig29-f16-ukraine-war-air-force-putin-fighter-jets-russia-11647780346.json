    "body": "Western countries are pouring weapons into Ukraine, but no arms deal has attracted as much attention as the question of whether to give the Ukrainians a couple of dozen old Polish MiG-29 fighter jets. The Biden administration shut down a transfer as not “tenable,” arguing the additional Soviet-designed jets wouldn’t be useful enough on the battlefield to justify what Vladimir Putin might perceive as an escalation.<br />The MiGs exploded into a larger debate: Is Mr. Putin dictating which weapons America can send its friends? The administration says ground-based air defenses would be more useful, and that it’s working with allies who have versions the Ukrainians know how to operate, a welcome development. White House press secretary Jen Psaki noted acidly on Wednesday that she’s been asked about the MiGs “167 times.” But if the MiGs aren’t effective at killing Russians, how are they an escalation?"
