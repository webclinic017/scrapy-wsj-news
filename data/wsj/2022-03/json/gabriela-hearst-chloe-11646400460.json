    "body": "GABRIELA HEARST might be the only ready-to-wear designer who studies fusion and clean energy in her spare time. That is, when she has spare time.<br />The Uruguay-born Ms. Hearst, 45, juggles heading up her New York-based eponymous line, which she founded in 2015, and her role as the creative director of Paris brand Chloé, which she took on in 2020. (Her fall 2022 collection for that brand debuted on March 3.) Ms. Hearst’s dual gigs require frequent travel between Paris and New York—sometimes twice a month. To cope, she has learned to get work done whenever (and wherever) she has a free moment. She sketches collections on trans-Atlantic flights."
