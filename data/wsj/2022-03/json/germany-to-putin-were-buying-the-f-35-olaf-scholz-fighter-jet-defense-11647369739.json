    "body": "Chancellor Olaf Scholz promised last month to spend €100 billion to upgrade Germany’s dilapidated military, proving that nothing focuses the mind like tanks rolling across Europe. And Berlin is already moving fast with a purchase of F-35 fighter jets.<br />Germany’s defense ministry said this week the country will buy  Lockheed Martin ’s  F-35 as Germany makes down payments on meeting its NATO obligation of spending 2% of its economy on defense, up from roughly 1.5% in recent years. The F-35 would replace Germany’s geriatric Tornado jets, which have been in service since the 1980s and are now largely hangar decorations."
