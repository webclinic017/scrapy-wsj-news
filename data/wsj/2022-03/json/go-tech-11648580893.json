    "body": "People can debate whether the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is the finest university in the world. But this week MIT is making a very strong case that it is at least the finest school in Cambridge, Mass. While Harvard is using the Covid excuse to make standardized tests optional for applicants to its undergraduate college for years to come, MIT is charting a different course and restoring an important ingredient for academic success.<br />For those who fear that subjective judgments by college administrators will limit admissions to the demographically correct, the woke, the wealthy and the well-connected, the excellent news is that at least one great institution still sees a place for objective standards."
