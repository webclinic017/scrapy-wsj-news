    "body": "In “The U.S. Shouldn’t Interfere While Putin Loses in Ukraine” (op-ed, March 1), Mark Hannah writes, “Backing an insurgency could ignite a wider conflict between the U.S. and Russia, and increase the violence inflicted on Ukrainian civilians.” But during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, President Reagan armed and financed the Afghan mujahedeen without initiating a wider confrontation with the U.S.S.R. Rather, Soviet humiliation in Afghanistan helped precipitate the fall of the evil empire.<br />With or without U.S. backing, Ukrainians will likely mount a spirited insurgency. They won’t meekly submit to Vladimir Putin’s dictatorial rule. And assisting those who want to break free of Russian yoke will not only be a moral act commensurate with U.S. values; it will also serve U.S. interests."
