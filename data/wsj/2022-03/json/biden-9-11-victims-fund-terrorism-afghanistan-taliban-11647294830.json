    "body": "As the son of Capt. John R. Fischer, FDNY, who was tragically killed on 9/11, I applaud the editorial board for calling out the injustice that this administration is inflicting on the bulk of the 9/11 community (“Trial Lawyers Raid a 9/11 Victims Fund,” March 10). I wish I could say I was surprised, but this is another in a long line of inexplicable U.S. government decisions.<br />Congress instituted the United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund only in 2015. From the outset, it wrongfully excluded spouses and children of 9/11 victims. Only after four years of effort by those same widows and children were we admitted. By that time most of the fund’s assets had already been distributed. The result is that the victims of 9/11, their spouses and their children have been undercompensated for decades."
