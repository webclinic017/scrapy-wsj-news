    "body": "Inflation reached a new 40-year peak in February, according to the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge, buoyed in part by a surge in oil prices related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine combined with other supply problems and strong U.S. consumer demand.<br />The Commerce Department said Thursday that its personal-consumption-expenditures price index climbed 6.4% in February from a year ago, faster than the 6% increase in the year ending in January. The February rise was the fastest since 1982."
