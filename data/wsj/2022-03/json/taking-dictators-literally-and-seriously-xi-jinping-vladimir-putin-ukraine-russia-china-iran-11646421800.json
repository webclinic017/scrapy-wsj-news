    "body": "Politicians and foreign-policy sages say we need to “learn lessons” from whatever disasters befall the world. Well, here’s one of the most important to emerge from Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine: Take autocrats literally and seriously when they tell us what they intend to do.<br />Anyone purporting to be shocked by Mr. Putin’s actions in Ukraine shouldn’t be. He told the world he was going to do it. As far back as 2007, in a speech at the Munich Security Conference, Mr. Putin excoriated the European security order and teed up NATO enlargement as a “serious provocation” that would justify a serious Russian response. His tone was fierce. In 2008 he reportedly told then-President George W. Bush he didn’t consider Ukraine a real country."
