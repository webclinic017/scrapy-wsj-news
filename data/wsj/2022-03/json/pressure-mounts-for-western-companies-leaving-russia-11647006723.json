    "body": "Western companies have started to tally the cost of a long-term exit from Russia, after President Vladimir Putin endorsed a plan to nationalize foreign assets after many companies said they would pause their Russia operations in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.<br />Mr. Putin on Thursday backed a plan floated earlier this week by a senior member of his dominant United Russia party to nationalize the operations of Western companies exiting the country. Such a move would help prevent job losses and maintain Russia’s ability to produce goods domestically, said Andrei Turchak, the secretary of the general council of the United Russia party."
