    "body": "As Vladimir Putin’s barbaric assault on Ukraine unfolds, the public conversation about Israel’s response has grown predictable. On one side are the defenders of realpolitik, including many Israelis, who see the need for coordination with Russia in Israel’s fight against terrorism on its northern border. On the other side are a small group of moralists, myself included, who regard Mr. Putin’s actions as the ultimate threat to freedom and who urge Israel to join the rest of the civilized world in standing unequivocally against him.<br />Israel’s leaders have hewn a cautious path between the two. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett met with Mr. Putin in the Kremlin over the weekend and spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky by phone. Last week the Israeli government declined to join 81 other countries in co-sponsoring a United Nations Security Council resolution against the Russian invasion. The Israeli government has repeatedly declined requests for military aid from Mr. Zelensky. But Israel has sent significant humanitarian aid and condemned the Russian invasion in the General Assembly."
