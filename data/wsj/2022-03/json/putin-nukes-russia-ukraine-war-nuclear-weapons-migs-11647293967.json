    "body": "Your editorial “The Ukraine MiG-29 Fiasco Gets Worse” (March 11) reveals the prevailing thinking on Ukraine: Don’t aggravate Vladimir Putin or he will use his nuclear weapons. With each new crime, Mr. Putin waves his nuclear flag and we paralyze ourselves. But such weapons are effectively unusable, since their first use would prompt a devastating response.<br />Mr. Putin won’t respond to sanctions and tariffs. Only force will stop him. As in the buildup to World War II, the free world must pay now or pay much more later. Ignoring Mr. Putin’s false shield is key to enabling us to think clearly and boldly."
