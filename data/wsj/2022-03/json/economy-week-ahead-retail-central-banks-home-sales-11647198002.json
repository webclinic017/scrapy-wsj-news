    "body": "The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy meeting takes center stage this week, with the central bank expected to raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2018.<br />Growth in China’s industrial production likely continued to slow in the first two months of 2022. January-February industrial output is forecast to be up 3.5% from a year earlier, decelerating from a 4.3% pace in December. Economists expect other key measures of activity to improve slightly: Fixed-asset investment and retail sales are both estimated to have advanced at a faster annual rate than in December."
