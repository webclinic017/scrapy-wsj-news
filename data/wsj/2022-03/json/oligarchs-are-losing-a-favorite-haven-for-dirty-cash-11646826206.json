    "body": "Britain is trying to purge the London property market of unsavory owners. Whether or not it succeeds, Russian oligarchs will need new places to launder dirty money.<br />This week, U.K. politicians agreed to set up a register of overseas companies with title to property in Britain. The idea was first raised six years ago during a wave of outrage against corrupt money, but fell by the wayside as Brexit and the pandemic dominated public debate. Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine has bumped the clampdown back up the agenda."
