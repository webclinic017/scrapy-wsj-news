    "body": "Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo feels aggrieved and wants to make a political comeback. He spoke at a church on Sunday and deplored “cancel culture” for driving him out of Albany and for his brother Chris’s firing from CNN.<br />Mr. Cuomo apologized for his behavior toward women that led to investigations and his resignation. But he noted that no formal charges had ever been filed against him. “Any accusation can trigger condemnation without facts, without due process. We’re a nation of laws. We are not a nation of tweets,” he said. “And woe unto us if we allow that to become our new justice system.”"
