    "body": "Australia’s lead management agency for the Great Barrier Reef said widespread coral bleaching has been discovered across the Marine Park.<br />Bleaching, which occurs when water temperatures rise, can kill the corals. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said the current bleaching ranges from minor to severe, with most observations showing paling or fluorescing corals. But it added that whole colonies in several areas have been bleached white."
