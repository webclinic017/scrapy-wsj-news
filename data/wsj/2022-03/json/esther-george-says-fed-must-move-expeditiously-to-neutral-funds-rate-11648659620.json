    "body": "Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Esther George said she supports a swift move by the central bank toward a neutral setting for monetary policy, and added that once that point is reached, officials can take stock of how much further they may need to go in a time of considerable uncertainty.<br />“Given the state of the economy, with inflation at a 40-year high and the unemployment rate near record lows, moving expeditiously to a neutral stance of policy is appropriate,” Ms. George said Wednesday in a virtual appearance. She noted that while there is uncertainty around what level short-term interest rates neither stimulate nor restrain economic activity, she currently estimates the neutral rate to be around 2.5%, well above where the Fed’s interest-rate target now lies."
