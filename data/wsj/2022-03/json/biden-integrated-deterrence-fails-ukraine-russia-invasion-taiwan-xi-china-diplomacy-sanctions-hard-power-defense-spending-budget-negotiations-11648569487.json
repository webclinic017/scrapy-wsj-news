    "body": "Perhaps desperate for a win after their failures in Afghanistan, senior Pentagon officials are bragging to the Washington Post about the success of “integrated deterrence” in Ukraine. This buzzy new phrase serves as the intellectual foundation of President Biden’s forthcoming National Defense Strategy, combining diplomacy, alliances and new technology with conventional hard power to deter bad guys from doing bad things.<br />That may sound reasonable, but the administration’s embrace of integrated deterrence is an abandonment of the Pentagon’s previous strategy of deterrence by denial. That required the U.S. to maintain enough military strength to turn back an adversary’s aggression, particularly in Taiwan and Eastern Europe. In April 2021, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin justified the new approach under the premise that allies and “galloping advances in technology” can pick up the slack."
