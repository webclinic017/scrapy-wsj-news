    "body": "This week, the stock market shut down in Moscow, and Russian shares collapsed on other exchanges, including in London and New York. Exchange-traded funds specializing in Russian stocks are down 90% or more from their highs shortly before the invasion of Ukraine—but, as of Friday, most of them are also frozen.<br />A fact of financial life that most investors have forgotten is that markets aren’t always liquid or continuous. They can dry up, or even die."
