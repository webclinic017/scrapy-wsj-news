    "body": "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has prompted many Western companies across industries to re-evaluate their businesses in Russia. Some have decided to suspend operations in the country, while others have decided to pull out entirely.<br />Companies have flagged concerns about the conflict, worries about the safety of staff and the complications of doing business in the country as Western sanctions increase.While the relatively small size of the Russian economy—and the perceived difficulty of doing business there—means most multinationals have limited exposure to the country, several have built up businesses there."
