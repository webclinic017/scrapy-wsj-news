    "body": "Rachel Carson (1907-1964) is best known for “Silent Spring,” the 1962 book that raised alarm about the dangers of pesticides and is widely credited with launching the modern environmental movement.<br />Carson was a keen compiler of data in making her case, but it was her argument’s eloquence that got attention. The marine biologist—and onetime English major—could capture both the chemical workings of DDT and what it endangered, a world of “alder, viburnum, sweet fern, and juniper, with seasonally changing accents of bright flowers, and of fruits hanging in jewelled clusters in the fall.” Vladimir Nabokov urged his students to exhibit “the passion of a scientist and the precision of a poet,” a lofty ideal a writer like Carson could meet."
