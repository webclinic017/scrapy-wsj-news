    "body": "Pay attention, aspiring shirkers and wannabe buck-passers: This week Congress is giving a master class in pretending to solve a problem while avoiding actual responsibility. The Senate intends to take up bipartisan reform of the U.S. Postal Service. A bill already passed the House, 342-92. The USPS’s real challenge is that the internet was invented. Yet lawmakers can’t stomach retrenchment, so they’ve instead agreed on . . . this.<br />The bill’s biggest item would force postal retirees to sign up for Medicare. About 26% prefer to stay on USPS plans. The postal service says pushing such workers into Medicare isn’t a bailout because the USPS pays the usual Medicare taxes, meaning that if workers never enroll, the current setup “results in an overpayment.” The extra retirees, the USPS adds, would barely dent Medicare’s trust fund: “The impact is just 0.12%, or less than half of one day’s worth of claims per year.” Republican Sen. Rick Scott has offered an amendment to have the post office repay Medicare to make it whole."
