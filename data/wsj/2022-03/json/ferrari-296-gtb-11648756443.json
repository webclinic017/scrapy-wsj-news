    "body": "IT’S CLEAR some oligarchs will be cutting back. May I suggest the new Ferrari 296 GTB, the company’s new mid-engine berlinetta, with a plug-in hybrid V6 powertrain? This delicately beautiful two-seater ($475,000 as tested) has V12-performance like Arby’s has the meats: 0-124 mph in 8 seconds, a top speed of 205 mph. The car’s flexed rear haunches make me feel funny inside.<br />But, owing to its advanced hybrid harness, the mid-mounted 3.0-liter V6 consumes less and pollutes a lot less. Actually, with a nominal all-electric range of 15 miles, this plug-in Ferrari would be welcome even in London’s Zero Emission Zones. If not all its buyers."
