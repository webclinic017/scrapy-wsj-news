    "body": "As Americans grapple with soaring inflation and life after lockdowns, they want more job flexibility and protection of their rights in the workplace.<br />Frustration over classroom closings, reckless spending and how to return to normal highlights a growing divide between blue-state politicians and America’s workers. Some politicians are backing labor policies that benefit government regulators, union bosses and other special-interest groups. It’s time to put workers back in the driver’s seat. This week I’m introducing legislation that protects workers, supports small-business owners and encourages innovation."
