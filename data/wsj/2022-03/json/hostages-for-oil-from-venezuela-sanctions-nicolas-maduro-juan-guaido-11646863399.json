    "body": "Venezuelan strongman Nicolás Maduro released two American captives on Tuesday, and it’s a relief that their long ordeal is over. But the release coincides with U.S. diplomacy that seems aimed at easing U.S. sanctions so the country can increase oil production. This would reward a rogue regime for taking American hostages with little energy benefit.<br />Gustavo Cárdenas and Jorge Alberto Fernández were released after U.S. diplomats met with Mr. Maduro in Caracas on Saturday. Mr. Cárdenas is a member of the Citgo Six, who were arrested in 2017 on a business trip and have endured hellish conditions in prison."
