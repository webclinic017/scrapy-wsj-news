    "body": "Rarely have nine words caused such global consternation as President Joe Biden’s impromptu reference to Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Poland Saturday. Mr. Biden’s declaration that “For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power!” unsettled allies, fed Mr. Putin’s paranoia, buried the president’s intended message, and complicated an already grave situation.<br />Mr. Biden’s blooper is only the latest in a long string of jarring misstatements. He makes them worse with his unwavering denial in the aftermath. For example, his Putin regime-change announcement was preceded on his trip by a presidential threat that if Russia used chemical weapons, America “would trigger a response in kind” (the U.S. doesn’t have such weapons and signed a treaty pledging not to use them) and a suggestion to troops from the 82nd Airborne that they were going to Ukraine (they aren’t). Asked by Fox News’s Peter Doocy about this triple gaffe Monday at a White House rollout of his 2023 budget, the president replied, “None of the three occurred.”"
