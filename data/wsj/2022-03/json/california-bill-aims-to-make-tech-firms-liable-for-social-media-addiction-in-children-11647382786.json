    "body": "A pair of California lawmakers introduced a bill that aims to hold technology companies liable for social-media addictions that may affect children.<br />The bill would let parents and guardians sue platforms that they believe addicted children in their care through advertising, push notifications and design features that promote compulsive use, particularly the continual consumption of harmful content on issues such as eating disorders and suicide."
