    "body": "If astronomers are right, the moon just got another crater.<br />Just before 7:26 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday, a four-ton hunk of space junk careened into the lunar surface at nearly 5,800 miles an hour, analyses of the object’s trajectory indicated. The object, believed to be a spent Chinese rocket booster, was expected to create a 65-foot-wide crater on the moon’s far side."
