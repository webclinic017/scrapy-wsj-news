    "body": "Thank you, Prof. Todd Henderson, for an insightful and timely column regarding the importance of freedom of thought on college campuses (“Free Inquiry Suffers as War Fever Grips Harvard,” op-ed, March 17). This came a day after I read of the shameful demonstration of Yale law students shouting down a speaker and intimidating attendees at a free-speech event on Yale’s campus. It is distressing how illiberal our most esteemed institutions have become.<br />The university administrations do a tremendous disservice to the students by not robustly and vocally quashing such interruptions, just as they smother critical thinking by taking sides in areas of public concern. This is important even when the moral stance is as obvious as that of supporting Ukraine in the current conflict. Civil society will wither at the hands of elites with luxury beliefs who cannot engage respectfully with dissenting thought."
