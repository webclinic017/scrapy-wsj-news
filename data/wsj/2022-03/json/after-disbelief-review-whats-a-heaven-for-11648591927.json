    "body": "Is belief in God tenable after Darwin and Einstein? No, say atheists like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris. Science, without any need to refer to a superior intelligence, can account for both the creation of the universe and the origin of our species. Not so fast, believers like Richard Swinburne and Alvin Plantinga retort. Both the cosmos and human beings are far too complex to have been fashioned by anything other than a supreme being. The battle, begun long ago, rages on.<br />In “After Disbelief,” Anthony Kronman, a former dean of Yale Law School, wants to reconcile the warring sides. He accepts that science has ruled out the existence of the Abrahamic God—a God who occupies a heavenly world above while remaining present to us at “every moment” in time. But what if we think of God in a different way? Though not present to us so far, perhaps God will gradually emerge over time. And though there might not be another realm that he inhabits, perhaps God will become apparent in this world as humankind comes to probe ever more deeply the splendors it contains."
