    "body": "The U.S. and Europe have shown impressive cohesion since Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, which makes this week’s fiasco over delivering Poland’s MiG fighters to Kyiv so damaging. The message to Mr. Putin is that his intimidation works and NATO can be divided.<br />On Tuesday Poland said it could transfer around two dozen MIG-29 jet fighters to a U.S. base in Germany, and then to Ukraine, whose pilots can fly the Soviet-era planes with minimal training. On Sunday Secretary of State Antony Blinken had said the U.S. was working with the Poles on the issue and would try to “backfill anything that they provide to the Ukrainians.” Yet Washington later claimed surprise at Poland’s proposal."
