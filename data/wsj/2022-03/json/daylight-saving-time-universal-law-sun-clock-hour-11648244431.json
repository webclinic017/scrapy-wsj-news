    "body": "Your editorial “Florida Daylight Saving Time” (March 22) says that “all-year standard time would also mean very early sunrises in many states—before 4:30 a.m.” Those sunrises will always occur at 4:30 a.m., no matter what the government may say.<br />Legislating how to read a clock is akin to mandating that winter temperatures ought to be reported as 10 degrees higher to make us feel warmer, or that distances from suburbs to the city be marked as five miles longer to discourage highway congestion. We don’t need the government to try to fool us. Clocks are supposed to tell the time. Let them perform their intended purpose and everyone can decide for themselves if they want to start their days earlier in the summer months."
