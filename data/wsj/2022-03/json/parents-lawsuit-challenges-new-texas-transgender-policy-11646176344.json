    "body": "The parents of a 16-year-old transgender Texas girl filed a lawsuit Tuesday challenging a new state policy directing child-protection officials to investigate whether transgender youth receiving hormone blockers and other treatments are being subjected to child abuse.<br />The plaintiffs, who brought the case under pseudonyms to protect their privacy, allege the state already is investigating them after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued a directive last week outlining the new policy. The parents said their daughter was receiving medical treatment for gender dysphoria. She was deemed male at birth but now identifies as female and has been receiving medication to delay the onset of puberty among other effects."
