    "body": "So much for President Biden’s pivot to the political middle. The fiscal 2023 budget he unveiled Monday re-proposes most of the bad ideas that haven’t passed Congress and adds a new one—a tax on wealth that he refused to endorse as a candidate in 2020. On the economy, he’s pivoting further left—presumably to fire up sullen progressives in November.<br />The White House is proposing a new “billionaire minimum income tax,” which the Federal Trade Commission would call false advertising if a private company tried that description. The tax isn’t limited to billionaires and it applies to more than income."
