    "body": "To Jay Newman’s pessimism regarding the repayment of Russian debt obligations (“If Putin Owes You Money, Good Luck Collecting It,” op-ed, March 10), I offer a modest note of optimism.<br />In the 1890s, my great-grandparents, along with thousands of their fellow French citizens, invested heavily in Russian Czarist bonds. In 1917 the Russian Revolution began and the Soviet government defaulted on those bonds. When I inherited some of the bonds on the death of my grandparents in the 1970s, I was told that their only value was as wall decorations. But I held on to the bonds."
