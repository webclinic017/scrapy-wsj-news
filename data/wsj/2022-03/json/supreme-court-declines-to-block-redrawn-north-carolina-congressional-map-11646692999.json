    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Monday declined to reinstate a congressional map drawn by North Carolina’s Republican-controlled Legislature, after the state’s highest court threw out the plan as a partisan gerrymander.<br />The majority, as is customary in such emergency orders, provided no reasoning for its ruling. Three conservative justices dissented from Monday’s order, arguing the court should restore the Legislature’s map and then consider whether the federal Constitution prevents state courts from reviewing congressional redistricting decisions made by state lawmakers."
