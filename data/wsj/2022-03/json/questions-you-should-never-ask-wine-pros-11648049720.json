    "body": "SOMMELIERS ARE accustomed to answering the same questions over and over again. Can you recommend a good Pinot Noir? A wine under $50? A wine that goes with both chicken and fish? While they’re generally happy to field any inquiry, some are thornier than others, requiring not only knowledge but tact and diplomacy. I asked seven top sommeliers to share the questions they most dread hearing—and how they turn a potentially problematic encounter into a happy event.<br />Rick Arline, beverage director of Girl & the Goat in Chicago, hears this one a lot. If someone asks this question, Mr. Arline might answer, “Everything is good. That’s why it’s here.” And he’s likely to follow up with a few questions of his own, to find out what kinds of wines the customer likes. Red or white, full-bodied or light? He might suggest the diner start with a sparkling wine—like the rosé of Raventós from Penedès, Spain, that he features by the glass—as they consider their options."
