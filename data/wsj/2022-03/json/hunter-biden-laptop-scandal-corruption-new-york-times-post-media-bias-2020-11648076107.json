    "body": "Regarding Gerard Baker’s “Hunter Biden’s Laptop and America’s Crisis of Accountability” (Free Expression, March 22): The media excuse that it ignored the laptop because of ”uncertainty about its provenance” is hogwash. We all know that if a similar story had emerged about the Trump family, even with no credible source, the mainstream media would have run it nonstop.<br />There was no question about the validity of the story, which was verified by Tony Bobulinski. The coverage by the New York Post was extensive and believable. The Biden family never even denied the story—it merely refused to discuss it and the press allowed it to dodge the issue."
