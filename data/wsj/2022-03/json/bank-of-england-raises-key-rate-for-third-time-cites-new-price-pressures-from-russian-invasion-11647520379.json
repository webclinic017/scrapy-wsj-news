    "body": "The Bank of England raised its key interest rate for the third time in as many policy meetings Thursday, a fresh sign that central banks in many parts of the world are giving priority to countering a surge in inflation rather than slowing growth as their economies brace for the negative impact of Russia’s war on Ukraine.<br />The BOE’s decision came a day after the Federal Reserve announced its first rate rise since 2018, penciling in six more increases by year’s end, and was made for similar reasons."
