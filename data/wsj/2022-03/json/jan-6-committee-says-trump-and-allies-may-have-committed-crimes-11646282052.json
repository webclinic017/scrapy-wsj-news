    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol said in a court filing Wednesday that President Donald Trump and some of his allies might have committed crimes by seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.<br />The filing came as part of legal proceedings over the testimony of John Eastman, a lawyer and professor at Chapman University who advanced a fringe legal theory after Mr. Trump’s loss to Joe Biden. Mr. Eastman claimed that Vice President Mike Pence could stop certification of the election on Jan. 6, 2021, as part of his ceremonial role as vice president. The panel’s immediate aim with the filing was to force Mr. Eastman to hand over thousands of pages of emails that he is suing to withhold."
