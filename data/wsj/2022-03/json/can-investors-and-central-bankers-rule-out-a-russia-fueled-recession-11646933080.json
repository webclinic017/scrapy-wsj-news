    "body": "When not even a war deters central banks from tightening monetary policy, investors should know they are on perilous ground.<br />On Thursday, the European Central Bank said it would scale down its bond buying faster than previously planned, opening the door to interest-rate increases later this year, even though its president, Christine Lagarde, admitted that “economic activity could be dampened significantly” by the war in Ukraine.
