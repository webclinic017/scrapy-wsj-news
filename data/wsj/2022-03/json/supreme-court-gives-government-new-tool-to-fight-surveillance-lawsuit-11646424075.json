    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court Friday cleared the way for the government to argue that national security could be endangered if lower courts allowed a group of American Muslims to proceed with a lawsuit alleging the FBI targeted them for surveillance because of their religion.<br />The unanimous opinion left it to lower courts to decide if the government’s “state secrets” claim was enough to quash the case, which stems from a 2006 undercover operation that sent a bodybuilder to infiltrate an Irvine, Calif., mosque in a futile effort to find terrorists."
