    "body": "Alan Blinder defends Sarah Bloom Raskin’s nomination for the Federal Reserve’s vice chair of supervision (“Sarah Bloom Raskin Belongs at the Fed,” March 3). Surprising for an economist of Mr. Blinder’s caliber, his argument is quite weak.<br />To begin, Mr. Blinder assumes facts not in evidence. He incredulously asks, “Does anyone doubt” climate change poses a major risk to the financial system? Actually, yes. A great many economists doubt it. There is no scientific consensus that the effects of climate change, such as extreme weather or natural disasters, cause financial crises. Strike one."
