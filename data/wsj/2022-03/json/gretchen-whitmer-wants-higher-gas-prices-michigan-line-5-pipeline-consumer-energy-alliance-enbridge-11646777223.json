    "body": "Americans are already paying an average of $4 for a gallon of gasoline these days. And if Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer succeeds in shutting down  Enbridge ’s  Line 5 pipeline, consumers will pay even more in the Midwest.<br />Ms. Whitmer is fighting Enbridge in state and federal court with the goal of compelling the closure of Line 5, a crucial pipeline carrying fossil fuels between Canada and several U.S. states. Her campaign is contrary to a U.S. treaty with Canada, not that she seems to care."
