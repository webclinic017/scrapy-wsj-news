    "body": "WASHINGTON—House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said that he would remove House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) from that panel if Republicans win control of the House in this year’s elections.<br />“Why is he still chair of the committee and why is he even on the committee?” said Mr. McCarthy, who is the front-runner to be House speaker if Republicans win the majority. “In a new Congress, if it’s a new majority, he will not be. You cannot make this committee political.”"
