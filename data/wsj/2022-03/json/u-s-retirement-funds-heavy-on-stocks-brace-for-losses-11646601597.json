    "body": "Volatile stock markets are eroding the retirement savings of Americaâ€™s teachers and firefighters after public pension systems ended last year with equity holdings at a 10-year high.<br />Public pension funds had a median 61% of their assets in stocks as of Dec. 31, up from 54% 10 years ago, according to Wilshire Trust Universe Comparison Service.
