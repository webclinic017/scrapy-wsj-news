    "body": "William Galston concludes “Our Moral Obligation to Ukraine” (Politics & Ideas, March 16) by saying that “we should be able to tell ourselves that we did everything that could reasonably be expected of us, short of risking war with a nuclear-armed aggressor, to prevent this outcome.”<br />Actually, we all but invited Vladimir Putin to invade.
