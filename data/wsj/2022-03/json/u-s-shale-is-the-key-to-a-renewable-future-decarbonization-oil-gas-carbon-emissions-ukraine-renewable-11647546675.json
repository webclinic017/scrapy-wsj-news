    "body": "A proper price for oil and gas would allow investors to earn returns on their capital while also accounting for the effect carbon emissions have on the planet. The damage from fossil fuels is real, and suppliers and users alike should share in that cost.<br />Reliance on gas and oil for our energy needs is unsustainable, both environmentally and geopolitically. We need to align energy use and development of domestic fossil fuels, nuclear power and renewable energy with the broader societal goal of decarbonization. To get there, we need a practical framework for the oil-and-gas sector to approach an energy transition."
