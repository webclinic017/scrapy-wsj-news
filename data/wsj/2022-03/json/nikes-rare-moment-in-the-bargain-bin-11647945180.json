    "body": "Between inventory snags, inflation and a soured customer base in China,  Nike  faced some obstacles last quarter. It dashed right past them.<br />The sneakers giant sold 8% more in its third quarter ended Feb. 28 compared with a year earlier on a constant-currency basis, the company reported on Monday evening. That was much better than the 3.5% growth that analysts polled by Visible Alpha had been expecting."
