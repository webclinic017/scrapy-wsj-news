    "body": "SEOUL—North Korea has started construction at its main nuclear-testing facility for the first time in nearly four years, new satellite imagery shows, following a recent suggestion by Pyongyang that it could return to major weapons launches.<br />Newly detected activity at the Punggye-ri test site—where all six of North Korea’s nuclear tests to date have occurred—include construction of a new building and possible repairs to another, according to researchers at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies who studied images taken Friday by  Maxar Technologies .  The images also showed other possible signs of continuing work, from suspected piles of lumber to sawdust, the researchers added."
