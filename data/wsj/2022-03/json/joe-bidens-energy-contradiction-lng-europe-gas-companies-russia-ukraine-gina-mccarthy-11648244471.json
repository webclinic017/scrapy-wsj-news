    "body": "The good news is that the U.S. finally agreed Friday to help Europe replace Russia as its main natural gas supplier. The bad news is that President Biden is still telling U.S. gas producers he wants to put them out of business.<br />It sounds crazy, but listen to Mr. Biden’s remarks Friday. “We’re going to have to make sure the families in Europe can get through this winter and the next,” he said in announcing the deal to provide 15 billion cubic meters of gas this year, though not all from the U.S."
