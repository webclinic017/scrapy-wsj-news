    "body": "Bernie Sanders may have lost his bid to raise taxes as part of the Build Back Better plan, but Bernie never sleeps and he suddenly sees a new socialist opportunity in war. Behold his “Ending Corporate Greed Act,” which would impose a 95% tax on U.S. corporate “excess” profits.<br />“We cannot allow big oil companies and other large, profitable corporations to continue to use the war in Ukraine, the Covid-19 pandemic and the specter of inflation to make obscene profits—by price-gouging Americans at the gas pump, the grocery store or any other sector of our economy,” the Vermont Senator said Friday."
