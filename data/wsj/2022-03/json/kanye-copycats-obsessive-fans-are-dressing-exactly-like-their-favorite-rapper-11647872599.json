    "body": "Josh Dunn, a 24-year-old business assistant in Chesterfield, England, is obviously not Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West. But that doesn’t stop the amiable Brit from dressing exactly like the 44-year-old rapper, clothing designer and cultural agitator.<br />One day, it’s a dusty workwear jacket with a dingy black hoodie and hulking Balenciaga Croc boots. Another, it’s a glossy leather jacket, a scooped-neck shirt and those beefy boots again. Over the past two or so years, Mr. Dunn (also a fan of Ye’s music) has become a master at echoing the rapper’s distinct style: part oil-rigger, part leather-daddy, part “Rollerball”-background-character."
