    "body": "Solar-power company  Altus Power Inc.  and commercial real-estate developer  Trammell Crow Co.  have reached a deal to install solar panels on 35 million square feet of U.S. industrial property, the latest sign that sustainability is becoming a growing concern of commercial property owners.<br />Altus will install solar panels on properties in Trammell’s development pipeline at a cost of $600 million, and make further investments in battery-storage capacity, electric-vehicle charging stations and other environmentally friendly technologies, said Co-Chief Executive Lars Norell. Altus will then sell the clean power that it generates, mostly to Trammell’s tenants, at a discount from the grid price."
