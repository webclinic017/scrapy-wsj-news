    "body": "It’s one thing to invade a country. Even decapitating a government can be relatively easy, although Vladimir Putin has so far failed in Ukraine. But it’s something else entirely to pacify a country and occupy it over time toward a favorable conclusion. The Soviet Union found that out in Afghanistan after 1979 and the U.S. in Iraq after 2003—the two largest ground invasions in the past half-century.<br />What lessons can Mr. Putin, and the Western leaders contending with him on the international stage, draw from history? Each invasion was followed by a lengthy, bloody and complex conflict. Afghanistan was a clear loss for the Soviets, and Iraq for the U.S. was something between a draw and an overpriced win. The lessons from these cases shouldn’t be heartening to the Kremlin today."
