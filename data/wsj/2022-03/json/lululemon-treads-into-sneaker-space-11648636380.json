    "body": "Leggings leader  Lululemon  is stepping into the women’s footwear category. Is it getting into it for the right reasons?<br />Similar to other athletic apparel brands—including Nike and Adidas—Lululemon shares have lost ground this year as investors fretted about supply-chain issues and possible damping in consumer demand as inflation pushes up the cost of everything. Nevertheless, Lululemon’s announcement of a women’s sneakers launch earlier in March seemed to have gotten investors excited. Its shares have risen 7.5% over the past month, outperforming  Nike  and Adidas, which are each up about 2%."
