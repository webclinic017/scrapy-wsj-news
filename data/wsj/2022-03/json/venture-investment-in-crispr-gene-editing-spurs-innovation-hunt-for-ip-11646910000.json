    "body": "Increasing venture-capital investment in gene-editing technology is fueling a rush to secure intellectual property in a sector that promises to spur advances across several areas of biotechnology.<br />Technology known as Crispr enables researchers to make precise changes, or edits, to the genetic code, which could lead to therapies for genetic diseases, cancer and other conditions. Because of its broad commercial potential, the gene-editing technology has been surrounded by intellectual-property disputes for several years."
