    "body": "Is China finally opening up? The mere whisper of a plan to do so could be good news for companies relying on Chinese consumers and travelers. Such whispers are now beginning to percolate out of the Middle Kingdom, which has remained essentially closed to the outside world for the past two years.<br />That is undeniably bullish news for China’s long-suffering consumer stocks. But the road to reopening is likely to be a rocky one. Buying in now on the cheap might pay dividends over the long run, but investors had better have a strong stomach for volatility."
