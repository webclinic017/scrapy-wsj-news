    "body": "Can a politician bungle a nation’s response to Covid and remain widely popular? Yes, going by recent election results in India. Last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party won comfortably in four of the five states that voted recently. In Uttar Pradesh, whose 230 million people make it India’s largest and most politically significant state, the BJP government is the first of any party to win re-election in nearly 40 years.<br />The results place the BJP in position to retain power in national elections in 2024. Uttar Pradesh’s controversial chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, a hard-line Hindu nationalist known outside India primarily for his anti-Muslim rhetoric, is a strong contender to succeed Mr. Modi as party leader. The elections mark the continued slide to irrelevance of the once-dominant Congress Party, which lost in all five states, and the growth of the upstart anticorruption Aam Aadmi Party, which wrested the agrarian state of Punjab from Congress. But most of all the results underscore Mr. Modi’s continued appeal to voters in the populous Hindi heartland."
