    "body": "I am about to go where many, many style writers have gone before: I am going to attempt to answer the question of whether or not a man can tuck a sweater into his pants. Give this philosophical query a quick google and you’ll find articles dating from the early 1990s in publications both predictable (GQ Magazine) and unexpected (the Orlando Sentinel), all tackling the “to tuck or not to tuck” dilemma. But the quandary remains unsettled, without a true agreed-upon answer.<br />The question popped up again late last year in an episode of “Curb Your Enthusiasm” in which the show’s central fusspot, Larry David, comments on another man’s decision to wedge his sweater into his chinos. “This is interesting,” Mr. David says, pointing at the pristine tuck. “Who started you with that? Your mother?” So fixated is Mr. David on this tuckery that he tries it himself in the next scene, spurring an onlooker to echo his curmudgeonly confusion: “Why is he tucking his sweater into his pants? Who does that?”"
