    "body": "The world is rightly focused on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but don’t sit on the Indo-Pacific. A spate of bad news outside Europe this week is a reminder that the U.S. and its allies face challenges from authoritarian regimes on multiple fronts.<br />North Korea on Thursday fired an intercontinental ballistic missile, its 12th missile test this year. The first ICBM launched since November 2017, it flew higher than any North Korean missile has. The missile landed in waters off Japan’s western coast, but the test demonstrates again that Pyongyang could threaten the U.S. mainland."
