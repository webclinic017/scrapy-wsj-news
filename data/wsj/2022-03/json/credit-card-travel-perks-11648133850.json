One escape route from that unpleasantness may lie in the credit card you use to book your trip. Cards with the richest benefits carry hefty annual fees ($400 or more on the priciest options) but with access to airline clubs and hotel upgrades, you could earn that back after a few trips. Here, some of the better ways you can put your plastic to work while on the road:<br />Lounge access—complete with free food and drink and a quiet seat away from the masses—is “the ultimate ‘Champagne-on-a-beer budget’ perk,” said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate.com. The major travel-friendly credit cards—including Chase Sapphire Reserve, American Express Platinum and Capital One Venture X Rewards—grant you membership in Priority Pass, a network of more than a thousand clubs at airports around the world.  Amex ’s  card does one better: It admits you to the Priority Pass lounges as well as the company’s own growing network of Centurion Clubs, plus some Delta and  Lufthansa  lounges; Chase and Capital One are also opening their own bespoke clubs for their travel cardholders."
