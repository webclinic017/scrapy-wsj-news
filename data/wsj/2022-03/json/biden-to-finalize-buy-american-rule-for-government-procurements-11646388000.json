    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Biden administration is expected to complete rules that would speed up federal procurement policies to require a higher level of American-made products.<br />The new requirements, which President Biden is set to highlight during an event Friday at the White House, will mean that products obtained under the “Buy American” program will need to have at least 60% of the value of components made in the U.S., up from the current threshold of 55%. The rules will increase that standard to 65% in 2024 and 75% by 2029, the White House said."
