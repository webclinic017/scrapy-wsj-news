    "body": "BOSTONâ€”The sprawling college admissions cheating scandal that resulted in 50 guilty pleas over nearly three years will tie up one of its last loose ends this week: Acclaimed water polo coach Jovan Vavic is scheduled to go to trial on charges he took bribes in exchange for tagging applicants as recruited athletes.<br />The trial is likely to provide another glimpse at how the largest education scam ever prosecuted by the Justice Department exploited low-profile college sports and the special advantage given to athletes in the admissions process. The trial, which is expected to last about four weeks, will also put a spotlight on the inner workings of the University of Southern California, where prosecutors said the fraud ran particularly deep."
