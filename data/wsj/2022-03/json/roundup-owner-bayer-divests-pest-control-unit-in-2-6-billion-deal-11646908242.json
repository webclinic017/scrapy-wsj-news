    "body": "BERLINâ€” Bayer AG  agreed to sell its pest-control unit to private-equity firm Cinven for $2.6 billion, as the German chemical and drug giant seeks to focus on its core agricultural portfolio and reduce debt.<br />Environmental Science Professional, a U.S.-based unit of the company, sells pesticides and rodent control to non-farming customers such as warehouses and golf courses. Bayer announced last year its intention to unload the unit, which had around 1 billion euros, equivalent to $1.1 billion, in sales in 2021."
