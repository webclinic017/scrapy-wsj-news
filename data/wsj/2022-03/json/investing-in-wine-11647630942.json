    "body": "WHEN MY FRIEND Jeff began collecting great wine in the 1980s, he did it because he loved wine. By 2011 Jeff knew he’d never drink it all, and he sold most of his cellar at auction for $3.6 million. In Jeff’s view, the auction proceeds “paid for all the drinking” he’d done over the years.<br />The money Jeff made was a byproduct of his passion, not an end in itself. Lately, however, I’ve been receiving email offers stressing the fiscal rewards of investing in wine. My social media feed, too, has been rife with offers. One sponsored post on  Facebook ,  from the wine investment platform Vinovest, urged: “Beat stock volatility with wine investing.”"
