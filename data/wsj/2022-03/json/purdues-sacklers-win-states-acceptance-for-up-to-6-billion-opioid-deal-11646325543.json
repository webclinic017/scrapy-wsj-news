    "body": "Members of the Sackler family who own Purdue Pharma LP and grew wealthy from sales of OxyContin agreed to pay up to $6 billion to settle lawsuits accusing them of helping fuel the opioid-addiction epidemic, earning the unanimous support of state attorneys general to resolve the family’s liability and end the drugmaker’s bankruptcy case.<br />The new settlement unveiled Thursday marks an increase from the $4.5 billion previously offered by the Sacklers, whose wealth has been estimated at roughly $11 billion. For the first time, the proposed deal has the support of a key group of state attorneys general who had opposed Purdue’s earlier efforts to resolve opioid-related liability, saying the Sacklers weren’t paying enough to fight opioid addiction and deter corporate wrongdoing."
