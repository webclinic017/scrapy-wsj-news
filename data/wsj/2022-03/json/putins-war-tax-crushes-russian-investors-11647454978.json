    "body": "Call him Vlad the Investment Impaler. Russian bonds have collapsed in value since Vladimir Putin’s vicious invasion of Ukraine, and Russian stocks still aren’t allowed to trade for fear they would reveal a monumental loss of wealth. A sharp decline in the country’s GDP is nearly certain this year, and it all adds up to a massive confiscatory war tax that Mr. Putin is imposing on the Russian people. This raises the question of just how long he can sustain his costly and destructive assault on Ukraine.<br />As for the U.S., while helping Ukraine and carefully avoiding being drawn into war, policy makers should also be prepared  for the day when it’s time to help Russia peacefully navigate the post-Putin era."
