    "body": "Los Angeles<br />With “Delirious New York: A Retrospective Manifesto for Manhattan” (1978), an exceptionally well-timed book, Rem Koolhaas made himself a famous architect before he had built a single building. It celebrated just those aspects of the city that the modern movement had tried to suppress—congestion, visual disorder, the joys of sensory overload—and at just the moment when the modern movement was teetering. For a young architect at that time, to be freed from the burden of reforming the city was a liberation. Mr. Koolhaas founded his firm OMA (Office for Metropolitan Architecture) around this central insight: Architecture should concern itself not with ideas but images. The wonder is that it took so long to bring OMA to Los Angeles."
