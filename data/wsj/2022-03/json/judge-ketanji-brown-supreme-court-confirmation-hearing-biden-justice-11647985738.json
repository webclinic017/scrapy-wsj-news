    "body": "Regarding Jason Riley’s “What Kind of Justice Will We Get With Ketanji Brown Jackson?” (Upward Mobility, March 9): My fervent hope for Judge Jackson’s confirmation hearing is that Republicans will read President Biden’s words from 1991 on the qualifications of Justice Clarence Thomas. Then-Sen. Biden said, “Had Thomas been white, he never would have been nominated. The only reason he’s on the court is because he’s black.”<br />Republicans should let Ms. Jackson know that they have no intention of making the same demeaning statement. But they should also ask Judge Jackson what she thinks of those words, coming from the guy who nominated her to the Supreme Court. It would be enlightening to hear what she has to say."
