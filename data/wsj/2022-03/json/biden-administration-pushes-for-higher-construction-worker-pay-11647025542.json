    "body": "The Biden administration is proposing changes designed to push up wages for workers at federally-funded construction projects such as interstates.<br />The proposal would rewrite the rules around the Davis-Bacon Act, a 90-year-old law that applies to government contractors, in an attempt to better account for the increased earnings of construction workers over time, officials said. Many of the changes would alter a 1983 overhaul, enacted under the Reagan administration."
