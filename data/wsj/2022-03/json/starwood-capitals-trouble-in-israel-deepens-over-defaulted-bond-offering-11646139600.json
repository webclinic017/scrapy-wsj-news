    "body": "Israel’s securities regulator said it would financially support a class-action suit involving a soured Starwood Capital Group bond deal, a move that comes as that country’s once-popular debt market with U.S. real-estate investors is getting tougher on some foreign companies.<br />The lawsuit, filed in 2019, alleges that Starwood misrepresented and omitted some risks in the prospectus for a bond offering of 910 million shekels ($281 million), which was backed by a group of U.S. malls. The lawsuit alleges that there was insufficient disclosure about lease covenants and ratings on loans connected to some of the underlying assets."
