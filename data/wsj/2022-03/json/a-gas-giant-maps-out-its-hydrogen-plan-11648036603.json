    "body": "Air Liquide  shows what a big hydrogen company looks like now. Maintaining its position as the gas becomes a key fuel for decarbonizing the global economy could be tough, but there is time to figure it out.<br />The company sells about €2 billion, equivalent to $2.2 billion, worth of the clean-burning fuel annually, primarily to oil refiners and fertilizer makers, roughly a 10th of its 2021 revenues. The Paris-listed company, which launched a new strategy on Tuesday, is one of three global experts in producing and transporting industrial gases, alongside  Linde  and  Air Products and Chemicals .  For price-to-book ratios of around three—modest for stocks with hydrogen links—they offer investors a piece of the clean-gas opportunity coupled with proven business models that have weathered the past two years profitably."
