    "body": "As Ukrainians search the rubble for the dead in a theater that had sheltered children in the besieged city of Mariupol, U.S. officials have begun to call Vladimir Putin a “war criminal.” If they mean it, the label carries serious implications for when or even whether the U.S. can lift sanctions on Russia.<br />President Biden called Mr. Putin a war criminal on Wednesday, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken elaborated Thursday. “Personally, I agree [with the President]. Intentionally targeting civilians is a war crime,” Mr. Blinken said at the State Department. “After all the destruction of the past three weeks, I find it difficult to conclude that the Russians are doing otherwise.”"
