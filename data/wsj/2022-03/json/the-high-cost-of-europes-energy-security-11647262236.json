    "body": "Europe’s ambitious plan to cut its reliance on Russian gas by two-thirds this year just might work. But it will come at a price—economically or environmentally.<br />The European Union is expected to release another round of sanctions this week covering industries such as steel and luxury goods, but the kind of bans on Russian energy introduced by the U.S. and U.K. aren’t on the table. The bloc’s road map to end its dependence on Russian fuels by 2027 already gives it plenty to do."
