    "body": "A consortium of environmental groups launched a campaign on Monday seeking to change bitcoin’s code to decrease its energy use, which has grown substantially in the past few years.<br />Bitcoin is popular among some investors, but its energy use has riled environmental groups, alarmed some lawmakers, and put the cryptocurrency at odds with a green movement that has some supporters on Wall Street. The new campaign aims to persuade people involved with the cryptocurrency, from mining companies to investors to software developers, that a change is better for the environment and bitcoin’s reputation and support."
