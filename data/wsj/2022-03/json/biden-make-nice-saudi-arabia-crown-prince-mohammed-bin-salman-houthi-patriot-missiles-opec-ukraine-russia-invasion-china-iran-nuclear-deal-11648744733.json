    "body": "Riyadh, Saudi Arabia<br />Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting and reflection, begins this weekend.

This might be a propitious moment for President Biden to visit the kingdom and seek forgiveness for a growing list of Saudi grievances that have badly damaged relations between Washington and Riyadh. Notably, the kingdomâ€™s de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is refusing to pump more oil to help Mr. Biden in his quest to lower energy prices."
