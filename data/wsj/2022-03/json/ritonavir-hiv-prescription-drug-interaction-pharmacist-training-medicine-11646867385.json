    "body": "Henry Miller’s op-ed doubting pharmacists’ ability to recognize drug interactions involving ritonavir (“Biden’s Half-Baked Covid Treatment Plan,” March 4) betrays a view of pharmacists that is decades out of date.<br />Pharmacy curricula long ago transited from educating chemists to educating practitioners who collaborate with physicians and make or recommend clinical decisions. Drug interactions are a major focus, and pharmacists’ knowledge here is often greater than that of other health professionals."
