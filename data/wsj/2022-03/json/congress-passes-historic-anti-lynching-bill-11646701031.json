    "body": "WASHINGTON—After more than 100 years of effort and 200 bills that failed, legislation to designate lynching a federal hate crime passed Congress on Monday and will head to President Biden for a signature.<br />The measure passed the Senate by unanimous consent, meaning none of the 100 senators objected. It cleared the House last month in a 422—3 vote."
