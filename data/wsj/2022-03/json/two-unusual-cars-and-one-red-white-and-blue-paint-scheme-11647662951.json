    "body": "Dave Battle, 57, an insurance agent living in Santa Clarita, Calif., on his 1970 AMC Rebel Machine and 2017 Dodge Viper Dealer Edition ACR, as told to A.J. Baime.<br />I have always been into unique, special-edition cars. I had seen pictures of this AMC Rebel Machine from 1970 in a red, white and blue paint scheme. Founded in the 1950s, AMC was for years a big independent car manufacturer, and its name stood for American Motors Corp. Red, white and blue were the corporate colors, and only in 1970 did the company put out the Rebel Machine with this paint scheme."
