    "body": "In “On Ukraine, History is Listening” (Declarations, March 19), Peggy Noonan captures much that is true in her typical articulate way, but I do have two quibbles. First, in the way of Washington insiders, she assumes there is a right side of history. Not so. History has no moral component. It is written by the winners.<br />Second, Ms. Noonan asserts that we must be guided above all else by a strategy that avoids provoking Vladimir Putin to use his most terrible weapons—the “avoid Armageddon at all costs” strategy. We certainly want to avoid Armageddon, but how best to achieve that? I submit that projecting fear of an opponent is seldom, if ever, the best way to avoid the consequences we fear. Mr. Putin has every bit as much to fear from us as we do from him. At least in private, we should assure Mr. Putin that his use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons in Ukraine would cross a red line that would provoke us to respond militarily. And unlike former President Barack Obama, we must mean it."
