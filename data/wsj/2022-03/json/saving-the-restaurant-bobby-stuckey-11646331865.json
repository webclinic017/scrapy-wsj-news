    "body": "“I GOT IT. White Corolla.” And with that, a masked Bobby Stuckey bounds out the front door of his restaurant Frasca Food and Wine in Boulder, Colo., carrying a white paper takeout bag and a wine bottle to the waiting vehicle.<br />This scene takes place 16 minutes into a new documentary, now streaming on SOMM TV, called “Saving the Restaurant.” The film chronicles Mr. Stuckey’s part in a nationwide effort to do just that, as well as the various ways in which he and his staff have had to rethink their day-to-day operations in order to survive."
