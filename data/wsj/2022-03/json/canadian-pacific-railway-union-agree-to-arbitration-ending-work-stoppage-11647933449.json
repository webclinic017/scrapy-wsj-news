    "body": "Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd.  and the union representing its conductors and engineers agreed to shift stalled contract negotiations to binding arbitration, freeing the railway to resume freight shipments after a two-day work stoppage.<br />The agreement follows six months of contract negotiations and mediation with the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference, which represents more than 3,000 conductors, engineers and yard workers at the railway. The union, which seeks increased wages and pension benefits and more rest times, ceased negotiations before its strike deadline Saturday night, prompting the railway to halt shipments of large volumes of manufacturing goods, natural resources and agricultural products."
