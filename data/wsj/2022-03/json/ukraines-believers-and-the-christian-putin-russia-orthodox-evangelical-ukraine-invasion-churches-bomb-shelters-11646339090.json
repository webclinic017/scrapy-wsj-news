    "body": "Pastor Sergey Perkhalskiy made sure to convert his Christian Hope Church in Kyiv to a bomb shelter before quitting the capital last week. He faced a tough choice: stay with his congregation or leave to protect his family, including his elderly parents. Either way, he says, “we overcome fear by helping each other.” Mr. Perkhalskiy’s church is Pentecostal. Like many Protestant clergy, he knows today’s trauma is a foretaste of tomorrow’s wreckage should Vladimir Putin conquer Ukraine.<br />Protestant churches have proliferated by the hundreds since Ukraine gained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. In recent years, however, Moscow operatives have steadily increased their harassment and intimidation tactics against these congregations. The results: church properties seized, clergy tortured and killed."
