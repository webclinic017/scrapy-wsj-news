    "body": "Puerto Rico’s governor axed an $8.3 billion debt-restructuring agreement for the U.S. territory’s bankrupt public power utility, reflecting a lack of political support for raising electricity rates to pay off bondholders.<br />Gov. Pedro Pierluisi said Tuesday that he would terminate a debt-cutting agreement backed by BlackRock Financial Management Inc., Nuveen Asset Management LLC and other creditors of the bankrupt utility, further delaying a restructuring process that began in 2014."
