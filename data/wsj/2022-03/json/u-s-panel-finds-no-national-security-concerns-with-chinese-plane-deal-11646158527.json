    "body": "A U.S. investment-screening panel has concluded its review of a Chinese firm’s nearly 47% stake in a U.S. aircraft startup, determining there are “no unresolved national security concerns” with the deal, according to a letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br />The decision by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., an interagency panel that can recommend the president block or unwind deals on national-security grounds, marks the end of one part of a bitter saga involving feuding American and Chinese investors in Icon Aircraft Inc., a California-based maker of recreational amphibious planes. The outcome is also notable given how carefully Cfius has been scrutinizing Chinese investment in U.S. technology in recent years."
