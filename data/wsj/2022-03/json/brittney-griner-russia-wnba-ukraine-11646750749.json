    "body": "At the ominous moment when Russian troops waited on the Ukrainian border days before their invasion, Brittney Griner flew back to Moscow in February for the same reason the best American women’s basketball players spend half the year working in autocracies: because that’s where the money is.<br />The market for talent lures stars to Russia, where they can command more than $1 million in salary and benefits, 10 times what they have traditionally made in the WNBA. Since 2014, Griner has left the warmth of Phoenix in the WNBA offseason for the cold of Yekaterinburg, a city on the edge of Siberia where the powerhouse team wins championships and pays lavishly."
