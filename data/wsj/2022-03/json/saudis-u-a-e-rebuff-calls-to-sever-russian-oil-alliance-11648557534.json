    "body": "Two influential OPEC members, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, rebuffed calls to expel Russia from a larger oil-production alliance with almost two dozen countries, saying the group had a long history of working together through armed conflicts.<br />A partnership, dubbed OPEC+, between the Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia, has refused to pump more oil at a time when oil prices have rocketed above $100 a barrel. Producing more crude could bring prices down, some analysts say."
