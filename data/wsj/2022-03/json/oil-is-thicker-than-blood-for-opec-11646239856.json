    "body": "When even Switzerland feels compelled to act then you know it is hard to remain neutral about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But Saudi Arabia and the oil cartel it leads are willing to walk that diplomatic tightrope for now. Its oil-stained path will become slippery over time.<br />Wednesday the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its Russia-led allies quickly decided to maintain their existing plans for increasing collective oil output by 400,000 barrels a day for April. That is despite oil prices surging in recent days; after the OPEC+ meeting Brent oil futures rose further to $113 a barrel, the highest in nine years. Crude is now up by about 45% year to date. In a press release, the group said current oil market fundamentals point to a “well-balanced market” and that the volatility today is caused not by market fundamentals but geopolitical developments."
