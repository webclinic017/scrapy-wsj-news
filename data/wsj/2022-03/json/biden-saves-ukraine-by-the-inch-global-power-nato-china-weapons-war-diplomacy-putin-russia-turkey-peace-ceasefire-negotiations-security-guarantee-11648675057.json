    "body": "President Biden may have made up the line about removing Vladimir Putin from power, but his intense, shouted assertion that we will defend “every inch” of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is in the official text: “Don’t even think about moving on one single inch of NATO territory. We have a sacred obligation under Article 5 to defend each and every inch of NATO territory with the full force of our collective power.”<br />It’s hard to know what that means. Presumably it means that if Russia’s army commits any atrocity on the non-NATO side of various borders—say, gassing Ukraine or Sweden—Article 5 remains dormant. But if a Russian boot or tank tread touches Poland or Latvia, it’s war."
