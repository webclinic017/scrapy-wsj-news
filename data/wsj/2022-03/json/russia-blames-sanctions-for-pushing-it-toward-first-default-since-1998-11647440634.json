    "body": "Russia’s finance minister said the country paid what it owed on its foreign debts on Wednesday but wasn’t sure if the payments would go through, blaming U.S. sanctions for setting the country on the path toward default.<br />The Russian government is required to pay $117 million in interest payments on two dollar-denominated government bonds Wednesday. Failure to pay, or attempting to pay in rubles instead of dollars as required by the bonds, would set the stage for Russia to be placed in default by its creditors."
