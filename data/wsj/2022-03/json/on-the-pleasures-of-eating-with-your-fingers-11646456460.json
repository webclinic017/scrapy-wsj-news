    "body": "It was dinnertime in Bangalore. I was tired and jet-lagged; my mind wasn’t working properly. I went down to the restaurant of my little hotel, and immediately I regretted it. It was small, stuffy, lit in a harsh white. There was no customer but myself. A bevy of masked and waistcoated waiters ushered me to a little cubicle. I sat down and tried to think of a pretext to leave, then mumbled an order for whatever might be served the quickest. This was going to be dire.<br />Suddenly, everything changed. By the time I returned from washing my hands, the table had been laid with the giant green frond of a banana tree and two little katoris, or bowls. A waiter came to heap the leaf up with hot white rice, topped with a drizzle of aromatic golden ghee. Another arrived with small pails of sautéed and stewed vegetables, some diced, others mashed, and ladled out a spoonful of each. A third poured gloopy yellow daal, specked with cumin seeds, and a thin red tomato broth into the bowls. A fourth supplied dabs of chutney, pickles, salt, sliced cucumbers and whole chilies, a slightly lighter shade of green than the bed on which they rested. Dinner was ready."
