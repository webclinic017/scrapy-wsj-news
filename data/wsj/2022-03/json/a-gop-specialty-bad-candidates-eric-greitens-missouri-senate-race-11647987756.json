    "body": "The importance of a U.S. Senate majority is on display this week as Democrats rally to confirm Joe Biden’s Supreme Court nominee. Perhaps Republicans should consider the point before nominating another lousy Senate candidate in a race they should win.<br />Witness Eric Greitens, who is running for the open Senate seat in Missouri. In 2018 he resigned as Governor amid allegations he’d sexually coerced a hairdresser and photographed her bound and nude as blackmail if she divulged the affair. Mr. Greitens’s ex-wife, Sheena Greitens, has alleged in court documents that Mr. Greitens physically abused her and their sons, in addition to isolating them in a lake house, and repeatedly threatening suicide to force Ms. Greitens to publicly support him."
