    "body": "The Biden administration is planning to give preference to infrastructure projects that encourage workers to unionize or that hire from underrepresented groups as it prepares to spend billions of dollars from last year’s infrastructure law, administration officials said.<br />The guidelines are the latest of several attempts by the Biden administration to promote labor unions. President Biden, a longtime labor advocate, has frequently hailed the infrastructure law by saying it will create union jobs. Administration officials say the guidelines will also help companies diversify their workforce in the midst of a labor shortage. The Department of Transportation and the Department of Labor have been working together to write the funding guidelines."
