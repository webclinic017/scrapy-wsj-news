    "body": "Russia’s increasing isolation from the West will leave it looking towards China for alternative economic partnerships. Aviation is a prime example: Badly hit by sanctions, the Russian industry has little choice but to double down on collaboration with its big peer to the East.<br />Commercial aviation faces ruin in Russia because the U.S. and its allies have blocked the sale of aircraft, parts and technical support to the country. Since the 1990s, Soviet Union-era aircraft have been replaced by  Boeing  and  Airbus  models, with domestically built planes currently making up only 17% of the fleet, Cirium data shows. Without new parts, airlines like  Aeroflot  and S7 Airlines will eventually need to ground their jets."
