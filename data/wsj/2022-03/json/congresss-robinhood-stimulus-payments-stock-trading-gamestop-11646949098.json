    "body": "Recall the political uproar last winter over the frenetic trading in meme stocks like  GameStop ? Members of Congress blamed hedge funds, market makers and the online trading platform  Robinhood .  Well, a new study has identified the more likely culprit: Congress’s stimulus payments.<br />U.S. households received $814 billion in three rounds of direct payments between April 2020 and March 2021. Congress gave low- and middle-income adults $3,200 each plus $2,500 per dependent to cope with the pandemic. Many instead used their payments to play the stock market, according to Harvard Business School and New York University economists."
