    "body": "Two conclusions from the student-loan fiasco are plain (“The Great Pandemic Student-Loan Scam,” Review & Outlook, March 19). First, there is a very large number of college degrees that are not worth the price. Wake up, parents and students. Second, the federal government is a grossly incompetent lender of money. Wake up, taxpayers.<br />A less obvious conclusion is that the flood of federal money into these institutions via loans has caused the unprecedented inflation in college education and made them unaffordable for most. This has led to the government controlling these institutions, since it is the de facto financier."
