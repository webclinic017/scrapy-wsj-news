    "body": "Ukrainians continue to flee Vladimir Putin’s bombs, and 3.7 million have left the country, per the latest figures from the United Nations. This is a catastrophe, and the U.S. should do its part both to ease the suffering and to help relieve NATO allies like Poland.<br />President Biden committed Thursday to “welcome 100,000 Ukrainians to the United States with a focus on reuniting families.” That’s a good start, and it sounds like a large figure. Yet it’s less than 3% of the total refugees. Spread across the U.S., it breaks down to 2,000 per state, and New York is a pretty big place, to say nothing of Texas or California."
