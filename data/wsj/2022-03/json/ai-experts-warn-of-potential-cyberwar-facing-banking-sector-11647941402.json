    "body": "U.S. authorities have cautioned banks about possible cyberattacks following Russia’s recent invasion of Ukraine, but experts say financial institutions also face particular risks in a more murky area of their business—the now ubiquitous artificial-intelligence models that handle everything from lending to trading.<br />Fears of Russia-linked cyberattacks, long a threat to businesses, gained new urgency when Russian soldiers launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine last month. U.S. authorities have flagged the U.S. financial system, a central pillar in the U.S. sanctions regime, as an attractive target, and officials and security experts have warned for weeks about the possibility of retaliatory cyberattacks from Russia. Financial institutions’ AI systems are uniquely exposed."
