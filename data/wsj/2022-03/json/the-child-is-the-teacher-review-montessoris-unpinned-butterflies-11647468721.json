    "body": "The Montessori method of education is known for promoting the autonomy of children and de-emphasizing the influence of teachers, so it’s striking that its creator was such an authoritarian. Maria Montessori wanted her revolutionary pedagogical approach to spread from her native Italy across the globe, yet she tried to maintain an iron grip on its interpretation and use as it did so. The American educator who wrote the preface to the 1912 English translation of “The Montessori Method” must have gotten wind of the author’s difficult reputation. He stated, as if wishing could make it true, that “Dr. Montessori is too large-minded to claim infallibility, and too thoroughly scientific in her attitude to object to careful scrutiny of her scheme and the thorough testing of its results.”<br />He was mistaken on all counts. As Cristina De Stefano demonstrates in her compelling biography “The Child Is the Teacher,” Montessori, while trained as a scientist, over time began to conceive of herself as a prophet. Prophets typically don’t care to be scrutinized and tested."
