    "body": "WASHINGTON—As it seeks to counter China’s global influence and respond to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, the Biden administration is confronting strains in its relationship with India, one of its most vital Asian partnerships.<br />Tension has surfaced since India, despite U.S. pressure, declined this week to support a United Nations resolution condemning Russia’s assault on Ukraine.
