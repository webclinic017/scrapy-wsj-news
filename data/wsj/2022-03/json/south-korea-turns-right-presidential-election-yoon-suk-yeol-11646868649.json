    "body": "The narrow victory by conservative opposition candidate Yoon Suk-yeol in South Korea's presidential election can’t be called a rousing mandate. But it is an opportunity for closer security ties between Seoul and Washington.<br />The race was largely fought over domestic issues, including corruption and housing prices. Neither party took on the chaebol, the giant companies that dominate South Korea’s export economy and often have a cozy relationship with government. But Mr. Yoon put economic opportunity above ruling party candidate Lee Jae-myung’s focus on income redistribution."
