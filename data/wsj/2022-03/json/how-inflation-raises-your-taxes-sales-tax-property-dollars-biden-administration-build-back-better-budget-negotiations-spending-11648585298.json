    "body": "When President Biden first proposed increasing federal spending by trillions, he promised not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400,000 a year. But the Federal Reserve’s accommodation of his spendthrift policies is now creating inflation taxes that are hitting ordinary Americans in their pocketbooks. Inflation not only taxes away earnings and savings, it also amplifies a host of other taxes Americans pay.<br />Inflation is now reducing the real earnings of many Americans. As the purchasing power of a dollar falls, many Americans are taxed on the extent to which their paychecks aren’t keeping up with inflation. But even Americans lucky enough to have their wages and salaries keep pace with inflation may find themselves paying additional federal, state and local taxes on their increased nominal incomes."
