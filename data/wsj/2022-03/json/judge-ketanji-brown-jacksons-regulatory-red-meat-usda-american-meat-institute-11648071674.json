    "body": "Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson has been less expansive even than most Supreme Court nominees this week as she faces the Senate. She says she has a judicial “methodology” but not a philosophy, and her record as a judge is thin. But one case that offers some insight is her 2013 ruling as a trial judge upholding a U.S. Department of Agriculture country-of-origin rule for meat.<br />Congress in 2008 required grocery stores to provide country-of-origin information on meat and directed the USDA to write the regulation. The purpose was to promote U.S. livestock. USDA required meat to be labeled with the countries where the animal was born, raised and slaughtered. It also barred processors from “commingling” meat from different countries—a common industry practice of mixing animals from different producers together for slaughter and packaging—in the name of simplifying its labeling regime."
