Now some lawmakers are pushing for the country to adopt a law that would allow it to do more.<br />New Zealand—a member of the “Five Eyes” intelligence grouping that includes the U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K.—doesn’t have an independent sanctions law that would allow it to target Russian President Vladimir Putin, lawmakers and oligarchs directly while also restricting Russia’s ability to access global financial markets."
