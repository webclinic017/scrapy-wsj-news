    "body": "Who would ever want to do business with Devon Archer? The U.S. Justice Department announced this week that Archer was sentenced to “a year and a day in prison for defrauding a Native American tribal entity and various investment advisory clients of tens of millions of dollars in connection with the issuance of bonds by the tribal entity and the subsequent sale of those bonds through fraudulent and deceptive means.”<br />“As established by the evidence at trial,” a Justice press release reports, Archer and others “engaged in a fraudulent scheme that involved (a) causing the Wakpamni Lake Community Corporation (‘WLCC’), a Native American tribal entity, to issue a series of bonds (the ‘Tribal Bonds’) through lies and misrepresentations; (b) deceptively causing clients of asset management firms controlled by Hirst, Morton, and others to purchase the Tribal Bonds, which the clients were then unable to redeem or sell because the bonds were illiquid and lacked a ready secondary market; and (c) misappropriating the proceeds resulting from those bond sales.”"
