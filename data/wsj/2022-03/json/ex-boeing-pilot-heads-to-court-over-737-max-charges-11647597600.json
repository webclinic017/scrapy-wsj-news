    "body": "A former  Boeing Co.  pilot accused of misleading federal air-safety regulators before two 737 MAX jets crashed is set to go on trial starting Friday.<br />Lawyers for Mark Forkner, who was the 737 MAX’s chief technical pilot during its development, are planning to argue that their client is being singled out as the scapegoat for broader aviation disasters. Mr. Forkner is the only person charged with crimes related to the crashes by the Justice Department, part of the agency’s efforts to hold individuals accountable for corporate misdeeds."
