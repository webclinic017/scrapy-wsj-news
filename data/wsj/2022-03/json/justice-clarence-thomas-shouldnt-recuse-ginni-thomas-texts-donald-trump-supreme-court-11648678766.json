    "body": "We argued on Saturday that the leak of Ginni Thomas’s text messages gathered by the House Jan. 6 special committee was intended to damage her husband, Justice Clarence Thomas, and the Supreme Court. Vindication certainly didn’t take long.<br />Democrats and their media allies quickly sped past Ginni to demand that Justice Thomas resign (Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), or be impeached (Rep. Ilhan Omar), or at least recuse himself from hearing cases related to elections (Sen. Amy Klobuchar, et al.)."
