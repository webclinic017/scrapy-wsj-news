    "body": "ON PAGE 70 of the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Catalog, a rakish gardener with a long white beard perches atop a tall ladder. Beside him a massive kale plant grows. A fulsome paragraph describes ‘Walking Stick’ as an extremely productive kale, a standout variety from antiquity capable of growing over 20 feet tall. I’m riveted, though I know in my heart I won’t grow this enormous, novelty kale in my small city garden. No matter, I earmark the page, emboldened, and move on.<br />Between January and March, I read seed catalogs like other people read novels. The volumes swamp household surfaces with their floriferous covers: thumbed, dog-eared, etched with notes. I consume them while dreaming of warmer days, resplendent flower borders and a heaving kitchen garden. In reality, my seed-growing escapades are primarily a floral affair involving terra-cotta pots and a few diminutive, dappled borders."
