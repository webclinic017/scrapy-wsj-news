    "body": "As soon as I read the headline “I Covered My Face, and I’m Ashamed” (op-ed, March 15) I knew exactly what Rebecca Sugar meant. The masking policies foisted on the American public were ineffective at best and harmful at worst. Very early on in the pandemic, I wondered how cloth masks adorned with sports-team logos, smiley faces and color coordinated to match our outfits could do anything to stop the spread of Covid. They couldn’t and to keep pretending they can is irrational and sad.<br />Mike McKeen"
