    "body": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank was prepared to raise interest rates in half-percentage-point steps and high enough to deliberately slow the economy if it concluded such steps were warranted to bring down inflation.<br />“If we think it’s appropriate to raise [by a half point] at a meeting or meetings, we will do so,” Mr. Powell said during a moderated discussion after a speech on Monday before the National Association for Business Economics in Washington, D.C."
