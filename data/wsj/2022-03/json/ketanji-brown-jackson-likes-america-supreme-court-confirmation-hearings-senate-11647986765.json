    "body": "Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson faced hours of questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, and she held up fine, though Supreme Court confirmation hearings are now akin to the Circumlocution Olympics. We’d still like to hear her speak candidly about how she thinks judges ought to interpret the Constitution.<br />But it was heartening to hear Judge Jackson affirm the promise of America. Too many on the left seem to think the U.S. is structurally, irredeemably flawed. President Biden has joined this narrative with his focus on “systemic racism” and “equity” in place of “equality.” Judge Jackson might or might not agree with the ideal of colorblindness, to say nothing of her views on specific controversies like the one involving Harvard’s admissions policies."
