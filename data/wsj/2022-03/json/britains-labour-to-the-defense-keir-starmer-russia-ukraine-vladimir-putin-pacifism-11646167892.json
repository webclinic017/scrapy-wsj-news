    "body": "Pacifism runs through the veins of most European political parties of the left, but Vladimir Putin’s Ukraine invasion highlights the urgent need for a transfusion. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is attempting such a treatment for his Social Democrats, and he’s been joined by Keir Starmer of Britain’s Labour Party.<br />Mr. Starmer put tough action behind his pro-NATO words when he threatened last week to expel 11 sitting lawmakers from the party if they didn’t recant a letter they signed criticizing the Western alliance. Prominent party figures such as Diane Abbott and John McConnell, who served in the shadow cabinet under former leader Jeremy Corbyn, had put their names to a Stop the War Coalition statement blaming the British government and NATO for provoking Mr. Putin and “refut[ing] the idea that NATO is a defensive alliance.”"
