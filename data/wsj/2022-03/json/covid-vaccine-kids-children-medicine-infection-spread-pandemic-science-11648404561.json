    "body": "Regarding Allysia Finley’s “Healthy Children Don’t Need Vaccines” (op-ed, March 21): Florida got it wrong. Covid-19 vaccines are essential for children’s health. Florida officials underestimate the risks of the virus and the benefits of vaccination.<br />Nearly 1,100 children have died from Covid—more than five times as many that die in a typical flu season. More than 6,800 cases of MIS-C have been reported in children, including 48 deaths. We are only beginning to understand the long-term complications of Covid in children."
