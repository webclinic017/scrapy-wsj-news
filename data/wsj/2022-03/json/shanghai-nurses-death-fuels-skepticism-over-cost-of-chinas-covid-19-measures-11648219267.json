    "body": "The death of a Shanghai nurse from asthma after she was turned away from her own hospital because the emergency room was closed for disinfection has roiled residents, highlighting the pressure on officials to lessen the impact of antivirus measures on people’s lives.<br />China’s financial center saw a record 1,609 Covid cases Friday, more than a third of the nationwide total. While officials insist they won’t impose a citywide lockdown, extensive district-by-district restrictions have hindered many of the city’s 25 million residents from going to work, buying food or getting medical treatment. As of Friday, 41 of Shanghai’s main hospitals had suspended some outpatient and emergency services because of anti-Covid measures."
