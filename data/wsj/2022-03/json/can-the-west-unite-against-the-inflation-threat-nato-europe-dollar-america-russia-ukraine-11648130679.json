    "body": "Leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s member countries have gathered this week to discuss how to strengthen the military alliance in the face of Vladimir Putin’s aggression. For the sake of the alliance, the next step should be a summit of finance ministers and central bankers to address the economic problems that increasingly threaten to undermine Western cooperation. They should start with inflation.<br />Two points are relevant. First, although NATO is a military alliance, its members also de facto constitute one of the world’s largest trading blocs, and a complex one. The European Union has knit together a continental free-trade area encompassing its 27 member states plus assorted neighbors. The U.S. remains by far the most important single external trading partner for the EU."
