    "body": "The Regency-era, American-produced, British-accented “Bridgerton” was the second most-watched series on Netflix last year. No. 1 was “Squid Game,” which says something about something. What the popularity of “Bridgerton” seems to say is that audiences suffer an incurable weakness for lavishly produced, “Downton Abbey”-adjacent soap operas that provide luxurious, vicarious immersions into the kind obscenely wealthy environs from which many of their ancestors would have either been tossed out on their ear, or offered employment emptying chamber pots.<br />And yet: While the privileged atmosphere, back-stabbing, rampant rutting and frocks are certainly part of the “Bridgerton” allure, so is the refreshing acknowledgment of how dumb it all is. Even the carriage horses seem to be in on the joke. So, like its predecessor, season 2 is a guilty pleasure without much guilt."
