    "body": "Argentina’s Senate on Thursday night approved a government deal to refinance $44 billion in debt with the International Monetary Fund just days before the country risked falling into arrears with the Washington-based lender.<br />The Senate vote was the last major hurdle in Argentina to roll over its debt with the IMF and avert a default that economists say would lead to greater financial turmoil in Latin America’s third-biggest economy. The IMF’s board still needs to approve the agreement."
