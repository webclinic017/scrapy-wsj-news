    "body": "Republicans are fed up with the Biden Administration’s animus toward fossil-fuel pipelines, which hampers America’s energy industry. But the GOP also should take a skeptical look at the Jones Act’s malign effects. Hawaii annually imports several million barrels of Russian crude oil. Depending on the year, this accounts for roughly 10% to 25% of Russian crude shipments to the U.S.<br />One reason is the 1920 Jones Act, which says that waterborne cargo between U.S. ports must travel via ships that are built, crewed and owned by Americans. As usual with protectionism, this is expensive, and it’s especially hard on outlying areas like Hawaii. Another perverse result is that the law puts U.S.-made products at a disadvantage against foreign competitors, which can use market rate shipping."
