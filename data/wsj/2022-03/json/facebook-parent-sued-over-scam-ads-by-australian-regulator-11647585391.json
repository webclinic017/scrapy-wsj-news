    "body": "An Australian regulator is suing  Meta Platforms Inc.,  accusing it of not doing enough to remove scam ads from Facebook that featured public figures promoting cryptocurrency, deepening the social media giant’s legal troubles over the issue.<br />The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission alleged in federal court that the scam ads were still being displayed on Facebook even after public figures around the world complained that their names and images were being used without consent. One of them, Andrew Forrest, the chairman and largest shareholder of major iron ore producer  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. , has filed litigation against  Meta  in Australian and American courts over similar fake ads."
