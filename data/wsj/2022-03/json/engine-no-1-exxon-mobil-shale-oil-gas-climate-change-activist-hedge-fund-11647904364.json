    "body": "Many readers may have been surprised to see Christopher James, the founder of Engine No. 1 and guiding force behind its successful proxy contest at Exxon Mobil, calling for increased production of U.S. shale oil (“U.S. Shale Is the Key to a Renewable Future,” op-ed, March 18). However, I am not one of them. As I’ve argued in the Harvard Business Law Review, Engine No. 1’s activism at Exxon wasn’t really about mitigating climate change. It was a clever way to generate investor interest in the launch of two Engine No. 1-sponsored ETFs.<br />Engine No. 1 did not provide Exxon Mobil with any guidance on how it could transition from a global leader in oil and gas production to one focused on the production of clean energy. If it truly wanted to mitigate climate change by changing Exxon Mobil’s business strategy, Engine No. 1 would have provided the company with such guidance."
