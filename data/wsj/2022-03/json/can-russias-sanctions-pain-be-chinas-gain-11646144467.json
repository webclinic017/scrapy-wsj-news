    "body": "What does the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the surprisingly strong Western response look like from Beijing? Potentially a boon over the long run on the energy front, but deeply worrying financially.<br />Budding Sino-Russian entente aside, a full-out attempt to dilute Western sanctions in Russia’s favor is unlikely because of the risk to China’s own technology and financial champions. Beijing will intensify efforts to insulate itself from the possibility of similarly united sanctions down the road, but it will continue to be hindered by the desire to maintain a high degree of control over the yuan."
