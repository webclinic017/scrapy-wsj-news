    "body": "China’s Huawei Technologies Co. has seen its 5G business suffer because of restrictions imposed by the U.S. and other countries. But its booming software business is throwing the telecom giant a lifeline.<br />Huawei’s enterprise business group has emerged as its fastest-growing division recently, as the company’s handset sales plunge and it faces setbacks in its business with telecom operators. Several countries, led by the U.S., have banned the use of Huawei equipment in 5G networks, and the U.S. has also imposed broad controls on the use of American technology by the company, blocking its acquisition of many advanced chips."
