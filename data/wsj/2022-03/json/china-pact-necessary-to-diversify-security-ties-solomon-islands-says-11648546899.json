    "body": "ADELAIDE, Australia—Solomon Islands is pursuing a closer relationship with China because it no longer feels traditional partners such as Australia can meet all of its security needs, the Pacific island nation’s leader said.<br />Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said officials are ready to sign a security pact with China, rejecting criticism that it risks fueling tensions in the region.
