    "body": "In “How Bill Clinton Sealed Ukraine’s Fate” (op-ed, March 25), George Bogden argues that the Clinton administration’s “undisciplined fixation” on nuclear disarmament stripped Ukraine of the arms that could have deterred Russia today. But stopping the spread of nuclear weapons, even to treaty allies, has always been a central pillar of U.S. strategy. Any U.S. president would have taken a similar approach.<br />Moreover, Kyiv did not possess operational control of the Soviet nuclear weapons stationed in Ukrainian territory. The weapons were never really Ukraine’s to keep."
