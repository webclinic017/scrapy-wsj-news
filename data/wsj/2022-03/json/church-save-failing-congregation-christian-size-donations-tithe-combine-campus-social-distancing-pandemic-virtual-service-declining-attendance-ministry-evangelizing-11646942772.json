    "body": "American churches are in trouble. Even before the pandemic, thousands of them were closing every year. Only 47% of Americans said they belong to a church, synagogue or mosque, according to a 2021 Gallup survey, down from 70% in 1999. Last year only 28% of Americans went to church regularly. An overwhelming majority of churches believe they have plateaued or are in decline.<br />Why is this happening, and can more church closings be averted? Many churches are declining from a lack of leadership. There may be an older pastor who has a good heart and has been serving a long time but struggles to connect with the younger generation. Some long-established churches have a hard time changing even though the community around them has. Combined with the pandemic, itâ€™s no wonder so many young Christians have left the churches they were raised in."
