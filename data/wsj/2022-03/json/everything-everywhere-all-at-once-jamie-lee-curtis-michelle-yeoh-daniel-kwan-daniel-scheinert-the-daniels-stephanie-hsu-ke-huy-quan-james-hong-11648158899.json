    "body": "‘Everything Everywhere All at Once” may be the most literal film title since Georges Méliès made “A Trip to the Moon.” This ingenious dazzler—half-poignant epic, half-prank—by filmmaking duo Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert (aka The Daniels) introduces us to one woman, Evelyn Wang (Michelle Yeoh, of “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”), and her multitudes, the infinite Evelyns scattered across the multiverse whose decisions, big and small, peeled their life trajectories apart from the Alpha Evelyn, a brilliant scientist who invented a technique to leap between her counterparts.<br />A successful verse jump, as it’s called, requires the traveler to break loose of expectations by doing something bizarre. Swallow a tube of lip balm, perhaps, or snort a housefly. The less sense it makes, the better—a dare the writer-directors embrace, both in brainstorming stunts that tickle the audience to laugh and in concocting this demented yet meticulously crafted ode to chaos."
