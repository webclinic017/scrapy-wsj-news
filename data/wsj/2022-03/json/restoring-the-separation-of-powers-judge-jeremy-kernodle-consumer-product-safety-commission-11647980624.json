    "body": "A major judicial project of the coming years should be reasserting the separation of powers as properly understood in the U.S. Constitution. A small, but perhaps consequential, step in that direction arrived March 18 in a federal court ruling against the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).<br />Federal Judge Jeremy Kernodle ruled that a Congressional restriction on the President’s power to remove members of the CPSC is unconstitutional (Consumers’ Research and By Two LP v. CPSC). The plaintiffs are education companies that were denied fee waivers for Freedom of Information Act requests by the CPSC."
