    "body": "Agreeing with George Kennan, Peggy Noonan says, “It was a mistake to enlarge NATO by admitting former Warsaw Pact states” (“Where Putin Goes From Here,” Declarations, Feb. 26). This, she says, weakened Russian liberals and emboldened hard-liners.<br />Vladimir Putin, however, has explicitly stated that he views Ukraine as part of Russia. He was determined to reclaim this allegedly lost Russian territory regardless of whether, say, Poland joined NATO. NATO expansion was always a convenient pretext, but never the reason, for Russia’s invasions of Ukraine."
