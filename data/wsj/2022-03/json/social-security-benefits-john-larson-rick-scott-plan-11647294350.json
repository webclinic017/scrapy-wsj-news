    "body": "In “Why I’m Defying Beltway Cowardice” (op-ed, March 4), Sen. Rick Scott defends his Rescue America Plan. I give him credit for being honest about what Republicans intend to do: raise taxes on lower- and middle-income Americans and end federal programs after five years. His plan is cruel and would threaten the financial security of all Americans, but he is right on one thing: The public needs to know where their representatives stand, and Congress needs to act.<br />The urgency to act on Social Security is clear. The elderly are not only the most susceptible to this pandemic; since they are on fixed incomes, they are also the most susceptible to inflation. They need help and they need it now. It has been more than 50 years since Congress enhanced Social Security benefits and 39 years since it strengthened the program. That’s why Social Security 2100: A Sacred Trust is currently being marked up in the House Ways and Means Committee and has bipartisan support among Americans and more than 200 co-sponsors in Congress. It boosts benefits and strengthens the program."
