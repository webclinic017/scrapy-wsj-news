    "body": "WHEN I STARTED cycling in New York City about 17 years ago, I was a fair-weather rider. A mere drizzle would dissuade me from peddling off and instead, I’d descend, raincoat-clad, into the subway. But my calculus changed when a new job seriously complicated my commute: Biking to work became the more practical option, whatever the clouds threatened. The first rainy day, I anxiously installed a freebie fender that came with my bike and braced for the worst.<br />It wasn’t that bad. Rain had forced traffic to a standstill, but I breezed through it on my bike as rain pitter-pattered on my cheeks and nose. I couldn’t help but smile. Since then, I’ve ridden in the rain countless times. It can be pleasant, even cinematic, especially on warm April afternoons and misty May mornings, when showers are light but still keep tenderfoot riders off the road. Preparation is key, but you need less gear than you’d expect. With just a really good set of lights, some gloves and fenders, you can make riding through a downpour feel a lot less like…riding in a downpour."
