For that matter, there is no replicating the bold bite of a radish just plucked from the dirt. And the sting of watercress right out of the stream is so far removed from any store-bought version, it should just be called a different thing entirely.<br />Spring is a wonderful time to eat, and its abundant leaves, stalks, bulbs and shoots, in peak season and at their most flavorful, require very little fussing in the kitchen. When the ingredients are this lovely, a smart cook simply gets out of the way and lets the harvest speak for itself."
