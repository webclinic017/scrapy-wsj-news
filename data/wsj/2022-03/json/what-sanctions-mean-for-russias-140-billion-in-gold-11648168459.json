    "body": "The U.S. is clamping down on Russia’s ability to sell its gold reserves and raise money, the latest effort to cripple the country’s war chest while the invasion of Ukraine continues.<br />The Treasury Department clarified Thursday that any transaction involving gold related to Russia’s central bank falls under existing sanctions, its latest step to limit Russia’s capacity to raise money. Although it would be difficult for Russia to sell its gold stash, analysts say the challenge of tracing gold through the ancient physical market allows potential loopholes for Moscow to raise funds this way."
