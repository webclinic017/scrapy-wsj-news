    "body": "“The Power Struggle” (Exchange, Feb. 19) is compelling on the need to upgrade aging power-transmission infrastructure. We need to think as carefully about where we will get our power. No source of electricity is infallible. That’s why we need a mix of coal, natural gas, nuclear power and renewable energy. When some of these underperform, others can fill the gap. This makes the grid more reliable and electricity prices more affordable and stable. It can also help save lives.<br />During extreme cold weather a year ago, average capacity factors in a 15-state region of the Midwest were 90% for nuclear plants, 84% for coal-fired plants, 40% for natural-gas plants and 17% for wind. Wind was the only electricity source whose capacity factor declined during the cold weather. The capacity factor for coal increased more than any of the others. This doesn’t mean that wind is a bad source of electricity. Rather, these numbers show the value of having a mix of resources that includes coal."
