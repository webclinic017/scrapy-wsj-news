    "body": "It might seem surprising that Ukrainians have fought so well, but it wasn’t surprising they would fight, given their knowledge of what living under Vladimir Putin’s regime really is like. Nor that the Russian army would underperform: Mr. Putin’s mooning of late about the religiously transcendent purpose of the Russian state always sits oddly in a regime that exists to loot the state, as any conscript can see.<br />Even those Russians who support the war know the truth about their leaders: They are thieves."
