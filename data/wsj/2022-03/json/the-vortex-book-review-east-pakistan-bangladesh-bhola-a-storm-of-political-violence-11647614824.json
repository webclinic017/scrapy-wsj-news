    "body": "Yahya Khan was Pakistan’s military dictator from March 1969 to December 1971. But for his penchant for genocide, we’d regard him as a uniformed buffoon from the cast of an operetta, with his bushy eyebrows, thirst for booze and priapic lust for plump paramours. It was somehow fitting that he declared war on India in a whiskey-fueled rage after finding his mistress in bed with his own son.<br />The mistress was Bengali—from East Pakistan, now Bangladesh—and it is entirely possible that she cuckolded Yahya Khan in this spectacular way as a form of revenge for what the general was doing to her people. In March 1971—under a plan called Operation Searchlight—the Pakistan army, consisting predominantly of Punjabi soldiers from West Pakistan, was given orders to conduct massacres in Bengali-dominated East Pakistan. As Scott Carney and Jason Miklian tell us in “The Vortex,” soldiers killed 25,000 unarmed civilians in the first 12 hours of the operation, targeting especially East Pakistan’s intelligentsia and Hindu minority. By the time the army left several months later, an estimated three million Bengalis had been killed, with 10 million more marooned as refugees in neighboring India."
