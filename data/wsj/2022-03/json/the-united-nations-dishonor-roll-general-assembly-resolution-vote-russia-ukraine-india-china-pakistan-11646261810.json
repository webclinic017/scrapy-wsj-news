    "body": "The United Nations is mostly irrelevant these days, but it’s still worth noting the dishonor roll in Wednesday’s General Assembly vote on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The resolution has no legal consequences, though it gives you the moral flavor of the joint.<br />The vote to denounce the invasion, which is a clear violation of the U.N. Charter, was 141-4, with 35 abstentions. Belarus—which is Russia’s mini me and is aiding the invasion—Eritrea, North Korea and Syria voted against the resolution."
