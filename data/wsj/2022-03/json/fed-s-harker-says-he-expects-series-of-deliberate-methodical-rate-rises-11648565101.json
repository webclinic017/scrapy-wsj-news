    "body": "Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said Tuesday unacceptable levels of inflation call for an aggressive path of interest rate rises to remedy surging price pressures.<br />“Inflation is running far too high, and I am acutely concerned about this,” Mr. Harker said in a speech in New York. “The bottom line is that generous fiscal policies, supply-chain disruptions and accommodative monetary policy have pushed inflation far higher than I—and my colleagues on the FOMC—are comfortable with,” he said."
