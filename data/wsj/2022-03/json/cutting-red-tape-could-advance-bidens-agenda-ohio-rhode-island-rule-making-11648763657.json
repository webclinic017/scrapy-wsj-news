    "body": "By nearly every measure, regulations in the U.S. have increased substantially over the last century. In 1950 there were fewer than 10,000 pages in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations. Today that number stands at 186,000. Federal regulators spent about $5 billion in 1960 in today’s dollars, compared with around $81 billion in 2019. The number of people working at federal regulatory agencies is now approaching 300,000.<br />In light of these facts, the growth of federal regulation appears impossible to stop. But several states are showing unexpected signs of progress in their battle against red tape, and this could bode well for reforms at the federal level."
