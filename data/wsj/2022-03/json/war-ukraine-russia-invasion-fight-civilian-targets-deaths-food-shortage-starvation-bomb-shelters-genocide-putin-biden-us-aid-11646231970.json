    "body": "In the weeks before the attack on Ukraine, a dozen different friends there told me it wouldn’t happen. (I was born in Soviet Ukraine; my family fled in the 1970s.) Even if Russia went on the offensive, they doubted it would last: Why would Vladimir Putin want to take on 43 million new problems?<br />Some also weren’t confident that their army, much less the cynical citizenry, would pick up arms to fight. Ukrainians are world-weary, worn down by high unemployment, slack growth and government corruption. Now they say the Russian assault has galvanized and united their people. One said this invasion will be worse for Russia than Afghanistan in the 1980s."
