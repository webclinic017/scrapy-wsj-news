    "body": "Opponents call it Florida’s “don’t say gay” bill, and the political branding seems to have worked, given how the mainstream press laundered that charged phrase into a national rallying cry. The legislation passed the Florida Senate on Tuesday, and it now awaits Gov. Ron DeSantis’s signature.<br />What does the seven-page bill actually do? One section says schools generally “may not discourage or prohibit parental notification of and involvement in critical decisions affecting a student’s mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being.” Parents also can’t be blocked from “education and health records created, maintained, or used by the school.”"
