    "body": "Apparel retailers and department stores are bumping up against pockets of price resistance, a sign that consumers are curtailing spending as inflation remains at the highest level in four decades.<br />Macy’s Inc.  tried to raise prices on some mattresses and sofas by $100, but shoppers pushed back, Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said. Clothing brand Bella Dahl raised prices on its T-shirts by about $20, then sales fell and the company rolled back the price increase. “There was a revolt,” said Steven Millman, its chief brand officer. “If we go any higher, we’ll do half the sales.”"
