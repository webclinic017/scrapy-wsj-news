    "body": "Tesla Inc.  Chief Executive Elon Musk asked a federal judge on Tuesday to scrap a settlement he reached with securities regulators in 2018 that required some of his tweets be preapproved, a condition that has fomented an ongoing conflict with the government over whether he and  Tesla  have followed the rule.<br />In a motion filed in Manhattan federal court, Mr. Musk’s lawyers argued that the  Twitter  oversight policy has become unworkable, while the Securities and Exchange Commission has abused the deal to make “round after round of demands for voluminous, costly document productions, with no signs of abatement.”"
