    "body": "The U.S. Postal Service is bankrupt. Its liabilities have exceeded its assets for many years. Any reform bill (“Congress Says the Check Is in the Mail,” Review & Outlook, Feb. 18) is doomed to fail unless it answers the right question: How should Postal Service assets be used in the internet age? When USPS faces the facts and declares bankruptcy, assets can be sold to new owners, congressional limitations would not apply to a successor entity, and employees would be paid at market rates.<br />The national sorting and shipping backbone could be sold as a unit to a government entity or a private operator, ensuring uninterrupted national and international service. This would be similar to how  AT&T  retained its long-distance network after divesting its local Bell companies."
