    "body": "The Western press cheers each announcement of another seized Russian yacht. But the cheers are premature: The sanctions as implemented are likely to backfire because they give Russians no chance to switch sides. The U.S. and Europe should offer a better escape hatch for both elite and ordinary Russians.<br />The barriers the West is erecting are an ironic reversal of history. The Soviet Union built the Berlin Wall to keep Eastern bloc citizens in. Today the West is building a wall around Russia. This has three important implications."
