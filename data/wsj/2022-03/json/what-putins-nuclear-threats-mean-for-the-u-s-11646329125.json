    "body": "On the eve of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Vladimir Putin issued a nuclear warning. He admonished that “anyone who tries to interfere with us…must know that Russia’s response will be immediate and will lead you to such consequences as you have never before experienced in your history.” In case anyone misunderstood his warning, he added that Russia remains “one of the most powerful nuclear powers” with “certain advantages in a number of the latest types of weapons” and stated that “no one should have any doubt that a direct attack on Russia will lead to defeat and dire consequences for a potential aggressor.” A few days later, he upped the ante further with the public announcement of a Russian nuclear alert.<br />The U.S. cannot overlook these chilling threats. They are part of a deliberate strategy to advance Russia’s revisionist political and military goals. Countering them will require the U.S. and its friends to tailor both their conventional and their nuclear postures to the emerging danger—not only in the current crisis with Russia but also to prepare for the possibility that China might follow the same playbook in a future war over Taiwan."
