    "body": "Republican governors in Indiana and Utah vetoed bills that would have barred transgender girls from competing in female sports at school, differing from GOP leaders in other states who have signed similar rules into law.<br />Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox struck down similar bills this week as the debate over whether transgender athletes—particularly those competing in girls’ and women’s sports—can compete in sports leagues that differ from their biological sex at birth has become a contentious battle in some state legislatures."
