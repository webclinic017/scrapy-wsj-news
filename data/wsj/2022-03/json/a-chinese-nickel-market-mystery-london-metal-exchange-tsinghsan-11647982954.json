    "body": "Market ructions amid war aren’t unusual. But the London Metal Exchange’s retroactive cancellation of nickel trades this month appears to be unprecedented. One question is whether the Hong Kong-owned exchange intervened to rescue a Chinese nickel tycoon.<br />Nickel prices were climbing for the better part of a year prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, amid rising demand for electric-vehicle batteries and stainless steel. Russia supplies about 20% of the world’s high-grade nickel, and worries about sanctions sent prices higher. This threatened the Tsingshan Holding Group, which had built a large short position."
