    "body": "Nickel at $100,000 a ton is evidence of a financial squeeze more than one related to the underlying commodity. It still illustrates the risks associated with the bets on green energy now piling up in investors’ brokerage accounts.<br />Renewable-energy stocks have been among the few gainers in the rocky markets since Russia invaded Ukraine, in keeping with the energy sector more generally. Wind turbine maker Vestas Wind Systems, for example—the largest stock in the S&P  Global Clean Energy  Index—has risen 37% since hitting a 20-month low two weeks ago. There has been strong buying of clean-tech stocks from individual investors, according to data provider VandaTrack, though interest remains far lower than it was at the start of 2021 following President Biden’s election victory."
