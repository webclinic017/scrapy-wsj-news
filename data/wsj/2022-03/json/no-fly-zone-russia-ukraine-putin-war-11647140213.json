    "body": "Given the dizzyingly high stakes that attend to deeper U.S. involvement in Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion, I was surprised by the cursory nature of Joe Lieberman’s op-ed “The Case for a No-Fly Zone in Ukraine” (March 10).<br />Though he offers little evidence that a no-fly zone will serve U.S. strategic aims, he expresses confidence that America’s larger interests demand such an escalation, and that inaction would be the riskier course. This leads to the claim that the purpose of enforcing a no-fly zone must surely be understood as defensive. The trouble is that military actions send their own signals, and we do not get to determine beforehand how they will be interpreted by Russia."
