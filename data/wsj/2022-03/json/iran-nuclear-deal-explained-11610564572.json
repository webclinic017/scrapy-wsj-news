    "body": "Iran, the U.S. and other world powers are nearing a deal to revive a 2015 agreement that curbs Tehran’s nuclear work in return for relief from international sanctions.<br />Russia recently made last-minute demands from the U.S. that its future economic ties with Iran after a nuclear deal wouldn’t be restricted by Western sanctions imposed on Moscow over Ukraine.
