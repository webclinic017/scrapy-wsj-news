    "body": "Millennials—now America’s largest generational voting bloc, born between 1981 and 1996—have had the risks of overseas American military involvement drilled into us since childhood. Having largely missed the foreign-policy victories of the Cold War, we had our understanding of America’s place in the world shaped by the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.<br />Those wars included consequential mistakes, but the politicized story lines that sprung up around them flattened complex reality into politically expedient myth. Such conspiratorial narratives as “it was all about the oil” metastasized in the imagination of many young Americans, leaving a generation paranoid about U.S. foreign entanglement and oblivious to the costs of inaction. Rather than learning about the complexities of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, we grew up immersed in a simplistic, sweeping narrative: American intervention is bad."
