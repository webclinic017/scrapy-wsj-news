    "body": "BRUSSELS—The European Union said it plans to store more natural gas and diversify its sources, aiming to cut its imports of Russian supplies by two-thirds by the end of this year.<br />The invasion of Ukraine has highlighted Europe’s dependence on energy imports from Russia, which last year accounted for about 40% of its natural-gas consumption. The EU has been under pressure to come up with a plan to survive next winter if Russian supplies are cut off, either by Moscow or because of damage to pipelines that run across Ukraine."
