    "body": "The Russian invasion of Ukraine has finally motivated European leaders to say they’ll spend more on defense, but promises are the easy part. One task for President Biden at this week’s NATO summit will be pushing the Europeans to be specific about how much they’ll spend and what they’ll buy.<br />European Union heads of state or government said in a March 11 declaration that “we must resolutely invest more and better in defence capabilities.” After a two-day meeting, the leaders vowed to “increase substantially defence expenditures” and “invest further in the capabilities necessary to conduct the full range of missions.”"
