    "body": "NEW DELHI—As the U.S. and its Western allies move to reduce Russian oil imports, India is heading in the other direction.<br />The country has struck a deal in recent days for 3 million barrels of crude oil from Russia for delivery in May, and is looking to secure more supplies in the weeks ahead, two Indian government officials said. The government is seeking to offset the impact of surging oil prices by securing additional supplies from Russia at a discount. The Russian crude is being offered at around 20% below global benchmark prices, one of the officials said, with insurance and shipping costs borne by the seller."
