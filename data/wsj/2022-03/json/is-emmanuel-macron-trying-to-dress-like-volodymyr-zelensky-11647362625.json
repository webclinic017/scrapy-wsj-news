    "body": "On the morning of March 14, Emmanuel Macron’s official photographer uploaded a series of photos to her Instagram account showing the French president working the previous day from his gilded Parisian office. In the close-ups, a weary-looking President Macron, 44, sports a conspicuous strip of stubble, beefy mutton-chop sideburns, jeans and a hoodie bearing the logo of “CPA10,” a special forces unit of the French Air Force.<br />Even though it was a Sunday, this was an atypically dressed-down ensemble for President Macron, a politician who has exhibited a conservative fashion sense over the years. During his nearly five years in office, he has rarely been seen in public wearing anything other than a pearly white shirt with a modest spread collar, a navy suit and a coordinating blue tie. Seeing President Macron in his Sunday worst was jarring for those both in and out of France."
