    "body": "WASHINGTON—Enrique Tarrio, a leader of the Proud Boys, has been indicted on conspiracy and other charges related to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, the Justice Department said, alleging he developed plans with other members of the extremist group to storm the building that day.<br />Mr. Tarrio, 38 years old, was arrested in Miami and made a brief appearance Tuesday in federal court in Florida, where prosecutors described him as a danger to the community and said they would seek to extend his detention at a further hearing scheduled for Friday. A judge appointed a public defender after Mr. Tarrio said he had no savings outside of the roughly $400 he makes a week at a new job printing T-shirts."
