    "body": "Amazon.com Inc.  is playing catch-up as tech giants compete to shed more light on the cloud’s carbon footprint.<br />The big three global cloud-computing providers—Amazon Web Services, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and  Microsoft Corp.’s  Azure—are starting to vie for clients that want to measure and reduce their emissions, according to David Mytton, a sustainable-computing researcher at Imperial College London. Until recently, there has been “very limited transparency” on cloud providers’ carbon footprints, he said, adding that Amazon is “quite far behind.”"
