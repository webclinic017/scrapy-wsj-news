    "body": "Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson may not be an originalist, but she sounded like one in her confirmation hearings this week. “I believe that the Constitution is fixed in its meaning,” she said on Tuesday. “I believe that it’s appropriate to look at the original intent, original public meaning, of the words when one is trying to assess because, again, that’s a limitation on my authority to import my own policy.”<br />Even a nominee chosen by a Democratic president and facing a Democratic Senate felt it was necessary to say that she would adhere to the original public meaning of the text. To appreciate the significance of this development requires a bit of history."
