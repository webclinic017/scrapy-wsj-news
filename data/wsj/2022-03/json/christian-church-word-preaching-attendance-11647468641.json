    "body": "Regarding Ron McCoy’s “A Thriving Church Can Save a Faltering One” (Houses of Worship, March 11): My husband and I have been looking for a local church since moving to Houston in 2019. Covid took a toll on our search, but the live-streaming of services has helped us cull our choices. Through technology we’ve been able to visit two or three churches on a given Sunday. There’s no paucity of choices, yet we’re still homeless. Why? Not because of the lack of “appeal, excitement and relevance” that Mr. McCoy believes is the solution to church-shrink. Churches have all that in abundance. In our experience, what they lack is substance.<br />There’s a famine of the hearing of the Word. Preaching is moralistic (do more and try harder, then you’ll get to heaven) and more about the preacher’s ability to tell a good joke and look “relevant” than challenge the heart in the pew. Music is loud and “exciting” and drowns out one’s inner Spirit. “Appealing” programming is hawked like cheap souvenirs, yet the forging of significant relationships is hampered by an overwhelming mass of people."
