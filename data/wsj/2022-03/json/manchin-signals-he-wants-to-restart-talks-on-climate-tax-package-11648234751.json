    "body": "WASHINGTON—Sen. Joe Manchin, a pivotal vote in Democrats’ efforts to pass elements of President Biden’s economic agenda, has indicated in recent days he wants to restart talks soon on a party-line package focused on energy policy, according to people familiar with his private comments.<br />The West Virginia Democrat’s remarks, made in conversations with energy executives and lobbyists, echo his previous public calls for legislation centered on raising taxes, reducing the deficit, lowering drug costs and offering clean- energy incentives. The private comments have bolstered hopes on Capitol Hill and within the Biden administration that Democrats can resurrect pieces of their marquee legislative effort, previously known as “Build Back Better,” which fell apart last year when Mr. Manchin said he would oppose it in the 50-50 Senate."
