    "body": "Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson’s service on a key governing board at Harvard University raises questions about whether, if confirmed, she would have to sit out an early blockbuster case in the high court’s next term about affirmative action in college admissions.<br />The court in its October term is set to consider whether Harvard’s use of race-conscious admissions policies violates federal civil-rights law. In a companion case, the court is considering whether admissions policies at the University of North Carolina violate the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection. Together, the cases, both led by conservative legal activist Edward Blum, give the court an opportunity to decide whether to prohibit the use of race in the admissions process."
