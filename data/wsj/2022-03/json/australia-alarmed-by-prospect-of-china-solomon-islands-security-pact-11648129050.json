    "body": "SYDNEY—Australia expressed alarm at the prospect of one of its closest neighbors falling more under Beijing’s sway after a document circulated online suggesting China and the Solomon Islands are crafting a new security pact.<br />The draft document, titled as a framework agreement on security cooperation, said the Solomon Islands could ask China to send armed police and military personnel to quell unrest, among other missions, including disaster response. It also said the Solomon Islands could allow Chinese naval ships to dock in the country and protect the safety of Chinese citizens and major projects."
