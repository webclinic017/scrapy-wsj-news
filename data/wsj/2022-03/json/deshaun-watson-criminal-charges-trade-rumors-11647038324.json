    "body": "Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson won’t face criminal charges for allegations of sexual misconduct after a grand jury in Harris County, Texas convened on Friday.<br />Watson—who sat out for the entire 2021 season after the allegations surfaced last year—still faces 22 civil lawsuits for sexual misconduct and was deposed for some of those cases on Friday. The lack of criminal charges, however, could begin to clarify his future and may finally open the possibility of trading him."
