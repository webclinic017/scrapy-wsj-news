    "body": "As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine nears its two-week mark, a grim story in three parts is emerging: Russia’s brutality is escalating, Ukraine’s resistance remains inspiring—and the West’s ability to steer events is proving frustratingly limited.<br />Perhaps Ukraine is somehow, miraculously, winning its battle—or perhaps it’s simply losing more slowly than Russian President Vladimir Putin once imagined. Either way, the U.S. and its allies, after responding with surprising speed and unity to impose economic sanctions on Russia, now find themselves trapped between a desire to help Ukraine more on the one hand and a fear of setting off a global conflict with a nuclear-armed tyrant on the other. The West is in danger of landing somewhere between helpless and hopeless."
