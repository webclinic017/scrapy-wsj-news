    "body": "SIMPLE, QUICK AND DELICIOUS, this fish curry, the second Slow Food Fast recipe from Chintan Pandya, has always been one of the chef’s personal favorites. Called meen moilee, it contains a fragrant combination of coconut milk, curry leaves, ginger, green chiles, mustard seeds, tomatoes and a good pinch of turmeric. “I was in Bangalore, and an older gentleman cooked this in a hotel,” Mr. Pandya recalled. “I said, ‘I’m here to learn from you.’ ”<br />As wonderfully uncomplicated as this recipe is, there is a right way to do it. For instance, the spices should be added in the sequence specified. “They burn at different temperatures, which you don’t want, and this order accounts for that,” Mr. Pandya said. One spice in particular defines the dish for him. “This shows off what turmeric, often a supporting ingredient, can do,” he said. “It makes sweet coconut milk more savory and flavorful.”"
