    "body": "WASHINGTON—As Republicans try to influence the Biden administration’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, GOP freshman lawmaker Rep. Victoria Spartz has injected a personal edge into the policy debate.<br />GOP leaders say Ms. Spartz, the only Ukrainian-American member of Congress, has been one of the most effective advocates for escalating efforts to squeeze Moscow and help Kyiv, including a bipartisan push to ban oil-and-gas imports from Russia. The 43-year-old former businesswoman and state senator, who has family and friends still in Ukraine, also wants the U.S. to quickly get more weapons and humanitarian aid to the country."
