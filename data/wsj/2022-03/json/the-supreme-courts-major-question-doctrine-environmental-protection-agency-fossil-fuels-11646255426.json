    "body": "Does the Environmental Protection Agency have the power to eliminate fossil fuels from the U.S. economy without clear authorization from Congress? The Biden Administration on Monday told the Supreme Court it does, and that this isn’t even “a major question.” The Justices should take this as an invitation to more clearly define what they mean by a major question.<br />Presidents of both parties increasingly resort to governing by decree when their agendas are stalled in Congress. Agencies rewrite laws to grant themselves immense powers not specified by Congress. See the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eviction moratorium and Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s vaccine mandate."
