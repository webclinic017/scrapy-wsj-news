    "body": "There may be no better illustration of globalization’s retreat than investors getting burned for owing planes in the wrong place.<br />This week, Moscow claimed that almost 800 commercial aircraft have already been re-registered from Bermuda and Ireland into its own aeronautical records—implying it has appropriated them—in response to the European Union requiring lessors to terminate contracts with Russian airlines by March 28. Western lessors have repatriated only 78 of their jets in Russia, officials said. Roughly 480—worth around $10 billion—are stuck there, according to research firm Ishka."
