    "body": "The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said it would only take action against chief compliance officers when they fail to carry out specific supervisory responsibilities designated by the firm, and not in matters where they play an advisory role.<br />Finra, Wall Street’s self-regulatory arm, in a regulatory note Thursday said that it generally considers the role of compliance chief an advisory position rather than a supervisory one. The responsibility for supervision under Finra rule 3110, which lays out obligations for member firms and requires each to designate individual supervisors for responsibilities, lies with a company’s senior business management and not its compliance officers."
