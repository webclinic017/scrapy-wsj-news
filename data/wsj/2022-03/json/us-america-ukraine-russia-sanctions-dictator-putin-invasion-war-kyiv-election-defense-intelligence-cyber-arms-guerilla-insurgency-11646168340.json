    "body": "With Russian forces in Kyiv, Vladimir Putin is attempting to overthrow the democratically elected Ukrainian government and replace it with a pro-Russian regime. The Biden administration now needs to make clear that it will oppose any Russian-installed government in Kyiv and provide sustained military, economic and other aid to Ukrainian resistance efforts.<br />The U.S. and Europe failed to deter a Russian invasion because sanctions and diplomacy alone do not deter dictators like Mr. Putin. Russia now needs to pay a heavy price for his strategic miscalculation."
