    "body": "The Russian leader continued his ruthless persecution of the Ukrainian people long after the battlefield slaughter officially came to an end. His principal goal was to deny his victims their fundamental right to a legitimate, distinct national identity.<br />That historical summary may eventually apply to Vladimir Putin, but it also describes Peter the Great (1672-1725). The all-powerful czar is Mr. Putin’s personal hero and is credited with transforming a backward and isolated Russia into a feared world power. Understanding Mr. Putin’s admiration for this towering figure (historians estimate he stood at least 6-foot-8) provides context for Russia’s current war against Ukraine."
