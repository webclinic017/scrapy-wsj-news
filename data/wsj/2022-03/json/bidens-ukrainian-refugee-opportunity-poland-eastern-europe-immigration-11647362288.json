    "body": "It’s hard to imagine a bigger contrast in values than Russia’s brutality in Ukraine and Europe’s warm welcome to refugees fleeing the violence. But with millions of arrivals beginning to overwhelm the Continent, the U.S. can do more to help.<br />Some three million refugees have fled Ukraine since Vladimir Putin’s invasion began on Feb. 24, according to the United Nations refugee agency. More than 1.8 million have crossed into Poland and nearly another million to other European Union nations sharing a border with Ukraine. For comparison, the EU received 1.3 million asylum applications during the 2015 migrant wave."
