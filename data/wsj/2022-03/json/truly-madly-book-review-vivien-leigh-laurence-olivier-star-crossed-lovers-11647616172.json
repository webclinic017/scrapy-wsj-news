    "body": "Late in Stephen Galloway’s “Truly, Madly,” a workmanlike and ultimately sorrowful dual biography of Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, comes an anecdote that could stand as a fractal representation of the couple’s relationship, both with each other and with the outside world. The setting is a 1955 performance of Shakespeare’s bloody “Titus Andronicus” at Stratford, with Oliver as the titular Roman general and Leigh as his daughter, Lavinia. He is perhaps the most respected and admired actor on the planet; she is a few years out from winning her second best-actress Oscar, for “A Streetcar Named Desire” (1951). She is also a few months out of Netherne Hospital in Surrey, England, where therapy for her bipolar-induced psychosis included electroshock treatments and nearly three weeks in a medically induced coma.<br />Let Anthony Quayle, who played Aaron the Moor, tell the story: “While Titus was speaking words of love and comfort to poor mutilated Lavinia, [Leigh] would be cursing [Olivier] with the most extreme obscenities imaginable, with a piece of bloody gauze tied over her mouth. The audience could not hear what she was saying or realize that she was speaking at all, but it was perfectly audible to those of us who were there.”"
