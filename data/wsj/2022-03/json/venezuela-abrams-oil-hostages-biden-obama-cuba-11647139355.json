    "body": "Your editorial “Hostages for Oil from Venezuela” (March 10) rightly points out the folly of believing that country’s ruined oil patch can quickly increase exports to the United States. Cuba has first call on Venezuelan oil production, in exchange for the intelligence agents it stations in Caracas to protect Nicolás Maduro and keep his regime in power. Second comes China, to which the Maduro regime sends oil to pay off its billions of dollars in debt.<br />The Biden administration’s outreach to Mr. Maduro has undermined Venezuela’s democratic forces. This is a repeat of President Barack Obama’s Cuba playbook, and today’s administration strategists are many of the same people who drafted it a decade ago. Now as then, the theory is that if we start lifting economic sanctions, a vicious tyranny will allow a democratic opening."
