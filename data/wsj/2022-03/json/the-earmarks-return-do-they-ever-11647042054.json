    "body": "Our email in-boxes are filled with news releases from Members of Congress hailing the passage this week of the $1.5 trillion omnibus spending bill. You’d think it was the 1964 Civil Rights Act or the 1941 Lend-Lease Act for all the self-congratulation. Instead the Members seem proudest of the triumphant return of spending earmarks.<br />Earmarks vanished for a decade after 2011 following the “bridge to nowhere” and other embarrassments. But Democrats last year chose to bring them back, and more than a few Republicans were quietly elated."
