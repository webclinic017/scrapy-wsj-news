    "body": "Mortgage credit availability, a measure of lenders’ willingness to issue home loans, rose in February to its highest level since last May, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.<br />Faced with high prices, rising rates and declining application volumes, lenders are expanding product offerings and relaxing some borrower eligibility requirements. Financing options that allow for bigger loans or lower upfront payments can extend consumers’ purchasing power and cushion the impact of the large price increases of the past two years. Lenders are aiming to boost business to offset shrinking volume and reduced profit margins."
