    "body": "Zoom can’t afford Zoom fatigue. And now, neither can  HP Inc.<br />The maker of PCs and printers is buying videoconferencing gear maker Poly for about $1.7 billion in cash. The deal, which carries a price tag of about $3.3 billion including Poly’s net debt, is the largest HP has undertaken since the split of the Hewlett-Packard conglomerate in 2015. It is a major move even by those standards, considering the only time the old Hewlett-Packard wagered a larger amount on a hardware-focused business was the $23 billion acquisition of PC maker Compaq, which was completed in 2002."
