    "body": "Citigroup  may not yet have investors’ faith in its latest effort at transformation. At least now it should have their attention.<br />Citigroup set a medium-term target of reaching 11% to 12% return on tangible common equity in the next three to five years. For many investors, that will be table stakes, getting back to where it was pre-pandemic and narrowing the gap to peers. The bank’s shares were up about 1.7% on Wednesday. What is more important is how the bank gets to that goal, and whether it represents a durable foundation rather than just a series of moves to hurtle toward a number. So just as important as the bank’s targets on Wednesday were its additional disclosures about its strengths."
