    "body": "A man who became rich and famous pretending to fight space aliens committed a real act of televised violence on Sunday night—and then Hollywood’s finest gave him a standing ovation barely half an hour later. Is it any wonder that much of America has lost all respect for self-referential Hollywood?<br />To catch up those who are blessedly unaware, the comedian Chris Rock was presenting at the Academy Awards and joked about Will Smith’s wife’s hair. She apparently has alopecia, medical hair loss, which Mr. Rock might or might not have known, but many viewers at home probably didn’t. In either case, it was a rude crack, though jokes come with the territory of being famous, and doubtless Mr. Smith has heard worse."
