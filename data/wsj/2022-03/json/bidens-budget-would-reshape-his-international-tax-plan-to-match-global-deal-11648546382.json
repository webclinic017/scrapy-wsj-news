    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden’s proposed 2023 budget changes a key piece of his international tax plan, moving away from a prior, harsher proposal and toward an evolving international standard for enforcing the global minimum-tax agreement.<br />The administration also responded—vaguely—to business complaints about how the proposed 15% global minimum tax could restrict U.S. tax breaks for corporate research, exports and low-income housing. Senior Treasury officials said they want to work with Congress to protect certain domestic incentives from U.S. and foreign minimum taxes."
