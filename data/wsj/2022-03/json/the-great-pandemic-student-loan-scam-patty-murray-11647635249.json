    "body": "President Biden has asked his Justice Department to investigate fraud in pandemic relief programs. Good idea. How about investigating the government’s student loan forbearance, which has cost taxpayers $100 billion and counting? This may be the biggest scam of the pandemic.<br />The Administration’s student-loan payment pause is scheduled to expire on May 1. But this week Washington Sen. Patty Murray urged an extension to 2023 while “forgiving some debt for all borrowers,” especially minorities and lower income earners. “Debt relief shouldn’t require making it through a gauntlet of paperwork,” she declared."
