    "body": "Ukrainians and Jews were trapped in a fateful pattern for centuries. Whenever Ukrainians fought for their independence—against the Poles in 1648, the Soviets in 1919 or the Germans in 1941—Jews were the plunder at their disposal. Bohdan Khmelnytsky figures in Ukrainian history as the George Washington of the nation. He figures in Jewish history as the pogrom killer of thousands. How can a Jewish descendant of Holocaust survivors now be the country’s accepted leader?<br />Our guide to an answer is a native of Odessa, Isaac Babel, one of the boldest writers who ever lived. In 1920, during the first war waged by the newly formed Soviet Union, against Poland over territory that is now Ukraine, Babel served as the embedded correspondent in the First Cavalry army, made up of Zaporizhian Cossacks. His account of that war in the stories of “Red Cavalry” shows why Jews and Ukrainians may be the two peoples readiest to live and die for their freedom—and how their fused spirit lives in Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky."
