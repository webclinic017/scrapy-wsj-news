    "body": "A President’s budget is a declaration of priorities, so it’s worth underscoring that President Biden’s new budget for fiscal 2023 proposes $2.5 trillion in tax increases over 10 years. His priority is taking money from the private economy and giving it to politicians to spend.<br />We told you Tuesday about his new tax on wealth and capital gains even if you don’t sell the asset. That is supposed to raise a cool $361 billion. But there’s so much more."
