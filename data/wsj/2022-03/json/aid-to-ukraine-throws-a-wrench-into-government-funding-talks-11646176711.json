    "body": "WASHINGTON—Talks to finalize legislation funding the government for the remainder of fiscal year 2022 have hit difficulties over aid money for Ukraine, the Senate’s top Republican said, as the country appeals for resources to defend itself from Russian attacks.<br />The crux of the issue is whether President Biden’s request for $6.4 billion in aid to Ukraine would violate an agreement between Democrats and Republicans on overall spending levels for defense and nondefense spending. Republicans complain that Democrats want to provide money for the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development on top of already agreed-to military spending and also want $3.5 billion of Mr. Biden’s request for the Pentagon be subtracted from military spending totals negotiators have already agreed to."
