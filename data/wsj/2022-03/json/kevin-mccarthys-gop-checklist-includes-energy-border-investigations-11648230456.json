    "body": "PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla.—Republicans are backing Rep. Kevin McCarthy as the next speaker of the House if the party wins back control in November. Now, he is crafting a formal plan to try to keep lawmakers united and voters engaged.<br />At House Republicans’ policy retreat at a resort near Jacksonville, the minority leader and other party officials previewed policies they plan to pursue as well as investigations they may launch into people close to President Biden. Mr. McCarthy hopes that a formal agenda—which Republicans spent several days drafting in group discussions—will boost midterm turnout and tamp down any revolts in the ideologically-diverse caucus."
