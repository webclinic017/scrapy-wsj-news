    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Republicans passed a measure backing the termination of the government’s two-year-old emergency declaration on the Covid-19 pandemic, taking advantage of several Democratic absences in the 50-50 chamber.<br />The measure passed Thursday 48-47 along party lines, and it is unlikely that it will get a vote in the Democratic-controlled House. If it were to pass both chambers, the White House promised a veto by President Biden, saying the measure would “abruptly curtail the ability of the Administration to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.”"
