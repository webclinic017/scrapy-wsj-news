    "body": "Regarding your editorial “It’s Joe Biden’s Inflation” (March 11): Press secretary Jen Psaki claims that the Biden administration is in no way opposed to, and has in no way impeded, oil drilling. She backs up this glibness by stating that oil companies have 9,000 leases to drill on tracts of land.<br />What she omits is that only a small percentage of such leases ever become productive wells, even in normal times when the government is supportive. A decision to drill requires extensive geological studies to justify the expense. Many of the lease areas are found not to contain sufficient oil, and given this administration’s hostility to domestic drilling, the financing for those studies and the extraction of oil has dried up."
