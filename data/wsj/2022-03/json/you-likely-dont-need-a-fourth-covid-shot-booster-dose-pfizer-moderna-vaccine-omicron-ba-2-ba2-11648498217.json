    "body": "How many Covid shots are enough?  Pfizer  and  Moderna  have asked the Food and Drug administration to authorize a second booster (a fourth shot) for patients over 65 and all adults, respectively. The FDA reportedly will authorize (but not recommend) the fourth shot for patients over 50. But if your immune system is healthy, three or even two doses of these mRNA vaccines should be sufficient.<br />Vaccine-induced protection against infection is short-lived and doesn’t get much of a boost from extra shots. Yet the initial two-dose regimen is enough to provide most patients excellent protection against severe disease—mediated by durable cellular responses, not the neutralizing antibodies that rise and wane quickly after vaccination."
