    "body": "I would frame President Biden’s approach to Ukraine as zero risk (“The West Must Risk More for Ukraine Now” by Zalmay Khalilzad, op-ed, March 17). Unfortunately, this may enable Vladimir Putin to succeed in taking a calculated risk. I am reminded of what Gen. Ulysses Grant told his generals when he was handed command of the Army of the Potomac:<br />“I am heartily tired of hearing about what Lee is going to do. Some of you always seem to think he is suddenly going to turn a double somersault, and land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time. Go back to your command, and try to think what we are going to do ourselves, instead of what Lee is going to do.”"
