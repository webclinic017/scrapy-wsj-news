    "body": "Collectors find  beauty in the strangest things. Visiting a new friend’s luxurious house in Paris the late French artist Pierre Le-Tan noticed an odd display on the shelves. “They were filled with shapes that at first I had trouble making out since the lighting was dim. This is how I discovered that this courteous and self-effacing man methodically collected crumpled pieces of paper . . . ‘The light and the shadows,’ he once told me.”  A crumpled Post-it was labeled “piece mineur mais charmant” (“minor piece but charming”).<br />In his droll, enchanting book “A Few Collectors.” Le-Tan reflects on 20 obsessive subjects, including himself, and the extraordinary objects they acquired. His elegant profiles (ably translated from the French by Michael Z. Wise) are subtly comic and rather mournful, illustrated in his distinctive style: fine ink cross-hatching and watercolors the pastel shades of French macaroons. The pictures are whimsical and enigmatic, often cropped so things are half-seen and elusive, adding to their mystery. Small drawings—an old key, a Chinese vase, a twist of coral, a terra-cotta eggplant—punctuate the chapters."
