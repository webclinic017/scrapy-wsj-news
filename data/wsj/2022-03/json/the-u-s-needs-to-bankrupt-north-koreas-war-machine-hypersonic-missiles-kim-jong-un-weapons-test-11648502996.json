    "body": "Rocket Man is on another blasting spree. Last week Pyongyang tested a “monster” intercontinental ballistic missile, reportedly designed to strike any spot in the U.S. and overwhelm American missile defenses with multiple warheads. Since the beginning of the year North Korea has conducted more than a dozen launches—including cruise, rail-based, hypersonic and intermediate-range ballistic missiles—as well as an unsuccessful long-range missile test earlier this month. But why now? What does Kim Jong Un want from his sudden fireworks display?<br />The explanations from Washington and Asian capitals for these latest launches sometimes sound like the naive foreign-policy punditry from the 1990s, at the very start of Pyongyang’s methodical march to nuclear status. We hear that the Kim regime is trying to get our attention, for example, or that it is shoring up its domestic legitimacy."
