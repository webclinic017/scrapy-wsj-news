    "body": "WASHINGTON—Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky plans to take his case for more military gear directly to Congress on Wednesday, just as many lawmakers are trying to prod the White House to move more aggressively to repel Russia’s invasion.<br />Mr. Zelensky, whom aides said asked to speak to Congress, has proven to be an effective advocate for Ukraine, arguing publicly and privately for action from the West. The remarks, which will be held via a remote connection in an auditorium inside the Capitol complex, will be distributed to television networks, giving him a platform to address the American public."
