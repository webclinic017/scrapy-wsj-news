    "body": "STREET FOOD is the focus at Chintan Pandya’s fast-casual spot, Rowdy Rooster, which opened in Manhattan three weeks ago. As the name suggests, chicken features prominently. But these potato fritters have been a big hit, too, stuffed into a soft roll and served as a sandwich. “We’ve sold out of them nearly every day,” Mr. Pandya said.<br />Known in India as batata vada, the fritters can also be served as they are here, with a mint chutney for dipping. They begin with a base of spiced mashed potato. For a fluffy texture, use a floury variety, such as russet or Idaho. Formed into balls and coated in a chickpea-flour batter, they crisp beautifully."
