    "sub_head": "Blame it on the supply chain: The rosé vintage we would normally be uncorking now will arrive late. But last year’s excellent vintage has only gotten better, and you can (and should) still find the bottles on wine store shelves.",

    "body": "MANY WINES may sit on store shelves for 12 months or longer. But rosés are marketed as seasonal wines, with the new vintage traditionally replacing the old. For retailers, last year’s rosés are yesterday’s news—except this year, it seems.<br />Since the rosés from the 2021 harvest will be arriving much more slowly this spring, and there are plenty of last spring’s—i.e., 2020’s—pinks still around, I decided to sample some of these “leftover” wines. Could they be just as good or perhaps even better than they were last year?"
