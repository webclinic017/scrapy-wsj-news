    "body": "Yields on shorter-term and longer-term U.S. government bonds have been converging rapidly, stirring fears—along with skepticism—that the bond market is close to signaling a looming recession.<br />Yields, which fall when bond prices rise, have been climbing all year based on expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates. They got another big boost Monday, after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell emphasized that the central bank was prepared to raise rates in half-percentage steps to fight inflation."
