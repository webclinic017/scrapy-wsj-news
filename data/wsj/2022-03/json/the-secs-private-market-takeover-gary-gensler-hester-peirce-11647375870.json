    "body": "The Securities and Exchange Commission’s power has diminished in tandem with public markets since Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act two decades ago. But rather than ease regulatory burdens on public companies, Chairman Gary Gensler is seeking more control over private markets.<br />Congress established the SEC during the Great Depression to oversee public stock exchanges and protect mom-and-pop investors from fraud. After the WorldCom and Enron accounting scandals, Congress gave the agency more power and increased public-company reporting requirements."
