    "body": "LONDON—The British government Thursday became the first Western country to impose sanctions against Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich as it seeks to ratchet up pressure on Kremlin-linked businesspeople.<br />The U.K. government said Thursday the Russian tycoon’s assets would now be frozen and a travel ban imposed. Mr. Abramovich has already said he is in the process of trying to sell his British soccer club Chelsea FC, and a person familiar with his business said he has put his London properties on the market. The U.K. government said that it would provide a special license that would allow Chelsea to continue to operate despite the sanctions."
