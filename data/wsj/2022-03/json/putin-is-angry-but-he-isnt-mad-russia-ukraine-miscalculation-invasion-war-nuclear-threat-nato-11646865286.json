    "body": "Has Vladimir Putin lost his mind? Almost certainly not. He appears to have miscalculated badly in his invasion of Ukraine. But history is laden with aggressors who thought wars would be much easier than they turned out to be. It’s a natural human tendency, especially in dictatorships or juntas. Think of the kaiser and World War I, the Tojo regime leading into World War II, Kim Il Sung in Korea, the Soviets in Afghanistan, Saddam Hussein against Iran and Kuwait.<br />The U.S. has done it too. Before the March 2003 invasion of Iraq, some officials predicted that two-thirds of our invading forces would be home by fall and that the war would cost no more than $100 billion. We wound up deploying 130,000 to 170,000 U.S. troops for roughly seven more years. The war ultimately cost well over $1 trillion and the lives of 4,500 brave Americans."
