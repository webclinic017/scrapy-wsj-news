    "body": "DUBAI—A global watchdog censured the United Arab Emirates for not doing enough in confronting money laundering and terrorism financing activities, adding it to a list of countries requiring increased monitoring, in a blow to the Middle East nation’s image as a safe business and investment hub.<br />The Financial Action Task Force, a Paris-based intergovernmental body that audits the ability of nations to detect and disrupt illicit finance, on Friday clubbed the U.A.E. with 22 other countries, including Pakistan, Syria and Nicaragua, in a so-called gray list of jurisdictions that are deemed deficient but working with the FATF to improve. Zimbabwe was removed from the list."
