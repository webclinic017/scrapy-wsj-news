    "body": "“Literature knows no frontiers and must remain common currency among people in spite of political or international upheavals.” So states the PEN Charter, a manifesto that guides an international movement of authors dedicated to defending the freedom to write. The Charter was adopted in 1948, alongside the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a dawning moment for the liberal international system. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attack on Ukraine has not only rattled that system but also challenged the position of arts and literature as an international common denominator. Cultural organizations have felt impelled not simply to proclaim solidarity with Ukraine but also to draw up bridges, curtailing engagement with Russian artists.<br />Cultural outlets owe patrons, partners and audiences a conscientious response to international violence, mindful of how their decisions can shape perceptions, inflame passions and play into political agendas. The impulse to stigmatize and disavow all things Russian is an understandable reaction to brazen aggression; it is a gesture of solidarity with besieged counterparts. But a wholesale boycott spanning music, theater, art, films and books—and their creators—risks compounding the authoritarianism and dehumanization that it intends to protest."
