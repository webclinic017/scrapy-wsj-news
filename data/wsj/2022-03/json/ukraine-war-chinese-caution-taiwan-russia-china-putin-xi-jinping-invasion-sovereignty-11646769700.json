    "body": "Beijing should be drawing some important lessons from Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. Though there are big differences between Ukraine and Taiwan, there are important similarities. Like Vladimir Putin’s view of Ukraine, Xi Jinping denies that Taiwan possesses any territorial or political sovereignty. As Mr. Putin saw Ukraine’s growing democratic resilience and ties with the West as a threat to his regime, so does Beijing fear a robust and democratic Taiwan roughly 100 miles off its shoreline that is bolstering relations with the U.S. and its allies. And both Russia and China can field impressive-looking militaries, particularly compared with their targets’ forces.<br />As Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine enters its third bloody week, how will the war affect Beijing’s ambition of subjugating Taiwan? China should take several lessons from Mr. Putin’s ill-advised aggression."
