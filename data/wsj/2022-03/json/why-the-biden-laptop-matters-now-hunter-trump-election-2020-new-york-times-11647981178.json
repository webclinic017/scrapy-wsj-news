    "body": "I’ve been wondering when our media, at least those with a long-term hope of authority, would begin clawing back from their Russia collusion disgrace. The answer turns out to be: “When Vladimir Putin starts World War III in Ukraine.”<br />Russia and China are coming together now not because of oil and gas but because they have a common enemy, the democratic idea. I’m not being pious here. The only real threat either nuclear-armed regime faces is from its own people in a Tiananmen-style uprising. Russia is openly fascist, China is becoming so. A third giant power on the Eurasian continent, India, is at risk of evolving in the same direction."
