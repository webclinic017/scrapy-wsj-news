    "body": "Conventional wisdom has it that Beijing miscalculated by supporting Vladimir Putin’s Ukraine war. Xi Jinping’s partner faces both unexpectedly fierce resistance from the Ukrainian military and surprisingly strong Western punishment. Some in Washington expect China to attempt to extricate itself by brokering a peace deal. This is unlikely to happen. In many ways China has benefitted from the conflict, as Russia tests the international system with disappointing results for the West.<br />True, Beijing is taken aback by Russian military failures. The war will surely lead Mr. Xi to question his military’s ability to attack Taiwan. Yet Mr. Xi has long heralded a new era in international relations that overturns the U.S.-made world order. Mr. Putin signed on to this agenda in the Chinese-Russian Joint Statement of Feb. 4. From Beijing’s perspective, a new international politics is emerging."
