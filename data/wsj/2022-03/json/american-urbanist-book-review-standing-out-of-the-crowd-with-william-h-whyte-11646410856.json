    "body": "In 1935, a senior at the fledgling St. Andrew’s School in Delaware applied to Princeton University. His grades were terrible, almost all Ds in his final term. But the headmaster rated the applicant an ”unusually good” student, describing him as “a brilliant & versatile boy who has made a special contribution to the School from the funds of his particular genius.” The student’s problem, he said, wasn’t a lack of scholarly prowess but an astonishing array of distracting extracurricular activities.<br />“Hollingsworth Whyte,” the headmaster concluded, “is an unusually brilliant boy whose temperament is such that he can scarcely be classified in the ordinary way.” The boy with the D-laden transcript joined the Princeton class of 1939."
