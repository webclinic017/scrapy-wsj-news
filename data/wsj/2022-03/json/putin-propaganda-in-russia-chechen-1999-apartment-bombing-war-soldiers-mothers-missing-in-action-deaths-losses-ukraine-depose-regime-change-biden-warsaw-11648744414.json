    "body": "President Biden has called for Vladimir Putin to be removed from power. But only Russians can remove Mr. Putin. That is why, in addition to supplying arms to Ukraine, the U.S. needs to take steps to reach the Russian people.<br />Mr. Putin understands that to prevail in Ukraine he must maintain the support of the Russian public. He uses state television to inundate Russians with reports of supposed atrocities by U.S.-backed Ukrainian Nazis against ethnic Russians, particularly in the Donetsk and Luhansk republics which the Russian army is said to be defending."
