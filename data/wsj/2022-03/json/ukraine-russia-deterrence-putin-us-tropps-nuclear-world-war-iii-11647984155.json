    "body": "In “Why Deterrence Failed in Ukraine” (op-ed, March 21), Nadia Schadlow regrets that President Biden ruled out the use of U.S. military force to stop the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a country of little strategic value to the U.S. but of enormous strategic value to Russia. She thinks Mr. Biden could have bluffed Vladimir Putin by putting U.S. combat troops in Ukraine before Russia invaded. On the contrary, such an intervention would have confirmed Mr. Putin’s worst fears about American designs on Ukraine, and run a huge risk of igniting a larger war or even a nuclear conflagration. There could hardly be a more dangerous policy prescription.<br />Courtenay McAlpin"
