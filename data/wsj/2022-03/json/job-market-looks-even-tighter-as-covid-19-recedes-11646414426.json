    "body": "The combination of falling Covid-19 cases and rising opportunities is drawing more people back into the job market. That doesn’t mean it is getting easier for companies to hire.<br />The Labor Department on Friday said that the economy added 678,000 jobs in February—better than the 440,000 economists expected to see. The unemployment rate slipped to 3.8% from January’s 4%. This occurred even as the labor-force participation rate—the share of the working-age population working or seeking work—rose to 62.3% from 62.2%."
