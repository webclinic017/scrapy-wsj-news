The West is united, suddenly and surprisingly, and that feels good too.<br />Volodymyr Zelensky stirred the world not only by what he said but what he did. He has put it all on the line, including his life. Early on he told the press the intelligence services had informed him he is Russian target No. 1, his wife and two children target No. 2, but they’re staying, they won’t leave. It is reminiscent of the summer of 1940 and London bracing for the blitz. Prime Minister Winston Churchill, asked if the children of the British royal family, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret, shouldn’t be sent to safety overseas. This was the answer of Queen Elizabeth, wife of King George VI: “The children could not go without me, I could not possibly leave the king, and the king would never go.” So they stayed. Princess Elizabeth has been queen now for 70 years."
