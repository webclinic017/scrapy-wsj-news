    "body": "Russia’s last few remaining independent-minded media outlets were taken off the air this week in a public feud over reporting on Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine after the country’s prosecutor general said the stations were misleading the Russian public and spreading lies.<br />Both Ekho Moskvy, a long staple of independent journalism, and TV Rain, which gained prominence during mass antigovernment protests that shook Russia a decade ago, said access to their sites had been blocked by the country’s communications censor, known as Roskomnadzor."
