    "body": "Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos Inc., was found guilty Jan. 3 on four counts of criminal fraud against investors. She was acquitted on four counts tied to patients. The jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on the remaining three counts tied to investors.<br />On Jan. 12, the federal judge overseeing Ms. Holmes’s case scheduled her sentencing hearing for Sept. 26. She will remain out of prison until at least that time with a $500,000 bond secured by property owned by her parents—an apartment on Wisconsin Avenue in Washington, D.C., according to public records."
