    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden’s effort to use his first State of the Union address to revive his stalled domestic economic agenda before Congress appeared to fall short as a key Democrat remained unmoved by the president’s appeal.<br />In his speech Tuesday, Mr. Biden made the case for parts of his proposed $2 trillion Build Back Better agenda as a potential tool to drive down inflation, reduce the deficit and spur economic growth. But the president’s pitch did little to persuade Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), whose lack of support for the legislation has halted its passage on Capitol Hill and frustrated progressive Democrats."
