    "body": "A federal judge is set to hold a rare hearing Tuesday to consider whether one of the jurors who convicted Ghislaine Maxwell of sex trafficking was untruthful on a jury-selection form, which defense attorneys argue merits a new trial.<br />The hearing in Manhattan federal court will focus on whether the unidentified male juror made a false statement on a screening questionnaire when asked if he was a victim of sex abuse. The juror answered no, but later told news outlets in post-trial interviews that he was a sex-abuse survivor and used his experience to sway other jurors during deliberations."
