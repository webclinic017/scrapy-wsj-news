    "body": "Critics have claimed that cryptocurrency will help Russia evade sanctions, or at best that it’s of no use to Ukrainians. In fact, it’s proving to be a powerful tool to help them.<br />I’ve worked in the blockchain industry for four years, and I’m Ukrainian. I grew up and attended university in Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine and one of the hardest-hit by Russian bombs. I’m one of several organizers of Unchain Fund, a crypto fundraising project dedicated to relief in Ukraine that has raised more than $6.9 million so far, as well as Away from Ukraine, an information network for displaced Ukrainians."
