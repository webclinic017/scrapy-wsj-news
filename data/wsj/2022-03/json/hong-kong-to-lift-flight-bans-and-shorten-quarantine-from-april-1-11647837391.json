    "body": "HONG KONG—The city’s top official announced that Hong Kong would scrap flight bans from countries including the U.S. and shorten quarantines for returning residents to seven days, a highly anticipated move that responds to concerns of business groups.<br />On Monday, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said fully vaccinated Hong Kong residents would need to conduct Covid-19 tests every day while in hotel quarantine and be allowed to leave if their tests were negative after seven days. Previously, most overseas arrivals faced 14 days of mandatory quarantine, which was shortened from three weeks last month."
