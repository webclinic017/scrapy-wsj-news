    "body": "The war in Ukraine has added urgency to the Biden administration’s monthslong search for new oil supplies, as it seeks to contain surging energy prices through talks at home and diplomacy abroad with friends and foes alike.<br />The rush to fill gaps from Russia’s rapidly shrinking contribution to the global energy markets has led the White House to oil-rich nations in the Middle East, countries under U.S. sanctions and private-sector oil giants meeting this week in Houston. But the quest has been complicated by several factors, including President Biden’s vow to take a tougher line against Saudi Arabia over human-rights abuses, domestic political pressure and post-pandemic supply chain disruptions."
