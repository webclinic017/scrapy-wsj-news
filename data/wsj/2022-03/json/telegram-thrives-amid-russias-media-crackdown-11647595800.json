    "body": "Russia’s campaign to restrict access to Twitter, Facebook and other sources of uncensored information on its invasion of Ukraine has skipped one crucial platform: the social media and chat app Telegram.<br />Anyone in Russia who wanted to follow Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s address to Congress on Wednesday could find it on Telegram, along with images of Russia bombing civilian areas in Ukraine. Users are decamping en masse to Telegram from banned apps like  Meta Platforms Inc.’s  Instagram as well as others that are under threat of being blocked, like  Alphabet Inc.’s  YouTube."
