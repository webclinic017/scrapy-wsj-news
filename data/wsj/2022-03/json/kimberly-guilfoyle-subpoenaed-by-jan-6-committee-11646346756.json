    "body": "WASHINGTON—The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol has subpoenaed records and testimony from Kimberly Guilfoyle, a top fundraising official on the 2020 Trump campaign and the fiancée of Donald Trump Jr.<br />The committee’s chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D., Miss.), said in a statement that the panel was seeking records and testimony from Ms. Guilfoyle because she had met with former President Donald Trump inside the White House on Jan. 6, spoke at a “Stop the Steal” rally that day and allegedly helped fundraise for the event and organize it."
