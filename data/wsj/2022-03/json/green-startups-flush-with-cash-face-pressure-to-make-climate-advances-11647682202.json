    "body": "Green startups hit the lottery last year. Investors have turned cautious since then, putting added pressure on the cash-rich companies to deliver better batteries, more sustainable materials and zippy electric cars.<br />About 1,200 privately held green startups raised a record $45 billion last year, roughly double the previous yearâ€™s total, according to PitchBook. Companies tied to sustainability raised just as much by going public on U.S. stock markets, giving the once-capital-starved industry a $90 billion war chest."
