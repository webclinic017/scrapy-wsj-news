    "body": "ISTANBUL—Israel’s President Isaac Herzog flew to Turkey on Wednesday on the first such high-level visit in more than a decade amid deepening efforts by Ankara to repair relations with its Middle East rivals.<br />Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan invited his Israeli counterpart to the country as part of a broad attempt to restore ties with former opponents, including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. He has sought to ease Ankara’s relative diplomatic isolation in the region while also seeking investments to help the country’s economy, which is still reeling from a currency crisis that wiped as much as 45% off the value of the Turkish lira last year."
