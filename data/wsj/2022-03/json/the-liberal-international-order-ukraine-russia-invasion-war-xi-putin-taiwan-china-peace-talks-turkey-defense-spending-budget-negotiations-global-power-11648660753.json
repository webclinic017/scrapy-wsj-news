    "body": "Until Russia invaded Ukraine, much of the Western elite imagined that we lived in a “rules-based world order.” As Russia’s brutal aggression rudely reminded us, that beautiful aspiration is not reality. Yet there is hope amid the heartbreaking carnage in Ukraine that one nation’s valiant struggle for survival may bring a rules-based world order closer to realization.<br />The idea of a peaceful world resting on just rules has historical antecedents going back hundreds of years. But its formulation as a practical program for modern statecraft began in 1918 with President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points, the platform on which the U.S. entered World War I. With that decision, America, having built the world’s largest, most dynamic economy, entered the global arena."
