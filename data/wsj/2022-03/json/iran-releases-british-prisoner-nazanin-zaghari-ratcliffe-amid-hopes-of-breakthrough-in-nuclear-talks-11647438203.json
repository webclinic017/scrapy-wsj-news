    "body": "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British national who was imprisoned in Iran in 2016, left the country on Wednesday, according to Iranian state media and the British government, as Tehran moves closer to reviving the 2015 nuclear deal with the U.S. and other world powers.<br />The release of Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, and a second British national Anousheh Ashouri, is a sign that an agreement to return to the nuclear deal is likely imminent. Their departure from Iran will fuel hope in the U.S. that four American citizens held in Iran will also be released soon."
