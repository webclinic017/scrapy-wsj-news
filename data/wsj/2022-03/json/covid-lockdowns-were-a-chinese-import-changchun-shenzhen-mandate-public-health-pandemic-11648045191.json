    "body": "China this month reimposed harsh lockdowns on tens of millions of citizens in its relentless quest for “zero Covid.” In Changchun and Shenzhen, only one person per household is permitted to go out, every other day, for essential supplies.<br />The steps come two years after much of the U.S. followed China’s lockdown lead. California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the first statewide U.S. stay-at-home order on March 19, 2020. All U.S. states and most other countries have long since abandoned lockdowns as oppressive, ineffective and exorbitantly expensive. But why did free countries adopt such a strategy to begin with?"
