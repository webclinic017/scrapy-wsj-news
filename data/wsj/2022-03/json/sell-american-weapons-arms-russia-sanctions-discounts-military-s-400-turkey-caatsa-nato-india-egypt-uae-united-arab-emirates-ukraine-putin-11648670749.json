    "body": "Arms exports are a key source of revenue for Russia, typically second only to oil and gas exports, and the war in Ukraine has jeopardized that revenue stream. Russia’s arms sales have slumped in recent years, and the combination of Western sanctions and Russia’s poor performance in Ukraine won’t help. The U.S. can use this opportunity to lure partners away from Russian arms and begin to box Russia out of strategic markets. But it must change its approach.<br />America’s most notable attempt to dissuade countries from buying Russian arms was the bipartisan 2017 Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, known by the acronym Caatsa, which included a directive to impose sanctions on nations that engage in a “significant transaction” with Russia’s defense or intelligence sectors. Penalties entail a range of financial restrictions, including on exports and loans as well as on banking transactions with U.S. institutions. A later amendment gave the president authority to issue waivers in specific instances. Caatsa sanctions were invoked against Turkey after Ankara took possession of the Russian S-400 air-defense systems in 2020. Turkey, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization member, was subsequently kicked out of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program for its deal with Russia."
