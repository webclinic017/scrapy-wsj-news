    "body": "Friday-afternoon news dumps are always revealing, and that includes last week’s Treasury Department clarification of U.S. sanctions on Russian banks. Don’t buy the Biden administration’s line that it’s pulling out the stops against Russia.<br />The president continues to insist he’s “enforcing the most significant package of economic sanctions in history” against Vladimir Putin’s regime. Some Biden loyalists are even veering toward hagiography. Connecticut’s Chris Murphy bragged last week on the Senate floor that Mr. Biden’s “stunning” diplomacy had produced “a sanctions package that is sweeping, that is unprecedented, that is breaking the back of the Russian economy.” The press nods along."
