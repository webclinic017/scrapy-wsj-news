    "body": "The term “side hustle” sounds almost illicit—like Walter White’s secret crystal-meth business in “Breaking Bad”—but it is actually both common and respectable. The real high might lie in the stock market.<br />A survey from web-automation company Zapier found that as of December 2020 one in three Americans had a side hustle—a job in addition to their full-time work—and that about a quarter planned to start one in 2021. Side gigs aren’t new but have been gaining in popularity, especially with younger people. A survey from Lending Tree found millennials the most likely demographic to have one, with half reporting a side hustle as of 2020, followed closely by Gen Z at 46%."
