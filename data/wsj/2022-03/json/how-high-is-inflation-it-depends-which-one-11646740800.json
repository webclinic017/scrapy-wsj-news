    "body": "The inflation numbers that people pay the most attention to and the inflation numbers that the Federal Reserve cares about aren’t the same. In the months ahead, those differences could really matter.<br />Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expect Thursday’s consumer inflation report from the Labor Department will show that overall prices in February rose by 7.8% from a year earlier, their biggest gain since January 1982. Core prices, which exclude food and energy items in an attempt to better capture inflation’s trend, are expected to show a 6.4% rise, which would be the biggest gain since August 1982."
