    "body": "EVEN CASUAL fashion watchers are aware that Hermès Birkin bags and rare sneakers such as special-edition Air Force 1s go for big bucks on the resale market and auction block. But can investing in clothes be lucrative too? Matthew Eberhart, VP of marketing at resale platform Grailed, says yes—provided you “don’t get ketchup stains or rips on your clothes.” While you’ll occasionally see Birkin-level returns on items like a vintage Raf Simons bomber jacket, Mr. Eberhart said most of his customers look at resale as “a conduit to an endless closet” and sell past purchases they’ve literally or stylistically outgrown in order to fund a refreshed wardrobe.<br />Being a smart reseller means knowing when to sell—and when not to. Sasha Skoda, head of women’s at consignment platform the  RealReal ,  noted that party dresses are selling well. “People are wanting to get back out there, make big statements and have a lot of fun,” she said. Similarly, Sofia Bernardin, founder of luxury vintage and second-hand platform Re-See, has observed demand for slinky, 2000s-era Tom Ford and John Galliano dresses. Also worth selling right now? Vivienne Westwood corsets, vintage Jean Paul Gaultier and pretty much anything that embodies Y2K or “Euphoria” style."
