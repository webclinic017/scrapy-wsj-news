    "body": "Sweden-based financial-services company Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB said it would permit some of its funds to buy shares of weapons makers and defense companies, reversing a position it adopted just a year ago as part of its commitment to investing based on environmental, social and governance principles.<br />SEB will from April 1 allow six out of its more than 100 funds to invest in companies that generate more than 5% of their revenue from the defense business. SEB announced the change in its sustainability report on Tuesday and listed the funds that will be allowed to invest in defense companies."
