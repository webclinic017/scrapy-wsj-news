    "body": "In addition to making sure that all Americans pay something in the form of taxes to have “some skin in the game” (“Why I’m Defying Beltway Cowardice” by Rick Scott, op-ed, March 4), might I suggest the senator consider a change in the country’s withholding policy?<br />While working at the Treasury Department during World War II, Milton Friedman urged the federal government to withhold taxes from workers’ compensation. Withholding greatly aided the government in paying for the war but, once established, it was impossible to displace. Friedman concluded later in life that his hand in the process was one of the greatest regrets of his professional life. Withholding has made many U.S. citizens largely insensitive to the greediness of the federal government."
