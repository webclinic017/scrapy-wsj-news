    "body": "Russia’s space agency, Roscosmos, has moved to ease concerns in the U.S. that it might abruptly scuttle its longstanding involvement with the International Space Station in response to the imposition of U.S. and international sanctions against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.<br />“Roscosmos has never let anybody doubt its reliability as a partner,” the space agency said in a statement published Monday by the state-owned Russian news agency Tass. A U.S. astronaut now aboard the station would return to Earth aboard a Russian capsule as scheduled on March 30, according to the Tass report."
