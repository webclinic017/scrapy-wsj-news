    "body": "Missing from the sorry list of American military shortfalls in your editorial “U.S. Defense After Ukraine” (March 8) is perhaps the most worrisome of all: Our continuing inability to fund the long-overdue modernization of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Endlessly entangled in arguments over cost—it grows more expensive the longer we wait—and progressive politicians’ disdain for nuclear weapons, the American land-based ICBM force is at or near the end of its life.<br />This couldn’t occur at a worse time. Russia, with a gross domestic product a fraction of ours, has completed a 12-yearlong effort that has left it with the world’s largest and most modern nuclear arsenal. China appears to be engaged in a “sprint to parity” to match U.S. land-based ICBM numbers."
