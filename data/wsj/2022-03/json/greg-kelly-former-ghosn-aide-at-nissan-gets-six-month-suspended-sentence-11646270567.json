    "body": "TOKYO—Former  Nissan Motor Co.  executive Greg Kelly was found guilty of helping former Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn evade Japan’s pay-disclosure laws during one fiscal year, but the Tokyo District Court cleared him of other charges and gave him a suspended sentence, meaning he probably won’t have to serve prison time.<br />The court found Mr. Kelly guilty in connection with Nissan’s financial report for the fiscal year ending March 2018, but said he wasn’t guilty of wrongdoing on other Nissan reports stretching back nearly a decade. The ruling amounted to a rejection of much of the Japanese prosecutors’ case."
