    "body": "In case you missed it amid the war news, former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan was indicted Wednesday on 22 counts of racketeering and bribery. Illinois Democrats deposed their longtime boss last year, but it took a village to build his corrupt political machine.<br />The 106-page indictment describes myriad schemes by Mr. Madigan, state House Speaker for 36 years and Democratic Party chairman for 23, to enrich himself and his allies. According to the indictment, he tapped his close friend Michael McClain, a co-defendant, to run the “Madigan enterprise” day-to-day."
