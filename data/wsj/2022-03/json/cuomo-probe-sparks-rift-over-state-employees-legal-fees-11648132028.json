    "body": "When former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was under investigation last year for sexual harassment, his administration pledged to cover legal expenses for employees who testified in the probe. But the current administration has concluded the former governor’s promise was legally invalid, leaving a trail of unpaid legal bills hanging over state workers and their lawyers.<br />Now, state officials are trying to find a way out of the thicket, the latest fallout from a series of probes that culminated in Mr. Cuomo’s resignation."
