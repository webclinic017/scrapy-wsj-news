    "body": "Not even  Snowflake  can compete with itself sometimes.<br />The cloud-software company was considered a hot property on its listing in September 2020 and has remained so ever since. Demand for its data-warehousing software used by enterprises to speed up their business-analytics abilities has kept growth off the charts. Revenue more than doubled on a year-over-year basis over the previous nine quarters ahead of Snowflakeâ€™s fourth-fiscal-quarter results Wednesday. Its latest report kept up the trend: Revenue surged 101% to about $384 million."
