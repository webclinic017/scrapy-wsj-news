    "body": "PERHAPS GIVEN THE storied location, it was only a matter of time. One of the world’s oldest and best-known tourist destinations is suddenly packed with 21st-century allure. Istanbul—formerly known as Constantinople, itself formerly known as Byzantium, itself formerly known as Lygos—has a new layer to its renowned palimpsest.<br />In July, Fatih Tutak—a chef who has worked at some of the world’s top restaurants, including Noma in Copenhagen and Nihonryori in Tokyo—reopened his buzzy modernist restaurant Turk in the trendy Bomonti neighborhood (it debuted just before the pandemic). In August, a  Mandarin Oriental  opened on the Bosphorus, the epic waterway that divides the city’s European and Asian sides. On the opposite shore a power plant in the Kadıköy district has been converted into an arts complex called Müze Gazhane, or Gasworks Museum, which bundles an array of museums (one dedicated to climate, another to comics), performance spaces and art exhibits. In September, in Galata, one of the oldest parts of the city, the École St. Pierre hotel arrived on the scene as a stylish conversion of a 180-year-old French school that includes some 13th-century city walls."
