    "body": "The Boy Scouts of America’s plan for resolving 82,200 claims of childhood sexual abuse is being opposed by some insurance companies that worry some victims’ claims may not be worth as much as what the youth group says they are.<br />Several liability insurers have said the Boy Scouts’ chapter 11 plan pegs the value of abuse claims at higher levels than what victims likely would get in state-court lawsuits or private negotiations, and that those estimates could be used by victims to extract more money from them."
