Facebook  got a new name and a new mission.  Peloton Interactive  and  Twitter  got new chiefs.  Pinterest ,   Poshmark ,   Zoom Video Communications ,   Rent the Runway ,   Stitch Fix ,   Uber  and  DoorDash  are just a few of a slew of names adding verticals to bolster growth. Meanwhile  IAC/InterActiveCorp ,   Just Eat Takeaway.com ’s  Grubhub and  Zillow Group  are examples of platforms paring down in hopes of trading up. They are all betting their new story will be just as seductive as the narrative that put them on the map."
