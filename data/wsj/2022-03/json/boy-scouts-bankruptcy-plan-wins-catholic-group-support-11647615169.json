    "body": "Boy Scouts of America won support for its sex-abuse compensation plan from a group of Catholic dioceses, leaving a consortium of insurers as a final major holdout to its proposed chapter 11 reorganization to end its bankruptcy.<br />The deal with a committee that includes a Catholic insurer and roughly 10 archdioceses and dioceses comes in the middle of a two-week trial for the youth organization’s $2.7 billion compensation plan for more than 82,200 abuse victims, the largest such settlement in U.S. history."
