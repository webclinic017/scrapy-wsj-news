    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden will deliver his first State of the Union address Tuesday, as he seeks to tamp down a war in Ukraine, guide the U.S. and its economy through the Covid-19 pandemic, and help buoy Democrats in November’s midterm elections.<br />The president will juggle reframing his stalled legislative agenda with reminding Americans of what he sees as key accomplishments—such as the passage of his Covid-19 relief bill and bipartisan infrastructure legislation last year—and rallying them behind his strategy to counter Russia, which includes uniting with allies on a massive sanctions package."
