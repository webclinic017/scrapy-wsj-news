    "body": "Idaho Republican Gov. Brad Little on Wednesday signed into law a bill that bans abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy and vests enforcement powers with private citizens instead of government officials, even as he expressed reservations about the legislation.<br />With the governor’s signature, Idaho becomes the first state to follow a novel Texas law that severely curtailed abortions in that state."
