    "body": "Beijing for many years played down whatever ambitions China harbors to become a great power, and the past three weeks have shown why. President Xi Jinping, in one of his boldest strategic moves, cast his lot with Russian President Vladimir Putin before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Xi now finds himself embroiled in a global uproar that will be neither easy nor cheap for China. It deserves the global scorn it is receiving.<br />Messrs. Xi and Putin in early February declared their friendship has “no limits,” and Mr. Xi is honoring that pledge. While Beijing makes half-hearted bows toward neutrality in the war, Mr. Xi has exerted no pressure on Mr. Putin to stop it. China’s propaganda on Ukraine has a decided pro-Russia, anti-American tone. Beijing is resisting sanctions on Russia (as much as its banks can without jeopardizing their access to dollars). It may yet supply arms to Russia to support the war."
