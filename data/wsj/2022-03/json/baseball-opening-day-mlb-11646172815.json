    "body": "JUPITER, Fla.—The first two series of the Major League Baseball regular season have been canceled after owners and locked-out players failed to agree on a new labor contract ahead of a management-imposed deadline. Opening day had been scheduled for March 31.<br />“We worked hard to avoid an outcome that’s bad for our fans, bad for our players and bad for our clubs,” MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said. “I want to assure our fans that our failure to reach an agreement was not due to a lack of effort by either party.”"
