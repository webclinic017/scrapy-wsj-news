    "body": "IN THE CLASSIC 1960s film, “Once a Thief,” a character is framed for murder via a simple device: his beloved shearling coat. Knowing that Eddie Pedak (French actor Alain Delon) is always wrapped in his fleece-lined outerwear, his brother’s crooked cronies arrange for a gangster to commit a bloody crime wearing an identical shag. Detectives assume it was Eddie wielding the gun, and chaos ensues in this San Francisco crime caper.<br />But the jacket is also a force for good. Eddie is an ex-con turned family man who’s trying to leave his shady past behind and, before it embroils him in tragic intrigue, the classic suede, caramel-and-cream coat by British tannery Owen Barry conveys respectability and affluence. Indeed, when Eddie buttons it up over a shirt and tie, he looks like he’s cosplaying as a law partner."
