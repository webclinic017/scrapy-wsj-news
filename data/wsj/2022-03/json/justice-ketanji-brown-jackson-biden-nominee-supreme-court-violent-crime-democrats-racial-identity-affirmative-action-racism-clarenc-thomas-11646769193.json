    "body": "Joe Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991 when President George H.W. Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. Mr. Biden accused Bush of putting racial identity ahead of qualifications: “Had Thomas been white, he never would have been nominated. The only reason he’s on the court is because he’s black.” Now the shoe is on the other foot.<br />If Sen. Biden could only speculate about the Thomas nomination, no such speculation is needed concerning President Biden’s choice of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to fill the seat being vacated by Justice Stephen Breyer. Two years ago, while running for president, Mr. Biden announced that his first nominee to the court would be a black woman. No whites (or men) need apply."
