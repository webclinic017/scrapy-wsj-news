    "body": "Despite listing several errors by President Biden in “Zelensky Defines Courage in Our Time” (op-ed, March 17), Karl Rove concludes that “Mr. Biden has handled the crisis well.” I disagree. Mr. Rove neglects to mention the press conferences where Mr. Biden intimated that a minor incursion by Russia would be OK, that we should wait a month to see how the initial set of sanctions go and that sanctions were never intended to deter Russia from an invasion, even though that was his administration’s position for months on end.<br />Mr. Biden has been behind Europe and Congress in sanctioning Russia, cutting off oil purchases, etc. His handling of the potential delivery of MiG-29s to assist Ukraine in air defense has been weak and confusing. A better approach would have been to keep that discussion classified and make the decision without broadcasting it to the world."
