    "body": "This has been quite a week. The Russian invasion of Ukraine ended the post-Cold War era and silenced the endless chatter that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is obsolete. And for Germany, World War II is finally over.<br />The changes in German policy have come with breathtaking speed. Better known for caution than daring, Chancellor Olaf Scholz halted Nord Stream 2 (probably for good), ended Germany’s ban on weapons exports to Ukraine, accepted financial sanctions on Russia—including the removal of some Russian banks from the Swift system and a ban on transactions with Russia’s central bank—and authorized the construction of two new liquefied-natural-gas terminals to reduce his country’s dependence on Russian energy permanently. Germany also supported the European Union’s unprecedented decision to finance the purchase of weapons for Ukraine."
