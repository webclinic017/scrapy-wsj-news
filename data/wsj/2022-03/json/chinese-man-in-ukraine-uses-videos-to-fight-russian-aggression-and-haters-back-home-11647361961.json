Instead of fleeing, he is posting videos from Odessa in what he calls a two-front battle: against the Russian invasion on one side, and against his own compatriots back home on the other.<br />To the Russians, he has called for peace and expressed solidarity with Ukrainians, lambasting the Russians for attacking civilians. “What sins did the little girl in my neighborhood do beyond not finishing school work?” he said in a video this month."
