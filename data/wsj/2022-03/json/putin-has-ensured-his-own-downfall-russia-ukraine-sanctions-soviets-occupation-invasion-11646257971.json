    "body": "Vladimir Putin believes he is resurrecting Russia from the ashes of the Soviet Union. He has established an organized state with vast oil wealth, $635 billion in cash reserves, a largely autonomous economy, and a new and historic strategic accord with China.<br />Through his aggressive record of Russian intelligence interference in Western politics, this spymaster president has honed his covert-action playbook. Whether through Moscow-incubated separatist movements, oligarch-funded mercenaries, false-flag attacks, cyberattacks or propaganda, Mr. Putin has many tools to subjugate Ukraine. A robust dark-money network, likely owned in large part by Mr. Putin, funnels capital into the hands of Russian oligarchs, blunting the effectiveness of Western sanctions. With these factors in his favor, Mr. Putin believes now is his moment to reclaim a lost jewel in Russia’s imperial crown, cementing his historical legacy."
