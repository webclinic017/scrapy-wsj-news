    "body": "Western nations are moving quicker than anyone might have imagined to boycott Russian energy exports, starting with the U.S. and U.K. Europeans are dragging their feet, though oil and gas don’t necessarily need to be treated the same. On oil, their position is becoming academic with markets already turning away from Russian crude because of financial sanctions and reputational risk.<br />But here’s a better wrinkle: Tell Russian producers we’ll take their oil and escrow the payment. Mr. Putin will certainly balk at first but a strong argument says he should continue to deliver hydrocarbons if the alternative is shutting down his industry."
