    "body": "WASHINGTON—A federal prosecutor opened the first criminal trial connected to the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol by describing Guy Reffitt of Texas as someone who helped lead the pro-Trump mob to storm the building after plotting for weeks to do so.<br />“In his own words, he ‘lit the match that started the fire,’” Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey S. Nestler told jurors describing how they would hear from Mr. Reffitt’s family and friends about how Mr. Reffitt told them in December 2020 that “what is about to happen will shock the world.”"
