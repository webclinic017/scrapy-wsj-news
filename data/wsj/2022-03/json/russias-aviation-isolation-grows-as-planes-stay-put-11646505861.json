    "body": "London—Russian flag carrier  Aeroflot  Saturday said it would halt flights abroad as the country’s aviation authority placed limits on what planes could head outside its borders, increasing Russia’s isolation from the global air transport system.<br />Aeroflot-Russian Airlines  PJSC said it is suspending almost all international flights in response to government instructions. The carrier said it would maintain flights to Minsk, the capital of neighboring Belarus that has kept close ties to Russia throughout the conflict and has been used as a staging base for Russian troops. About a quarter of the airline’s 3.5 million passengers in January were on international flights."
