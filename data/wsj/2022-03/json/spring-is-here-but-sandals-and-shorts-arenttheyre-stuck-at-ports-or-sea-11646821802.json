    "body": "It is almost spring, yet many retailers are still waiting for deliveries of shorts, sandals and other warm weather gear, a sign that the supply-chain problems of the past two years haven’t abated.<br />The boardshorts that Manhattan Beach, Calif., apparel retailer Old Bull Lee hoped to showcase on its website by mid-February are still en route from China and won’t arrive at the Port of Los Angeles until mid-March. Nearly half the spring line that New York clothing chain Untuckit planned to feature in its March catalog hasn’t arrived from Vietnam.  Under Armour Inc.  said in February that cancellations related to spring and summer orders as a result of supply-chain capacity constraints would dent revenue in the current quarter by about 10 percentage points."
