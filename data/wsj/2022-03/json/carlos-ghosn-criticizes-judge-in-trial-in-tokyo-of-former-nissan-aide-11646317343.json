    "body": "TOKYO—A Tokyo judge lashed out at fugitive car executive Carlos Ghosn, calling him a greedy and malicious criminal, and Mr. Ghosn said the statements proved why he couldn’t have gotten a fair trial in Japan.<br />Thursday’s ruling by the Tokyo District Court was probably as close as Japanese courts will get to rendering a verdict on Mr. Ghosn, the former  Nissan  Motor Co. chief executive officer who escaped to Lebanon a little more than a year after his November 2018 arrest."
