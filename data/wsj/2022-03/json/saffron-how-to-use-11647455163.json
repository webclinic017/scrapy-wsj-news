    "body": "SOME THINGS are expensive for a reason. Saffron is one of them. The scarlet threads are stigmas from the Crocus sativus. Each flower produces just three, which must be harvested by hand, preferably in the dark to protect them from the scorching sun. It takes some 500 stigmas to make a single gram of saffron. No wonder the spice sells for anywhere from $10 to a mighty $75 per gram.<br />But the price doesn’t mean saffron is only for the One Percent. Used correctly, even a half-dozen strands can impart saffron’s sweet and musky essence and enhance a meal."
