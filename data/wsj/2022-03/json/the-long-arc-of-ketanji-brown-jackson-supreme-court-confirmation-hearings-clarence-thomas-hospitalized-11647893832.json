    "body": "This week’s Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson might seem like a low-stakes affair. She’d replace a fellow liberal, retiring Justice Stephen Breyer, so her elevation wouldn’t alter the Court’s current 6-3 conservative majority. Yet the arc of a Justice Jackson’s jurisprudence could be long.<br />A jarring reminder of the stakes came Sunday when the Supreme Court issued a short notice that Justice Clarence Thomas had been hospitalized with “flu-like symptoms.” He received intravenous antibiotics and was improving, though he missed Monday’s oral arguments. We wish Justice Thomas a speedy return to health, not only as a public official with whom we often agree, but also as a husband, father and a comrade in human frailty."
