    "body": "One lesson of Russia’s assault on Ukraine is that NATO continues to be vital to European security. Would Ukraine be under siege today if it were a member of the alliance? This is something to keep in mind as discussions about Sweden and Finland pursuing membership advance.<br />Unlike Ukraine, Sweden and Finland are members of the European Union and have been qualified to join NATO for years. They have held off for fear of angering Russia—and because joining was unpopular with the public in the traditionally neutral countries."
