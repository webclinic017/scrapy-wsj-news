    "body": "The Supreme Court on Monday declined to block a House redistricting map imposed by the North Carolina judiciary, but stay tuned. Four Justices explained that there’s a serious constitutional question here—and four is the magic number to take a future case.<br />The Constitution’s Elections Clause gives state legislatures the power to decide the “manner” of holding federal elections. It doesn’t say state courts decide. After the 2020 census, North Carolina lawmakers agreed to a congressional redistricting map. But the state Supreme Court threw it out, and a lower court devised new district lines. “If a redistricting process more violative of the U.S. Constitution exists, it is hard to imagine it,” state lawmakers argued in a brief."
