    "body": "‘The Contractor,” playing in theaters and streaming on demand, leaves you feeling drained and depressed. How’s that for a marquee blurb? Not a likely candidate, but not a misleading one either.<br />This quasi-military thriller, released by Paramount and directed thrillessly by Tarik Saleh from a recycling bin of a screenplay by J.P. Davis, stars Chris Pine as James Harper, a special-forces veteran of five tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. Combat has taken a terrible toll on his body. So has his addiction to drugs that control the pain. Discharged for substance abuse and stripped of his benefits and pension, James enters the shadowy world of private military contractors in order to support his family. Soon he’s off, few questions asked, on a covert mission to neutralize a supposed bioterrorist in Germany."
