    "body": "After paring down his platform during the Covid-19 pandemic to focus on core homestay and with his business coming off its strongest year ever,  Airbnb  Chief Executive Officer Brian Chesky is using a relatively inexpensive gimmick to sell long-term stays—becoming a nomad who lives on the site’s properties.<br />Chief Executive Officer Glenn Fogel of rival  Booking Holdings  doesn’t have that luxury. The company has spent heavily to market its services and to diversify its business. To his credit, Mr. Fogel has led initiatives such as moving toward connected trips, pushing mobile, bolstering its airline mix, enhancing customer-service technology and augmenting Booking’s North American hotel presence, which should pay off in time."
