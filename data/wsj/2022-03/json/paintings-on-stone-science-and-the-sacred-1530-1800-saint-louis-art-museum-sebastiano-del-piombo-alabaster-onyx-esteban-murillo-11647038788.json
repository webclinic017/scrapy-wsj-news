    "body": "St. Louis<br />‘Paintings on Stone: Science and the Sacred 1530-1800,” on display at the Saint Louis Art Museum, starts out strong, with “The Minions of Henry III” (c. 1570), a stunning image by an unknown artist in the Fontainebleau School, possibly Lucas de Heere. A close-cropped view of three effeminate men in profile, dressed in pearls, curls and sumptuous striped garments, it depicts the French king’s male lovers, crisply portrayed in oil on slate. It’s a seductive introduction to an exhibition whose thesis may seem esoteric to a public more attuned to image than materials."
