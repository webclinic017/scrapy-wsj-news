    "body": "Almost two years of chip shortages, a result of surging demand and extreme supply-chain disruptions during the pandemic, have had an unexpected upside for the semiconductor industry, preparing it to manage the turmoil caused by Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine.<br />Production of vital raw materials for chip making is concentrated in Russia and Ukraine. The countries are a major source of both neon gas, needed to feed lasers that print minute circuitry onto silicon, and the metal palladium used in later manufacturing stages."
