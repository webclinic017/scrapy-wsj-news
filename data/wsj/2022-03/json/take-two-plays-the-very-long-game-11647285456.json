    "body": "Take-Two Interactive Software  has come a very long way from relying on “Grand Theft Auto.” So it’s a bit ironic that the company’s most ambitious effort yet at diversification has also managed to draw even more attention to its blockbuster franchise.<br />Take-Two announced plans to acquire mobile game publisher  Zynga  on Jan. 10 in a cash-and-stock deal with an enterprise value of $12.7 billion. The merger will create a new videogame giant generating more than $7.5 billion in annual net bookings; mobile games are expected to account for more than half of that in its fiscal year ending in March of 2023 compared with about 12% for Take-Two now."
