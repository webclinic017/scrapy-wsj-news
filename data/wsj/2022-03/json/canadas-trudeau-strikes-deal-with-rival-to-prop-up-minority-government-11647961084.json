    "body": "OTTAWA—Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau struck a formal deal with a smaller left-wing rival to ensure his minority Liberal government can rule for the next three years without fearing defeat in Parliament and a snap election.<br />Mr. Trudeau said Tuesday the pact with the New Democratic Party is designed to bring stability amid a minority parliament and turbulence on the economic and geopolitical front. He said the two parties would cooperate in implementing a progressive agenda that focuses on climate change, expanding medical and dental coverage for lower-income Canadians, and delivering more affordable homes to Canadians. Combined, the two parties hold a majority of the seats in Canada’s lower house."
