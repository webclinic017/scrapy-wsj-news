    "body": "As  Netflix  prepares to launch the next season of one of its biggest shows ever, investors shouldn’t be expecting the streaming leader to start cribbing pages from its rivals’ scripts.<br />The second season of “Bridgerton” will be released next weekend. The first season from late 2020 still ranks as the company’s most popular English-language TV series ever in terms of hours viewed in the first 28 days. But the latest release comes as Netflix faces a much tougher audience on Wall Street concerned about the company’s ability to keep growing its subscriber base at the rate to which investors have become accustomed. Despite a strong run over the past two days, Netflix shares have still lost nearly half their value from the stock’s peak in mid-November and are down 41% for the year—the worst performance in the S&P 500 Media & Entertainment Group."
