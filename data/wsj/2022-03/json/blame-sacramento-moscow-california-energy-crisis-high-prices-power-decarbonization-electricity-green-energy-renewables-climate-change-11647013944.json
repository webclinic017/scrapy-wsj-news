    "body": "California’s politicians and policy makers eagerly emulated Europe’s energy policies for years. Like Europe, California overinvested in renewables, underinvested in hydrocarbons, prematurely shuttered its baseload power plants, and relied too heavily on imported energy. Now, as Europe is ensnared in Vladimir Putin’s energy trap, Californians watch as the state’s energy prices head toward the stratosphere.<br />On Feb. 25, the day after Russia invaded Ukraine, the Energy Information Administration reported that the all-sector price of electricity in California jumped by 9.8% last year to 19.76 cents per kilowatt-hour. Residential prices increased even more, jumping 11.7% to an average of 22.85 cents per kilowatt-hour. California residential users are now paying about 66% more for electricity than homeowners in the rest of the U.S., who pay an average of 13.72 cents per kilowatt-hour."
