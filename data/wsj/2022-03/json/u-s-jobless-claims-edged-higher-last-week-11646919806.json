    "body": "New applications for unemployment benefits in the U.S. increased last week but held near historically low levels as employers cling to workers in a tight labor market.<br />Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, rose by 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 227,000 last week, the Labor Department said Thursday. The four-week average, which smooths out volatility, increased by 500 to 231,250."
