    "body": "More than a million refugees have fled Ukraine since Russia invaded, and Europe has rightly welcomed them. Tens of thousands are also fleeing another nearby country. Their situation isn’t as dire: They’re not running from bombings, and they haven’t lost everything. Embarrassed by their nationality, they hide their Russian passports.<br />Unwelcome in the West, they flee to countries with no visa requirements for Russians, such as Georgia, Serbia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. Some are paying thousands of dollars for economy-class seats on flights to Yerevan, Armenia’s capital."
