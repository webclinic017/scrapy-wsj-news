    "body": "Joe Manchin has saved the country from a lot of bad policy in the last year, but Democratic leaders are still desperate to sign him up for a big tax and spending increase before the November election. On Wednesday the West Virginia Democrat opened the door to negotiating such a deal, and the timing would be as bad as the policy.<br />President Biden used the State of the Union address to suggest new concern about inflation and the budget deficit, two of Mr. Manchin’s main issues. “My plan will not only lower costs and give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit,” Mr. Biden said Tuesday, in an attempt to rebrand his Build Back Better plan. That disingenuous line was aimed squarely at Mr. Manchin."
