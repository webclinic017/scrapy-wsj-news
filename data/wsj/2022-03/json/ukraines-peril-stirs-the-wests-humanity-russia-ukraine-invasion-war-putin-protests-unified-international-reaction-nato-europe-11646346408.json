    "body": "It wasn’t geopolitics or ideology that determined world reaction to what happened in Ukraine this week, it was normal human feeling. An army of tanks and troops violently invades a border country populated by its cousins—a country a third its size with a tenth its might—and people watched and thought: That’s not right.<br />If it works, if Vladimir Putin gets what he wants, we go back to a world red in tooth and claw, with old restraining rules melted away. That’s not right."
