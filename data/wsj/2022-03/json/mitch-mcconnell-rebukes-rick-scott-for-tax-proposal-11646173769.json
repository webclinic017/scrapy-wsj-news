    "body": "WASHINGTON—Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell rebuked a policy agenda crafted by fellow Republican Sen. Rick Scott, saying it would raise taxes on lower-income Americans, as Democrats seized on the proposal for their midterm elections message against the GOP.<br />Mr. Scott’s 11-point “Rescue America” plan was released last week and he has paid for television and online advertising. It covers a range of topics, and includes proposals to name the border wall after former Republican President Donald Trump, balance the federal budget, prohibit the government from asking people to disclose their race on any federal form and sunset all federal legislation after five years. But a line about taxes gained the most attention. “All Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount. Currently over half of Americans pay no income tax,” it reads."
