    "body": "Predicting recessions involves a lot of correlation and not a lot of causation. What many believe is the best predictor is from the Treasury market, and it’s back in focus: an inverted yield curve, or higher yields on short-dated bonds than on long-dated bonds.<br />The correlation is what convinces many that we’re close to a flashing warning sign. The yield curve has inverted before every recession, and one widely used version is close to inverting again. The gap between the two-year yield and the 10-year yield fell below 0.2 percentage point in the past week for the first time since the 2020 recession."
