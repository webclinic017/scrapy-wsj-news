    "body": "President Biden is caught between conflicting demands that he tame rising consumer prices while banning Russian oil imports to punish Moscow for invading Ukraine, a sanction that would threaten even more inflation and raise pressure on allies with more dependence on oil imports.<br />The U.S. said Sunday it is in active discussions with allies about a ban. Those talks come as political opponents have hammered the Biden administration for months over inflation levels that have reached 40-year highs, driven by surging demand, supply-chain constraints and labor shortages. But rising energy costs are also among the biggest contributors to higher consumer prices, with oil, gas and other commodity prices soaring to the highest levels in years."
