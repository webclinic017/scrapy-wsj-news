    "body": "NO MATTER HOW enticing a weekend (a day, an hour) at a spa might sound—escaping to one is not always in the credit cards. Creating a spalike sanctuary in your own home bathroom might be, however.<br />Brigette Romanek, a Los Angeles interior designer, has designed many a tranquil retreat, including L.A.’s Lifehood spa. The easiest way to usher a relaxing mood into even a mundane bathroom, she said, is to convert light switches to dimmers. “That’s something you can do today.” The elegant example at right, Forbes & Lomax’s aged-brass dimmer, upgrades a design detail often overlooked. Fixtures with frosted-glass shades as well as bulbs that cast a warm yellow—rather than cool blue—light also make for a calmer environment, she said. In the treatment rooms of the Peninsula Spa at the Peninsula Beverly Hills, by interior design firm Forchielli Glynn, filtered light glows from behind panels of translucent capiz shells. The gridded drum of the flush-mount fixture, at right, relies on the same material."
