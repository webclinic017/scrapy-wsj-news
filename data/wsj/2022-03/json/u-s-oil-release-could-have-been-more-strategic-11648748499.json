    "body": "With OPEC and its Russia-led allies sticking to their modest oil-production plan, the White House is taking matters into its own hands. This time, it’s going big.<br />On Thursday it said it will announce the release of 1 million barrels a day (roughly 1% of global demand) from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve over the next six months, or 180 million barrels in total—the largest in its history. The announcement follows a swift meeting Thursday among members of the OPEC+ cartel, which decided not to hike its collective output beyond the planned 432,000-barrel-a-day increase scheduled for May."
