    "body": "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s refusal to give Ukraine no-fly protection from the continuing, indiscriminate and inhumane Russian attacks from the air is strategically weak and morally wrong.<br />The weapons the U.S. and its allies have sent are helping the Ukrainians defend themselves from some of the Russian attacks, but the aerial bombardment of civilians continues without risk or cost to the aggressors. We cannot stand back and allow this mass murder from the air to continue."
