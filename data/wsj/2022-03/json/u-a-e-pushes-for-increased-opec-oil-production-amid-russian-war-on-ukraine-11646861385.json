    "body": "The United Arab Emirates said it would push the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to pump more oil as crude prices rocket to near record-highs during Russia’s war on Ukraine.<br />The decision marks a departure for the Persian Gulf oil producer after months of standing with its ally Saudi Arabia, which has stuck with an alliance with Moscow on energy issues that has allowed oil prices to climb to $139 a barrel in recent days, the highest in 14 years. Until now, the U.A.E. and other OPEC members had said the rise in price wasn’t due to oil shortages, so therefore didn’t require a response from the group."
