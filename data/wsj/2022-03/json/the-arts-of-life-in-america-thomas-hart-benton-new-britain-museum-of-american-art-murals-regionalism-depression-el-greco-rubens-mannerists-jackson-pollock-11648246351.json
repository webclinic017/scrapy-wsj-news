    "body": "We can learn a lot from a simple preposition. Consider Thomas Hart Benton’s 1932 series of murals (egg tempera with oil glaze on linen), which he called “The Arts of Life in America,” not “The Arts of America” or “The Arts in America.” He wanted to show how art—most prominently music and dance—defined our vigorous, heterogeneous nation as it sank into the Great Depression. He wanted to celebrate, with an enthusiasm worthy of Walt Whitman, the exuberant, tender, bawdy, even vulgar highs and lows of American existence.<br />And he did so by also rendering a homage to the Old Masters, especially to the colors of Rubens, the serpentine figures of El Greco, and the elongations of the Italian Mannerists, all of whom he had studied in 1909 during his European travels as a young man; and another homage to his near contemporary Diego Rivera (1886-1957), whose murals influenced him upon his return to the States."
