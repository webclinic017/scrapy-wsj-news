    "body": "Air-safety regulators recently stepped up scrutiny of midair-collision warnings around the U.S., prompted by an increase of close calls at a handful of busy airports, according to people familiar with the matter and industry documents.<br />Neither the Federal Aviation Administration nor airlines think there are imminent risks to passengers, and they haven’t issued emergency orders or mandated other changes to carrier operations. Rather, safety experts said they are concerned that potential collision risks could rise as traffic continues to rebound from the Covid-19 pandemic."
