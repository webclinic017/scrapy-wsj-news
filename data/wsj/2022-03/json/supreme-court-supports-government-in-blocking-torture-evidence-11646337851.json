    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court blocked Guantanamo detainee Abu Zubaydah’s request to obtain evidence from former Central Intelligence Agency contractors who allegedly tortured him at a “black site” in Poland, siding 6-3 with government arguments that permitting such testimony could jeopardize U.S. relationships with foreign intelligence services.<br />In a second decision Thursday, an 8-1 court revived a bid by Kentucky’s Republican attorney general to continue defending a state law banning a common second-trimester abortion method, after a federal appeals court found the measure unconstitutional. In a separate case from Mississippi, the court currently is weighing whether to restrict or eliminate federal abortion rights altogether, with a decision expected before July."
