    "body": "HONG KONG—By calling for growth of 5.5% this year, China’s leaders have set a relatively high bar for an economy facing a litany of challenges at home and abroad—and paved the way, economists say, for more aggressive stimulus measures in the coming months.<br />Officials in Beijing said Saturday that they would seek to expand gross domestic product by 5.5% this year. While that target is lower than any annual target since China began setting such benchmarks in 1994, economists say it is actually a much heavier lift than its 2021 target of 6% or more, given last year’s Covid-related statistical distortions and the mounting headwinds facing the world’s second-largest economy."
