    "body": "The Federal Trade Commission is asking a court to stop  Intuit Inc.  from advertising that TurboTax users can file their taxes for free, saying that in many cases people don’t qualify to file for free on TurboTax and are instead pushed to pay for services.<br />“Much of Intuit’s advertising for TurboTax conveys the message that consumers can file their taxes for free using TurboTax,” the FTC said in a complaint filed late Monday in the U.S. District Court Northern District of California San Jose division, “even going so far as to air commercials in which almost every word spoken is the word ‘free.’ ”"
