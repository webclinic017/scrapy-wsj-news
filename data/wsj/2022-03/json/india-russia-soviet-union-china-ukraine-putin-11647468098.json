    "body": "In “The Russian Challenge to India-U.S. Ties” (East Is East, March 4), Sadanand Dhume writes that “in the popular Indian imagination the Soviet Union always had India’s back.” The truth, Mr. Dhume knows, is otherwise.<br />Although the Soviet Union did come to India’s defense during the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war over Bangladesh (by evidently sending nuclear submarines into the Bay of Bengal after President Richard Nixon dispatched the U.S. Seventh Fleet to threaten India on Pakistan’s behalf), Nikita Khrushchev flatly refused India’s request to intervene during its brief and disastrous 1962 Himalayan conflict with China. The Soviets and Chinese were ideological allies at the time, and Khrushchev clearly did not want to antagonize Mao by helping India. That crucial lack of support and misplaced trust in the Soviet Union proved costly for India, which lost the war to China, suffering a blow to its self-confidence. The scars have yet to heal."
