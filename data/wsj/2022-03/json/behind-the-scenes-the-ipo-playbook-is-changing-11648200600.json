When it thaws, it could look much different.<br />So far this year, just 22 companies have gone public in traditional initial public offerings, raising a combined $2.3 billion through Tuesday, according to Dealogic. That is a huge downshift from last year, when 79 companies had raised nearly $36 billion by this point."
