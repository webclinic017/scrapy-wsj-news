    "body": "Five years before Edward Albee unleashed George and Martha to terrorize social norms with a game of Get the Guests, Patricia Highsmith’s 1957 novel “Deep Water” concocted a couple so toxic it took Hollywood 6 1/2 decades to put them on film. One producer told Highsmith her Vic and Melinda Van Allen were too psychopathic for cinema, and the only director who dared take on their miserable marriage died by suicide after reading a draft of her script. Highsmith, never a people person, griped that the dead man owed her $12,000.<br />Kudos to erotic thriller authority Adrian Lyne for escorting the Van Allens to the screen, albeit nine years after the now 81-year-old “Fatal Attraction” director first announced his intention to give “Deep Water” a go. (As an in-joke, he’s tweaked a supporting character from the book into a frustrated screenwriter who groans that in “Hollywood they develop stuff for years and years.”)"
