    "body": "In Europe blue and yellow paint are in short supply. Europeans are asking themselves in desperation, “If we run out, how will we be able to support Ukraine?”<br />My daughter told me that dark joke. As a proud Ukrainian, I have been deeply moved by the many expressions of solidarity with my country and its people. Refugees are received with warmth and hospitality. People around the world are sending donations of all kinds. Europe and the U.S. have taken tangible steps that were unthinkable not long ago to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia’s unprovoked and barbaric invasion. Political leaders have made clear that they will increase the pressure and consider further measures. I even hear that in Western capitals sympathies are developing for the idea of sending planes to Ukraine."
