    "body": "Every day as I read and marvel about the political shenanigans in Wisconsin (“Wisconsin GOP Suicide Watch,” Review & Outlook, Feb. 22), a beloved former domicile of mine, I surprise myself by being grateful that my current home state of North Carolina, against my own choice, gave its 15 electoral votes to former President Donald Trump.
