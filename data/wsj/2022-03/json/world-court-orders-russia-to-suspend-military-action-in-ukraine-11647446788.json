    "title": "World Court Orders Russia to Suspend Military Action in Ukraine",
    "sub_head": "Vote on preliminary measures is 13-2 at the International Court of Justice, with Russian and Chinese judges dissenting",
    "category_1": "World",
    "time": "2022-03-16 14:12:00",
    "body": "The International Court of Justice on Wednesday directed Russia to suspend its military operations in Ukraine, issuing a preliminary but likely unenforceable order in Kyiv’s suit contending that the Kremlin justified its invasion on the false pretext of stopping a purported genocide in Ukraine’s Russian-speaking Luhansk and Donetsk regions.<br />The world court, an arm of the United Nations based in The Hague, has no independent power to enforce its decisions, and Russia already has argued the 15-member tribunal lacked jurisdiction over the dispute."
