    "body": "The U.S. Sentencing Commission, a panel that advises the federal judiciary on criminal-sentencing issues, played an important role in the career of Supreme Court nominee  Ketanji Brown Jackson. It has fallen on hard times since.<br />The seven-member body has dwindled to one Senate-confirmed commissioner, preventing it from conducting official business for more than three years and rendering it unable to provide formal guidance to judges after Congress passed a significant criminal-justice overhaul in 2018. The commission’s dormancy also has caught the attention of Supreme Court justices who have raised concerns about the body’s inability to fulfill its responsibilities."
