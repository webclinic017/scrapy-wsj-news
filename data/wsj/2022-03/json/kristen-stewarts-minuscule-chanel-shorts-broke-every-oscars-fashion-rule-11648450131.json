    "body": "In an era of rampant crop tops and microminis, showing skin isn’t necessarily that shocking anymore. Zendaya has made ab-flashing red-carpet looks a signature over the past few years, so when she wore a Valentino ensemble with a cropped blouse and long skirt to tonight’s Oscars it looked almost understated.<br />But when best actress nominee Kristen Stewart appeared at the event in a Chanel suit featuring short shorts, it turned up the thermometer of the Dolby Theater by several degrees. Indeed, this appeared to be the first pair of hot pants in the history of the Oscars red carpet."
