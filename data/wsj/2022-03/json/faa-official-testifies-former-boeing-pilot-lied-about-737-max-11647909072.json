    "body": "FORT WORTH, Texas—A Federal Aviation Administration training specialist said a former  Boeing Co.  pilot lied to her about how a 737 MAX flight-control system worked before two of the jets crashed three years ago.<br />The former Boeing pilot, Mark Forkner, is on trial in Fort Worth, Texas, this week over four counts of wire fraud. Federal prosecutors say Mr. Forkner, who was the aircraft’s chief technical pilot during the aircraft’s development, deceived his FAA counterpart about the automated cockpit feature later blamed for sending the two jets into fatal nosedives."
