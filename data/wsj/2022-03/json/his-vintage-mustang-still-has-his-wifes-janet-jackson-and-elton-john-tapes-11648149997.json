    "body": "Greg Ackerson, 55, owner of Blue Ridge Lumber who lives in Blairstown, N.J., on his 1966 Ford Mustang, as told to A.J. Baime.<br />My father, Donald Ackerson, was a  Ford  enthusiast, and he used to say that if Ford ever stopped making cars, he would walk. At that time, he owned one lumber store in our hometown, and we were OK financially. He told us kids that when we got our driver’s licenses, he and my mother, Grace, would buy us each a used car—as long as it was a Ford."
