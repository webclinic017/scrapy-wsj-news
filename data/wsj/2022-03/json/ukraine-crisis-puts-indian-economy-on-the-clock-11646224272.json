    "body": "Once upon a time, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised to plumb the depths of the ocean and scale the heights of space with Vladimir Putin. Today, Russia’s decision to invade Ukraine couldn't have come at a worse time for its old Cold War ally.<br />Because India is facing primarily supply push inflation, rather than both supply and demand driven price growth as in the West, the Reserve Bank of India may actually have more space than it seems to play wait-and-see with its policy stance—even given India’s huge dependence on imported oil. But if the crisis persists, then a significant rise in Indian rates may be unavoidable, and a further steep selloff in Indian assets could follow. India’s S&P BSE Sensex has fallen sharply but not disastrously in recent days: about 3% over the past week."
