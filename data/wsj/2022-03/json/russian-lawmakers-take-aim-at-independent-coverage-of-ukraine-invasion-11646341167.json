    "body": "MOSCOW—Russian lawmakers are expected to consider legislation Friday that could gag independent media coverage of the conflict in Ukraine and slap stiff penalties on foreigners, further increasing tensions between Moscow and the West.<br />One bill, which essentially amends the criminal code, would punish anyone who publishes what is deemed to be false information about Russia’s military operation in Ukraine with a 5 million ruble fine, around $44,740, and up to 15 years in prison. Other amendments would impose tough sanctions against any foreign citizens considered to have violated the rights of Russians or committed crimes against them. The current law applies only to U.S. citizens."
