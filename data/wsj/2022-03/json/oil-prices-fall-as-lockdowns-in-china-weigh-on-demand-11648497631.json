    "body": "New Covid-19 restrictions in China dragged oil prices further below recent highs on Monday, with the prospect of reduced fuel demand easing some pressure on global crude markets.<br />U.S. oil prices slid 7% to $105.96 a barrel, continuing their fall from a recent closing high of $123.70 reached earlier this month. Oil prices remain sharply higher since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, as Western sanctions and boycotts against Russia have effectively cut world-wide supply. Brent crude, the global price benchmark, dropped about 6.8% to $112.48."
