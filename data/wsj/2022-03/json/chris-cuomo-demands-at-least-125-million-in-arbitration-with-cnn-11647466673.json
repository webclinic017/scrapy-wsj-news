    "body": "Former CNN anchor Chris Cuomo is seeking at least $125 million from his old employer, claiming the network wrongfully terminated him and smeared his journalistic integrity in the process.<br />Mr. Cuomo—who was fired by CNN in December after an investigation into his efforts to help his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, respond to allegations of sexual harassment—is owed at least $15 million in salary and bonuses because of the network’s decision to fire him without cause, in violation of his contract, according to an arbitration demand filed Wednesday with dispute-resolution provider JAMS."
