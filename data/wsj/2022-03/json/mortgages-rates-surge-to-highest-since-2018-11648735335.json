    "body": "The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate home loan jumped to 4.67%, mortgage-finance giant  Freddie Mac  said Thursday, marking the weekly figure’s highest reading since December 2018.<br />The increase extends the 2022 surge in mortgage rates. The rise is hardly shocking, given the record low rates reached in the pandemic period and concerns about high U.S. inflation readings. But it has been faster than many analysts expected. At the beginning of the year, the average rate on America’s most popular home loan was 3.22%."
