    "body": "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will be felt by households around the world through higher energy and food prices, with disruptions to trade and fragile confidence contributing to a significant weakening of global economic growth, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Thursday.<br />The Paris-based research body calculates that global economic growth will be 1.1 percentage points lower, and inflation just short of 2½ points higher than if the invasion had not taken place. In late 2021, the OECD forecast the global economy would grow by 4.5% this year, and consumer prices would rise by 4.2%."
