    "body": "Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller said Friday that overseas events and the risks they pose drove him to favor a smaller rate rise by the central bank earlier this week than would have been suggested by U.S. economic data alone.<br />“The data is basically screaming at us to go 50 [basis points] but the geopolitical events were telling you to go forward with caution,” Mr. Waller said in a CNBC interview. “So those two factors combined pushed me off of advocating for a 50-basis point hike at this meeting and supporting the 25 [basis point] point hike.”"
