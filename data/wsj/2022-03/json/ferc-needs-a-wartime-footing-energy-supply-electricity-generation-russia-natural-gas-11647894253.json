    "body": "It was 5:30 a.m. when the phone rang in my Michigan hotel room. “What are you doing?” barked a voice I didn’t immediately recognize. I told him I was sleeping and he said: “Get out of bed and turn on the television!” I realized it was my boss, Martin Allday, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, where I was general counsel. It was Aug. 2, 1990, and Iraq had just invaded Kuwait. “The president has already called me,” Allday said. “We need to figure out what FERC can do if there is an energy crisis. Get back here as soon as you can.” I did.<br />George H.W. Bush had told Allday that he needed FERC staff to start putting together whatever orders the commission might issue to address potential disruptions to the energy supply. We had 48 hours, and we made the deadline. The president had the list, including relaxation of rules that restricted the output of traditional and alternative electric generators and granting special permission for natural gas to be produced and transported flexibly and freely nationwide. We got to work drafting the actual orders."
