    "body": "American frackers are raising the number of drilling rigs in oil fields by more than 20%, but donâ€™t expect a similarly sized increase in production.<br />Though the number of active U.S. oil-directed rigs has grown by roughly one-fifth in the past six months, much of the new activity is to make up for a depleted inventory of wells drilled before the pandemic, executives said. Frackers brought the best of those online last year instead of drilling new ones and will have to drill more than usual this year to offset those lost wells."
