Metropolitan Police officer Jeffrey Smith days after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol has been ruled a line-of-duty death.<br />The decision by a District of Columbia retirement board came after a monthslong fight by Mr. Smith’s widow, Erin Smith, who pushed officials to recognize her husband’s death as in the line of duty."
