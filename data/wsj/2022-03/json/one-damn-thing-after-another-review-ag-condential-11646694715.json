    "body": "In November 2020 President Trump accused the Department of Justice of failing to investigate the presidential election he claimed was stolen. Attorney General William Barr didn’t take Mr. Trump’s complaint lightly. He fired back. Justice had been looking into allegations of serious fraud, he insisted, but “to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.”<br />The president summoned him to the Oval Office. Mr. Barr knew there would be trouble. The president handed him an article quoting the statement. “Did you say this?” he asked. “Why would you say that?” Mr. Barr’s answer was simple. “Because it is true,” he answered. “But you did not have to say that! You could have just said, ‘No comment.’ This is killing me—killing me. This is pulling the rug out from under me.”"
