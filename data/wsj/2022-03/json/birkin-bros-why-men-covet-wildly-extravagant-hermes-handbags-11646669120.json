    "body": "When it comes to men brandishing  Hermès  handbags, Floyd Mayweather was ahead of the curve. For years, the prodigious pugilist known as “Money” has made a habit of parading his arsenal of lustrous handbags from the French luxury house, recognizable for their trapezoidal shape and shimmering silver buckle. “No luggage is required… just my Diamond Hermès HAC 50 Crocodile Money Bag,” reads the caption on a 2015 Instagram photo, which shows him stepping off a private jet with an imposing black leather bag in hand.<br />Kanye West, Travis Scott and Marc Jacobs have also carted boxy Birkins (first introduced in 1984 and named for the French actress Jane Birkin) or its weightier brother, the Haut à Courroies, or HAC. Hermès does not publicize the price of its coveted handbags (and they are not specifically marketed along gender lines), but, according to collectors, Birkins start around $10,000, while the larger HAC can be even more expensive."
