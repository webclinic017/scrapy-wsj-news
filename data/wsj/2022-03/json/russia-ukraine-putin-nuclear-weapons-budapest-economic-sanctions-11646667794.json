    "body": "I don’t know where John Ullyot and Thomas Grant were in 1994 when the Budapest Memorandum was signed (“The Lesson of Budapest? Hold On to Your Nukes,” op-ed, March 3), but I was in diplomat school. The topic of getting former Soviet republics to give up their nuclear arms was hotly discussed. Their national leaders at the time were largely kleptocrats—everything was for sale. One of my professors said to me, “What should we do? Let them keep their nuclear arms?” It was a rhetorical question, and we all knew the answer.<br />I performed diplomatic functions in Ukraine about five years later. I was shocked at the level of corruption and greed among Ukrainian politicians at the time. Ukraine’s nukes were going to end up in the hands of the highest bidder, which very easily could have been al Qaeda, Iran or other bad actors. Luckily, the U.S. outbid them—but not with security guarantees. The security guarantees in the Budapest Memorandum were nothing more than window dressing. Everyone knew that what Ukrainian politicians were really receiving was a blind eye turned toward their profiteering."
