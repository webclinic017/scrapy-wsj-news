    "body": "States and lower court judges are using the Voting Rights Act (VRA) as cover for race-based gerrymanders. On Wednesday the Supreme Court called foul by blocking Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers’s state legislative map.<br />The Court’s unsigned order in Wisconsin Legislature v. Wisconsin Elections Commission skewers the Governor and the Wisconsin Supreme Court. “Under the Equal Protection Clause, districting maps that sort voters on the basis of race ‘are by their very nature odious,’” the majority writes. Mr. Evers embraced “just the sort of uncritical majority-minority district maximization that we have expressly rejected.”"
