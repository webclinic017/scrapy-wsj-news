    "body": "Russia last week surprised many observers by fulfilling its obligation to pay interest on dollar-denominated sovereign bonds. The coupon payments, amounting to $117 million, were required to service two Russian government bond offerings—one maturing in 2023 and another in 2043. Creditors noted that, against expectations, the payments were received in dollars—which means Russia remains in compliance with the terms of the offerings.<br />While the U.S. has barred most transactions by American institutions with Russia’s central bank and Finance Ministry, a temporary exemption from the Treasury Department permits Russia to make these debt payments through May 25."
