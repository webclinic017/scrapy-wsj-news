    "body": "Meme stocks were one of the biggest market phenomena during the pandemic. And federal stimulus payments appear to have done a lot to fuel the surge.<br />That is the conclusion of a new study that began circulating this past week in academic circles. The research found that shares of meme stocks—speculative investments often driven by chatter on internet forums—soared in the weeks after individual investors received their first two rounds of federal stimulus checks. These meme investments, the study found, delivered gains that beat out non-meme stocks by as much as 19 percentage points."
