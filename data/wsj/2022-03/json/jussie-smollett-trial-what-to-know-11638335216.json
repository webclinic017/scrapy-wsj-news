    "body": "Actor Jussie Smollett is now awaiting sentencing in a Chicago courtroom for faking a hate crime in 2019 after telling police and the media that two men had hit him, hung a noose around his neck and yelled a pro-Donald Trump slogan along with racist and antigay slurs.<br />As of midafternoon Thursday, defense lawyers were arguing that the case and Mr. Smollettâ€™s conviction should be thrown out on a variety of grounds. They also cited errors during the trial that, at the very least, should afford them a new trial."
