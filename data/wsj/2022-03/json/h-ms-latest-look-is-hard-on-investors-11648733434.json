    "body": "H&M ’s  scanty profit shows the high price of investing for growth. Now, a costlier supply chain, weaker consumer demand and war in Ukraine all threaten returns on that cash.<br />Shares in the Swedish fast-fashion chain fell 10% in European morning trading after it reported a pretax profit for the three months through February that was less than half what analysts expected. After several years of spending heavily on e-commerce technology to catch up with Zara’s Spanish owner  Inditex ,  H&M still needs to invest more in its supply chain and sustainability initiatives."
