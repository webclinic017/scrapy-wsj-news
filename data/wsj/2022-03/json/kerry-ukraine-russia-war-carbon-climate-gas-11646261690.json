    "body": "I will give John Kerry the benefit of the doubt and assume that he thinks the human suffering in Ukraine is far worse than the greenhouse-gas emissions associated with the war (“John Kerry’s Ukraine Emissions,” Review & Outlook, Feb. 25). What I find jaw-dropping about Mr. Kerry’s interview, however, is that it seems he truly believes that Vladimir Putin or, for that matter, Xi Jinping, intends to actually do something about climate change. How can this be? Other than engaging in talks and making promises of change in the distant future, what have either of these two despots done to convince Mr. Kerry that they are intent on real change? Messrs. Putin and Xi will continue to talk a good game and happily leave climate change and the associated costs to the West.<br />Robert Maxwell"
