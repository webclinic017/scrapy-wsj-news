    "body": "SEOUL—For nearly five years under left-leaning President Moon Jae-in, South Korea went all in on engaging North Korea. That left Seoul at times out of sync with Washington and Tokyo, which back stronger confrontation with Pyongyang.<br />South Korea’s election on Wednesday to pick Mr. Moon’s successor will determine whether much of his foreign policy approach stays or goes. Progressive Lee Jae-myung, a fellow Democratic Party member with Mr. Moon, is running a tight race with the conservative Yoon Suk-yeol, who pledges to get tougher on North Korea and closer with the U.S."
