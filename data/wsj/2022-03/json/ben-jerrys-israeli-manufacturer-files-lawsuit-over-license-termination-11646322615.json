    "body": "An Israeli ice cream manufacturer has filed a breach of contract lawsuit against Ben & Jerry’s, claiming his license wasn’t renewed because of where he sells his products.<br />Avi Zinger filed a suit in New Jersey federal court Thursday, listing the Vermont ice cream brand and its parent,  Unilever PLC ,  as defendants. The lawsuit alleges the company declined to renew the license for Mr. Zinger’s American Quality Products LTD because he refused to stop distributing Ben & Jerry’s products in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and parts of contested East Jerusalem."
