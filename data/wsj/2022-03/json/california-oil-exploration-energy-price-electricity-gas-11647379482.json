    "body": "Regarding Robert Bryce’s “Blame Sacramento, Not Moscow, for California’s Energy Crisis” (Cross Country, March 12): Onshore California has some of the richest oil basins in the world, yet the state’s pump prices are the highest in the nation and increasing. Sacramento’s anti-fossil fuel and energy-ignorant efforts have resulted in exorbitant prices for mostly imported oil and gas from environmentally and politically dicey overseas locations with the highest possible greenhouse-gas emissions.<br />Oil exploration has ceased even in the oil-friendly San Joaquin Valley, while Sacramento dithers on approving hundreds of drilling permits.
