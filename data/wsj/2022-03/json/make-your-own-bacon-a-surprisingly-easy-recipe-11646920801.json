    "body": "AS A YOUNG KID in Washington, D.C., Wendell Allsbrook knew he wanted to build a business of his own. “I grew up on U Street during the crack epidemic,” he said. “I didn’t finish high school, didn’t go to college. But I was determined.” He ended up finding success in pork bellies—literally. He sells them today at his shop, Georgetown Butcher, along with Wagyu beef, organic whole chickens and a range of premium cuts and fish.<br />Mr. Allsbrook was a fishmonger at the specialty market Balducci’s in McLean, Va., and moved on to learn butchery at the Organic Butcher when it opened in McLean in 2005. “That’s when I knew I found my niche,” he said. Over 15 years there, he cultivated a following and a reputation that propelled him to open his own shop in March 2020—just as the pandemic set in. Mr. Allsbrook persevered, and thanks to shifts in his business plan and a loyal clientele, Georgetown Butcher celebrated its second anniversary this month. Mr. Allsbrook signed a lease on a second location, in the National Landing section of Northern Virginia, to open in 2024."
