    "body": "Wage growth for American women is increasing at a faster rate than for men, a stark shift from earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic.<br />Female wages were up 4.4% in February from a year earlier, compared with a 4.1% rise in male wages, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve’s wage tracker. That marks the sixth straight month that women’s wage growth outpaced men’s. Female wage gains exceeded male gains by 0.5 percentage point in December, matching the widest margin for records tracing back to 1997."
