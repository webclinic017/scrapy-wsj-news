    "body": "How will the war in Ukraine end? Much depends on whether Vladimir Putin remains—on some level—a rational actor capable of coolly weighing costs and benefits. If he is so consumed by anger and revanchism that he can no longer do so, all bets are off. But if he can, this is what he would see:<br />In the major cities along Ukraine’s northern border from Kyiv to Kharkiv, Russia’s effort to achieve a swift victory and decapitate Ukraine’s government has stalled, and Russian forces will have a hard time regaining momentum. Even if they breach the defensive perimeter around these cities, block-to-block fighting would lead to huge Russian casualties and might fail. Mr. Putin now must decide whether it is in his interest to pursue the aerial destruction of these cities—the Grozny strategy—in full view of the world."
