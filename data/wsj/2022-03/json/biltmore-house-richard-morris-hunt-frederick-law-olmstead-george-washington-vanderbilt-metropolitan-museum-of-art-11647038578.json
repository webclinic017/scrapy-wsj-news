    "body": "<br />The four-decade architectural career of Richard Morris Hunt (1827-1895) concluded with two masterworks that brought the polarities within his oeuvre to their highest pitch of refinement: on the one hand, the supremely formal and monumental classicism of the Metropolitan Museum’s majestic entrance pavilion, and on the other the stunningly picturesque, but also strikingly monumental, Biltmore House, to this day the largest private residence ever erected in the U.S."
