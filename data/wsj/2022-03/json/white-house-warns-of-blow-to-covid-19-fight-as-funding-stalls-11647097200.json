    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The Biden administration is warning that it might have to scrap critical Covid-19 programs, a potential blow to its efforts to combat the pandemic, unless Congress moves quickly to approve funding left out of the $1.5 trillion omnibus spending package.<br />The administration initially floated a $30 billion request, which it then formally cut to $22.5 billion, only to be reduced further to $15.6 billion by congressional negotiators. With Republicans insisting that no new money be allocated until previous funding rounds were exhausted, rank-and-file Democrats then balked at a proposal to reuse unspent funds intended for state governments, prompting party leaders to pull the provision altogether."
