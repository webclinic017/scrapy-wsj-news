    "body": "The Argentine journalist Javier Sinay’s family memoir, “The Murders of Moisés Ville: The Rise and Fall of the Jerusalem of South America,” is as fascinating as it is quirky—a journey that begins in the impoverished Jewish communities of late 19th- and early 20th-century Eastern Europe and winds its way through the newly built towns on the pampas of Argentina, where, for a time, Yiddish was the common tongue.<br />Imagining the lilting sound of Yiddish echoing through the Argentine plains and countryside can seem like a dream. But Mr. Sinay reminds us that this was a real chapter in Jewish history. The Yiddish-speaking members of the diaspora who fled the pogroms and persecution of the Old World for South America differed little from those who landed in North America."
