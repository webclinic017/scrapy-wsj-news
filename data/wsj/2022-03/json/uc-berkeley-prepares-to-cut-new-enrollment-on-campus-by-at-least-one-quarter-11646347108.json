    "body": "The University of California, Berkeley is preparing to cut its on-campus enrollment by at least 2,500 students this fall, after the state’s highest court overruled its request to reverse an enrollment cap instituted by a trial judge.<br />The court decision throws into disarray the school’s plans for about one-quarter of the new undergraduate students it expected to bring to campus, including both first-year students and transfers. At least 1,500 of those students will be offered one of two options: to enroll online for the fall, or to defer their enrollment entirely until January 2023."
