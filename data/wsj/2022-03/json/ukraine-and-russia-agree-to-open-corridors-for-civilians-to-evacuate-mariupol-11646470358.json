    "body": "KYIV, Ukraine—The agreement between Russia and Ukraine on evacuating civilians from the besieged cities of Mariupol and Volnovakha collapsed on Saturday, as Kyiv accused Moscow of violating the agreed-to cease-fire and resuming its attacks on residential areas.<br />Some 200,000 civilians were expected to start leaving Mariupol and 15,000 from Volnovakha in eastern Ukraine at 9 a.m. local time, in a deal overseen by the International Committee of the Red Cross. But, at 11:45, Russia resumed shelling Volnovakha with heavy weapons, while also continuing military operations on the route leading out of Mariupol, said Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk."
