    "body": "I am moved by Maj. Steve Dalton’s plea for real practice for fighter pilots (Letters, Feb. 28). There is no substitute for hands-on experience.<br />Years ago, when the case was made for cutting medical and surgical resident’s hours so that there would be no tired doctors, many of us felt precisely as Mr. Dalton feels. The terrible Libby Zion tragedy in 1984, which ultimately resulted in shortened physician-training hours, has today given us young doctors poorly prepared for their enormous responsibilities. As with shortened practice for bombing runs and lack of gun ammunition, the training change had predictable results with human lives at stake."
