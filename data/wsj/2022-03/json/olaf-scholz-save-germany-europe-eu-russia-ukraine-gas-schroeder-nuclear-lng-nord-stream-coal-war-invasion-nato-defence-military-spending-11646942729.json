    "body": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stunned the world and his own country on Feb. 27 when he announced a revolution in the way Berlin will conduct foreign and defense policy in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A paradox has manifested itself in the days since: Observers are so focused on the magnitude of these massive changes that they haven’t much discussed the gargantuan ones that will by necessity accompany them.<br />The outline of the chancellor’s plan is well known by now, and pray it all comes true. Berlin is creating a €100 billion ($113 billion) special defense budget to fund equipment purchases and upgrades, in tandem with a pledge to exceed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s target of 2% of gross domestic product spent on defense each year. Germany will treat energy as a national-security matter and wean itself off Russian natural gas. Statements from government figures make clear this means reconsidering Germany’s phase-out of coal and (maybe) nuclear power."
