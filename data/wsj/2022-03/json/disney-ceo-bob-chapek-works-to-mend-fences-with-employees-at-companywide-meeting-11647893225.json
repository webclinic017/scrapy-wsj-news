    "body": "Walt  Disney Co.  Chief Executive Bob Chapek told employees Monday that the company made a mistake by not taking a public stance against Florida’s recently passed Parental Rights in Education bill, a decision which infuriated many at the entertainment giant and has undercut faith in his leadership.<br />In a hastily scheduled virtual town hall meeting with Disney leadership and employees, Mr. Chapek said he understood the pain the company’s initial silence on the bill—dubbed by opponents as “Don’t Say Gay”—has caused, according to people who attended the event."
