    "body": "Democrats have lost ground to Republicans on education this year. A 9-point advantage has been cut to 5 points, according to a Wall Street Journal survey released last weekend. Republicans, meanwhile, continue to increase their support among minority voters. Maybe there’s a connection.<br />Typical is New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat in his second term who gives lip service to school choice but in practice does the bidding of charter-school opponents. Mr. Murphy is said to have presidential ambitions, and he doesn’t want to anger the powerful teachers unions that spent more than any other interest group to back his gubernatorial campaigns."
