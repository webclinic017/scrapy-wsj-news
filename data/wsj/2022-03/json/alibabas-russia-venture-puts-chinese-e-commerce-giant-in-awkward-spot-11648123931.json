    "body": "On a business trip to Russia in 2016,  Alibaba  founder Jack Ma was having lunch and listening to his executives extol the success the company was enjoying in the country.<br />Skeptical, he pulled aside a waitress and asked what she knew about AliExpress, the Chinese e-commerce giant’s international shopping site, according to a person who was there. She said she used it almost every week. Pleasantly surprised, Mr. Ma signed off on plowing more resources into Russia, including dozens of employees from Alibaba’s headquarters in Hangzhou and, later, investing $100 million to form a joint venture with three Russian corporate titans."
