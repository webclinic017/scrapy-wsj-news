    "body": "As Russia’s war on Ukraine enters its sixth week, the script has flipped. Russia’s advance has stalled, and Ukraine now wants to go on offense to push back Russian forces from the land they’ve taken. But the country needs U.S. and NATO help to do it, and it seems the Biden Administration is reluctant to provide those weapons and intelligence.<br />In her Wednesday press briefing, White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said no fewer than eight times that Vladimir Putin had committed a “strategic blunder” or “mistake” or “error” by invading. That’s the White House line to suggest that the West is winning against the Russians."
