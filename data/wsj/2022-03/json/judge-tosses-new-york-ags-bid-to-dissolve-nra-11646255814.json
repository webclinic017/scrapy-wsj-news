    "body": "A state court judge dismissed the New York Attorney General’s attempt to dissolve the National Rifle Association, ruling that the state’s allegations of corruption and mismanagement by NRA top officials fell short of the public harm required to impose the “corporate death penalty” on the nonprofit group.<br />The ruling Wednesday by New York Supreme Court Judge Joel M. Cohen represented a big win for the NRA, even as it allowed the bulk of the New York attorney general’s case to go forward against the group and four of its top current and former officials."
