    "body": "To the disappointment of many international observers, Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson last week dismissed the idea that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would drive Sweden into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Applying for membership would “further destabilize the situation,” she said curtly during a press conference Wednesday. But domestic politics may yet take the country closer to NATO, either by forcing Ms. Andersson’s hand or shifting power to her opponents.<br />The prime minister’s comments look craven next to the bold stances other European powers have taken against Vladimir Putin. Before his invasion of Ukraine, Europe seemed largely divided on the question of Russia. But since Mr. Putin’s troops marched across the Ukraine border, European leaders have shown a largely unified front against him."
