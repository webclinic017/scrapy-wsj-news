    "body": "In “A Legal Settlement Shows the Risks of Doing Business in China” (op-ed, March 14), Jillian Kay Melchior is right to stress the importance of the rule of law. But these risks extend beyond the absence of a reliable legal system. As we’ve seen with the Ukraine invasion, U.S. companies are taking huge losses after withdrawing from their operations in Russia. So what does the future hold for American business should China invade Taiwan? In 2020 the U.S. did about $615 billion in business with China.<br />To explore that question, I have filed shareholder proposals this year at 3M and Verizon. What would happen to shareholder value if 3M lost its China operations? What would happen at Verizon if the Chinese supply of smartphones suddenly dried up?"
