    "body": "HONG KONG—China’s strong export momentum ebbed slightly in the first two months of this year as the pandemic-driven global boom in demand for the country’s goods fades, adding pressure on policy makers to prop up growth through further stimulus.<br />Exports in January and February rose 16.3% in dollar terms from a year earlier to $544.7 billion, according to data from the General Administration of Customs. While that beat expectations of a 15% gain among economists polled by The Wall Street Journal, it still marked a slowdown from the 20.9% year-over-year increase in December."
