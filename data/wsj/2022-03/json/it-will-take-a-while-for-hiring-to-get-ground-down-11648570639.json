    "body": "The Federal Reserve is aiming to cool down the economy, and that means it is aiming to cool down the job market, too. Considering how intense businesses’ hiring needs are right now, though, it could take a while for the central bank’s efforts to register much of an obvious effect.<br />The Labor Department on Tuesday reported that there were a seasonally adjusted 11.3 million job openings on the last day of February, about even with January’s figure and close to December’s record 11.4 million. There were 1.8 jobs for each unemployed person, matching a record set in December. The ratio of job openings to total hires during the month—a measure of how hard it is for employees to find workers—slipped from 1.8 in January to 1.7, still extremely high."
