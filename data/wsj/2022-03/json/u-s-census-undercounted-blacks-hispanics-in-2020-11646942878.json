    "body": "The 2020 census on net missed about 0.24% of the U.S. population, or about three-quarters of a million people, the Census Bureau said Thursday in releasing a key report card on the accuracy of the count.<br />The margin wasnâ€™t statistically significant but many groups were miscounted at significant rates, according to bureau officials. About 3.3% of Black people were missed, as were 5% of Hispanic people and 0.9% of American Indians and Alaska Natives."
