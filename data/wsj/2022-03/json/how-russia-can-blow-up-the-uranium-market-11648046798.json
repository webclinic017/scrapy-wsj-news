    "body": "Nuclear and weaponizing are scary words to utter together, even in the context of energy.<br />That fear is behind a rally in a key fuel not yet hit by a physical shortage. Prices of uranium oxide have soared to $57.50 per pound, levels last seen more than a decade ago before the Fukushima disaster turned global sentiment against nuclear energy. They are up more than a third since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Shares of Canadian uranium miner  Cameco  have rallied 29% year to date, while  Sprott Physical Uranium Trust ,  a fund that owns physical uranium, is up 31%."
