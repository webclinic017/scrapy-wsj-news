    "body": "Wiretapping has a longer history than current battles over privacy and surveillance would appear to suggest. Today the national debate is focused on the unique challenges to privacy that the digital age presents, making it easy for government agencies and corporate conglomerates to monitor the things we say and the data we produce. But Americans were already worried about the dangers of wiretapping in the 19th century, when petty crooks and con artists began to take advantage of the nation’s new dependence on telegraph communications.<br />The original wiretappers were military men who perfected the tricks of their trade during the Civil War, the first armed conflict in which the use of electronic communications proved decisive. To intercept the enemy’s messages was a relatively simple affair—a mere matter of cutting into a telegraph wire and attaching a fine copper extension line to the exposed cable. Confederate wiretapper George “Lightning” Ellsworth was reputed to be able to place both ends of a severed telegraph line against his tongue and “read” the incoming electrical signals as they pulsed through his mouth."
