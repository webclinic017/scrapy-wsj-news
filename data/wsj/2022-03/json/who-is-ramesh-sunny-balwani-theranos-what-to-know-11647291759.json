    "body": "Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani is facing a criminal trial in federal court in San Jose, Calif., on charges that he defrauded investors and patients by lying about the capabilities of Theranos Inc.’s finger-prick blood-testing technology. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. A dozen jurors were selected in early March, ahead of opening arguments this week in a trial estimated to last 13 weeks.<br />Mr. Balwani, age 56, was the chief operating officer and president at Theranos, a blood-testing startup that claimed it could test for more than 200 health conditions using only a few drops of blood extracted from a finger prick. Mr. Balwani served in that role from 2009 to 2016, and oversaw the company’s lab. He was the closest confidant to Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes."
