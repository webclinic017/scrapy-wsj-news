    "body": "In “Give Unto Others,” Donna Leon’s latest procedural starring Commissario Guido Brunetti, the city of Venice is breathing a bit easier after getting past the peak of the pandemia. Venetians are once again taking pleasant walks along the canals. The city is preparing for the return of tourists. And Brunetti barely thinks twice about accepting a plea from a childhood neighbor to (unofficially) investigate a family problem.<br />Elisabetta Foscarini is the daughter of a woman who had been kind to Brunetti’s mother. She’s concerned, she says, by the recent behavior of Enrico Fenzo, an accountant married to her daughter, Flora, a veterinarian. Enrico, whose clients include Elisabetta’s husband, told Flora that they both might be in trouble if certain facts about his business were to become public. Elisabetta hints that her own spouse may be causing Enrico such distress."
