    "body": "The tax reform movement has arrived on the Gulf Coast, with Mississippi becoming the latest state to propose rate cuts. The plan will help the state economy—all the more if legislators keep their pledge to follow up with additional cuts.<br />State legislative leaders agreed Saturday to an income-tax cut that will give Mississippi the nation’s fifth-lowest top rate (for states with an income tax). The plan would reduce the highest rate to 4% in stages from 5% by 2026, and eliminate a current 4% rate that applies to taxable income between $5,000 and $10,000. The state House and Senate passed the tax bill on Sunday, and it now awaits Gov. Tate Reeves’s signature."
