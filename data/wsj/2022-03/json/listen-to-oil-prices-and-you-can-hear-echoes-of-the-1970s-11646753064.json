    "body": "When oil prices double or more in a year, bad things often happen. Sometimes that is a recession, as in 1974, 1980 or 2001. Other times, a recession has just started, as in 1990 or 2008. On Monday, the global crude oil benchmark briefly spiked to $139 a barrel, doubling from a year ago, as an embargo on Russian oil exports was discussed. Are these gloomy historical parallels justified, or could this be more like 2017, when oil doubled and everything was hunky-dory?<br />The two best comparisons for what is going on are 1974 and 1979-81, but they bring different explanations for what might happen next."
