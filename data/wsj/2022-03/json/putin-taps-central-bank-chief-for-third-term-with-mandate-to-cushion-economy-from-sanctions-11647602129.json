    "body": "President Vladimir Putin nominated Bank of Russia Gov. Elvira Nabiullina, a longtime ally, for a third term as head of the bank, signaling that he wants continuity in economic leadership as the country absorbs the pain from its war with Ukraine and Western sanctions.<br />Russia faces a deep recession, major job losses and spiraling inflation. A weakened ruble is pushing prices of imports even higher, while sanctions will likely lead to shortages of many goods as job losses mount."
