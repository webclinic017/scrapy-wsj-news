    "body": "There are millions of jobs available in the U.S. Most of them will probably never be filled.<br />The Labor Department on Wednesday reported that U.S. employers had a seasonally adjusted 11.3 million job openings on the last day of January. Other than December’s record 11.4 million available jobs—a number that was revised from 10.9 million in Wednesday’s report—that counted as the highest level in the 21 years of data. It amounts to 1.7 open positions for each of the 6.5 million active job seekers who were counted as unemployed in January."
