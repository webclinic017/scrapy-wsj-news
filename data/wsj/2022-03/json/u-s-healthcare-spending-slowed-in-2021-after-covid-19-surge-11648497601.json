    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”U.S. healthcare spending is expected to have slowed last year after reaching a nearly two-decade high driven by the pandemic, according to a new report by federal regulators.<br />National health spending is projected to have grown 4.2% to $4.3 trillion in 2021, compared with a growth surge of 9.7% in 2020, according to the report from actuaries at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The slowdown came from a decline in the use of healthcare services and federal financial stimulus as Covid-19 cases fell amid a pandemic that has led to nearly 975,000 deaths and almost 80 million cases in the U.S."
