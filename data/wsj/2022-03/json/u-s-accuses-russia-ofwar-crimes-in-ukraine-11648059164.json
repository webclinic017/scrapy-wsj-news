    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. government accused Russian forces in Ukraine of committing war crimes, an action that will formalize continuing investigations into alleged atrocities.<br />The designation, which doesn’t accuse Russian President Vladimir Putin or any other officials personally of war crimes, would entail the preservation by the U.S. government of information and potential evidence for future accountability, officials said."
