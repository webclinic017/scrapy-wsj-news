    "body": "U.S. small firms added workers in February and continued to increase employee compensation as the labor market remains historically tight. That’s according to the latest employment report from the National Federation of Independent Business, due out later today.<br />New hiring last month was relatively modest, as the average firm participating in the survey reported an increase of 0.11 employee. But after a flat January and a December average increase of just 0.04 worker per firm, today’s report represents very welcome news."
