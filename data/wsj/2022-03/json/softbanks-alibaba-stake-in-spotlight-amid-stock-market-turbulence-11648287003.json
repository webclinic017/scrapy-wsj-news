    "body": "The turmoil in Chinese technology shares is damping the financial firepower Japan’s  SoftBank  Group Corp. has for new investments, and prompting debate about whether it might sell some of its huge stake in  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd.<br />Shares in Alibaba—SoftBank’s single biggest investment—and other Chinese tech companies have been hit hard over the past year by Beijing’s clampdown on the sector and have been highly volatile in recent weeks. Outside of Chinese shares, some other fast-growing tech companies backed by SoftBank have also fallen in value, such as  Uber Technologies Inc.  and  Coupang Inc."
