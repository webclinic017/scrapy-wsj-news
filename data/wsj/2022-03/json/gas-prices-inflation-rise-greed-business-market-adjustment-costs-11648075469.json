    "body": "Your editorial “Biden’s Vast Oil Conspiracy” (March 17) notes the Federal Reserve’s finding that “when oil prices rise after being steady for some time—gasoline prices shoot up quickly,” but “when oil prices fall after being steady for some time, gasoline prices retreat slowly.” The editorial explains that asymmetry as firms’ response to the knowledge that oil-price declines may be temporary fluctuations. This explanation works only because of the more fundamental fact of adjustment costs.<br />Throughout the production chain, it is easier to cut back production than it is to increase it. It is easier to mothball an existing plant than build a new one, easier to lay off an employee than search for, hire and train a new one, and so forth. The underlying asymmetry in adjusting quantity leads to the asymmetry in adjusting price that’s found in markets for both producer and consumer goods."
