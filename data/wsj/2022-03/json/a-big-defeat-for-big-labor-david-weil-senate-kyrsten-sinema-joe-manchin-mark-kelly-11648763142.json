    "body": "The tide is turning politically on Capitol Hill, and the latest evidence is the surprising defeat of David Weil to run the Labor Department’s Wage and Hour Division. Three Democrats—Joe Manchin, Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly—opposed the union favorite on the Senate floor.<br />Mr. Weil had the same job in the Obama Administration, when he sought to destroy the franchise business model and gig economy as Americans know them. President Biden nominated him for a second stint on the expectation that he would impose via regulation much of Big Labor’s Pro Act that has failed to pass the Senate."
