    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Friday reinstated the death sentence for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing that killed three people and wounded hundreds more.<br />An appeals court set aside Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s sentence in 2020, finding that the trial judge erred in excluding mitigating evidence that suggested the defendant’s elder brother, Tamerlan, was more culpable for the attack and limiting the questions defense attorneys could ask prospective jurors about their exposure to news accounts of the crime."
