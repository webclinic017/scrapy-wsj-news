    "body": "U.S. stock futures edged down and government bonds took a breather after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the first time since 2018, and as Chinese shares extended a robust rebound.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 declined 0.3%, pointing to a decline in the broad-market index after it closed more than 2% higher on the past two consecutive days. Nasdaq-100 futures fell 0.4%, suggesting moderate losses for technology stocks after the opening bell."
