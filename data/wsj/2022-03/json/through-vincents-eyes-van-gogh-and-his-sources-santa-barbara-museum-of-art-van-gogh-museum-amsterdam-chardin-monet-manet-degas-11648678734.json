    "body": "Santa Barbara, Calif.<br />Eik Kahng, chief curator at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, wants to change your mind about Vincent van Gogh. Many people who love his brilliant paintings (and who doesn’t?) also believe they know him. Through biographies, movies and monographic museum exhibitions, they see him as a lone genius, a stormy social misfit, a suicidal depressive, a failure in his lifetime. And they surmise that his angst was the wellspring of his groundbreaking art."
