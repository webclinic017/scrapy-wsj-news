    "body": "For global shipping companies who spent the past year feasting on insatiable demand for their services, the party must end sooner or later. The Russia-Ukraine war is putting pressure on the shipping lines with delivery disruptions and rerouting of cargo. But the big story remains the normalization of U.S. demand as stimulus fades and the waning Omicron wave pushes global consumption back toward services, which appears to already be weighing on some shipping rates.<br />And if the war grinds on and starts hurting growth globally, rates may start trending downward much faster. Shipping shares like Cosco Shipping,  A.P. Moeller-Maersk ,   Evergreen Marine  and  Hapag-Lloyd AG  could face increasing headwinds by late 2022 or early 2023."
