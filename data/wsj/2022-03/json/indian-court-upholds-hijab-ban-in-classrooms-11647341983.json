    "body": "NEW DELHI—An Indian court has upheld a ban against wearing the hijab in classrooms in the southern state of Karnataka, weeks after the issue sparked confrontations outside campus gates and stoked religious tensions.<br />Delivering its verdict on Tuesday, the Karnataka High Court ruled that hijabs—Islamic headscarves—didn’t constitute a part of “essential religious practice in Islamic faith.” It dismissed petitions filed by Muslim students who had been barred from attending classes."
