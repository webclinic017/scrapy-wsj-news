    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden’s budget proposes billions of dollars to combat violent crime, setting a pre-midterm-election marker for moderate Democrats against calls from progressives to reduce funding to police forces.<br />In the budget unveiled Monday, the administration asked for more than $2.5 billion in new spending for the Justice Department for the next fiscal year, and separately proposed $30 billion over the next decade to “support law enforcement, crime prevention, community violence intervention, and justice system reform,” the Justice Department said."
