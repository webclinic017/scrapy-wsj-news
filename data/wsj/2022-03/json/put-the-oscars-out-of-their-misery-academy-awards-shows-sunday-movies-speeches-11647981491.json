    "body": "When was the last time you were invited to an Oscars party and wanted to go? I remember a good one, when “Terms of Endearment” cleaned up, winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress (Shirley MacLaine) and Best Supporting Actor (Jack Nicholson). That was 1984.<br />The 94th Academy Awards will air Sunday. Last year’s broadcast drew the smallest audience on record: 9.85 million viewers, down 58% from 23.6 million for the 2020 show, which ran before the pandemic took hold in the U.S. By comparison, almost every Super Bowl in the past decade has drawn more than 100 million TV viewers."
