    "body": "The scenes of carnage and cruelty in Ukraine are incomprehensible. It may be Vladimir Putin’s war and strategy, but the ground operations are being coordinated by Russian generals on the frontlines, and they are every bit as culpable as their commander in the Kremlin. Those generals will be prosecuted as war criminals in the future. They should be subjected to sanctions now.<br />The Biden administration has used sanctions skillfully as its primary means to punish Mr. Putin and his close associates. Those sanctions have disrupted major parts of the Russian economy. While they have yet to change Mr. Putin’s behavior, the consequences of those sanctions are felt widely. All Russia’s oligarchs can do is watch as countries seize their yachts, real estate and bank accounts. Few generals may enjoy great wealth, but travel bans against them and their families sting."
