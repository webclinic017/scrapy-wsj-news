    "body": "Regarding Ilya Shapiro's op-ed “Mob Rule at Hastings Law School” (March 23): One 45-minute disruption is neither mob rule nor a “canceling.” And campus debate hasn’t been “shut down.” It continues—but without a tweet that was plainly racist in effect, regardless of intent.<br />I certainly agree that Mr. Shapiro was exposed to physically intimidating conduct (by a very small number of students) that should not be countenanced. But for the overwhelming majority, after the intermittent chanting and speaking, everyone quietly and peacefully left the room. The possibility of consequences for a few remains. But overall the college is now engaged in constructive, if also unsettling, discussions. The message of the protesters has finally been heard."
