    "body": "Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is already a humanitarian disaster. Although Vladimir Putin’s endgame is not yet clear, the West’s expressed refusal to place boots on the ground in Ukraine invites Russia to expand its long-shrunken empire. Mr. Putin views the whole of Ukraine as ripe for reconquest, while he must see Poland, the Baltics and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization enemies as vulnerable to nonmilitary subversion.<br />Short of committing troops, what can NATO do to weaken Mr. Putin’s hand? The coalition is already supplying Ukraine with war-fighting materiel and logistical and tactical assistance, denying airspace to Russia, and offering immediate refuge for displaced families. President Biden’s skillful orchestration of severe trade, currency, banking and other economic sanctions against Moscow and Russian oligarchs have created viselike pressures that will grow steadily more effective as economic panic takes hold in Russia. Even dictators like Mr. Putin must attend to domestic opposition to war, already evidenced by public protests and outrage over the number of Russian soldiers coming home in body bags. The key question is one of timing: Can these factors take full effect before Russia subjugates Ukraine?"
