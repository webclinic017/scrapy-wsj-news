    "body": "Private-equity firm Hellman & Friedman LLC has taken a 7.5% stake in  Splunk Inc.  worth about $1.4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, a big bet on the software company and its incoming chief executive.<br />Hellman & Friedman started buying the stake in mid-late December after Splunk shares plunged when the companyâ€™s former CEO resigned following several quarters of disappointing results. The stake would make Hellman & Friedman the largest active shareholder of Splunk, which has a market value of nearly $20 billion."
