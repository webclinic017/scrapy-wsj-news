    "body": "After rushing to unload their Russia investments, some big asset managers are taking a hard look at their exposure to other emerging markets.<br />Large investors and their advisers in recent years searched developing countries for higher returns and growth, particularly with U.S. stocks at elevated prices and U.S. bonds at historic low yields. Instead, losses last year from Chinese home builders and technology companies are being exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine war. Now, after years of underperformance relative to some U.S. equivalents, some investors are questioning the role of emerging markets in their portfolios."
