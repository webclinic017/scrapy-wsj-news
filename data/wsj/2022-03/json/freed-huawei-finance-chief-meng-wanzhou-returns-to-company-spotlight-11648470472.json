    "body": "HONG KONG—Months after returning home to a hero’s welcome in China, Huawei Technologies Co. finance chief Meng Wanzhou was back in the spotlight Monday: This time, she was in more familiar surroundings, taking the stage at Huawei’s headquarters to deliver the company’s closely watched annual results.<br />Ms. Meng has kept a low profile since she was released from house arrest in Canada in September after ending a three-year legal fight against extradition to the U.S. on fraud charges, avoiding major events featuring other top Huawei executives. But with the company giving an update on finances Monday, she took the lead at a press conference, unveiling a mixed slate of figures that show the tech giant is still working to reboot in the face of long-running U.S. restrictions."
