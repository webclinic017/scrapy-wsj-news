    "body": "A coach who assisted in perhaps the greatest college basketball upset of all time is now creating another underdog story. Specifically, a man who has overcome both cancer and the decision to become an attorney is now leading his unheralded team into next week’s NCAA tournament.<br />On Sunday the athletics department at Virginia’s Longwood University announced: “Yes it’s a dream, and yes it’s real. Longwood is headed to March Madness.” The joyous release from the school followed a win in the Big South conference tournament. The Longwood Lancers had never had a winning record in conference play until Griff Aldrich arrived to coach four years ago. Mr. Aldrich has described the school’s decision to hire him as “a hare-brained notion” but he has certainly vindicated its judgment."
