    "body": "Young readers are likeliest to know Gregory Maguire for the Broadway musical based on his 1995 novel “Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West.” In that book, Mr. Maguire defangs the villainess of L. Frank Baum’s story of Dorothy and Toto in the land of Oz, revealing her as a sympathetic character. He performs the same expectation-reversal for a number of predators in an animal story for children ages 7-11, “Cress Watercress.”<br />The heroine of this anthropomorphic tale is a young rabbit, Cress, who after her father’s death must move with her mother and baby brother to low-rent digs in an unfamiliar part of the forest. It is a hard adjustment. The Broken Arms apartment tree is shabby and crowded. The landlord is a haughty, ill-humored owl who demands payment in moths. Grief is a constant drag on Cress and her mother as they struggle to adapt to a jostling milieu of quirky new neighbors: intrusive mice, noisy squirrels, a flighty hen and a conceited skunk who wears a live chinchilla around her neck. David Litchfield’s illustrations (see right) have such bright, glowing colors that even the nocturnal scenes seem bathed in light."
