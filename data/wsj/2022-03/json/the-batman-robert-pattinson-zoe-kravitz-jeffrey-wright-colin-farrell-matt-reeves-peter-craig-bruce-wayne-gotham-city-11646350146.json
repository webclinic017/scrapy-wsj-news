    "body": "Murmuring while he’s journaling, the latest incarnation of the Dark Knight, played by Robert Pattinson, sounds like a worrywart: “I must choose my targets carefully. It’s a big city. I can’t be everywhere.” Then a nutjob: “They think I’m hiding in the shadows. But I am the shadows.” Then he’s a Gloomy Gus, a tall, brooding presence barely distinguishable from those shadows: “I wish I could say I’m making a difference, but I don’t know.”<br />Is Batman going bonkers? No, but he’s going through a dark night of the soul in “The Batman,” which Matt Reeves directed from a screenplay he wrote with Peter Craig. The film, playing in theaters, is very long, relentlessly intense, murmured more often than spoken, and photographed, by Greig Fraser, with a glowering gorgeousness that must be seen to be felt. It’s also enthralling and tailored to our time, an extended rumination on finding one’s moral compass in a world of all-encompassing evil. (The production was designed by James Chinlund. Michael Giacchino did the haunting music.)"
