That’s the fate of Iranian blogger Hossein Ronaghi for writing an October op-ed in these pages.<br />We recently told you that Mr. Ronaghi went missing on Feb. 23—the day after he tweeted in opposition to legislation that would give Iranian authorities new powers to suppress online speech and censor internet content."
