    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”The House easily passed legislation Thursday to end normal trade ties with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, moving quickly to approve the measure after President Biden announced his support last week.<br />The Suspending Normal Trade Relations with Russia and Belarus Act passed 424 to 8 on a fast-track procedure that requires at least two-thirds of lawmakers support the measure. The bill now heads to the Senate. That chamber has a matching bill with bipartisan support and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said he would work to move it quickly."
