    "body": "Hypercompetitive and costly, online groceries are a tough sell—both for consumers and for investors.  Boxed ,  which went public through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, last December, is having an easier time courting investors than customers at the moment.<br />Boxed, which sells bulk quantities of pantry items and consumer packaged goods—such as snacks and paper towels—said Tuesday that its total revenue declined 5.3% in 2021 compared with a year earlier. That is disappointing compared with the 13.4% growth the company initially pitched to investors back in mid-2021, but pretty much in line with the considerably toned-down guidance the company gave in October. Numbers would have looked a lot worse had Boxed not signed on a major client—Asian retail giant  Aeon —to buy its e-commerce software. In addition to its retail business, Boxed sells its in-house e-commerce software to other retailers."
