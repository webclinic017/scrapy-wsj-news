    "body": "President Biden late last month nominated Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. If confirmed by the Senate, she would be the first Black woman on the high court, succeeding longtime liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, who said in January that he was retiring.<br />Judge Jackson was born in Washington, D.C., to two public-school teachers who moved the family to the Miami area when she was a child. Her parents, she said, named her Ketanji Onyika to express pride in their African ancestry. Her father later became an attorney with the Miami-Dade County School Board and her mother a principal at a public magnet school."
