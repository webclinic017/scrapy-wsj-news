    "body": "Regarding Tarren Bragdon’s “Florida Helps Families See Behind the College Curtain” (Cross Country, March 19): It is lamentable that college has devolved into white-collar vocational training, the value of a university education measured only by the projected income of its graduates. Higher education used to be a selective opportunity for advanced learning, an adventure into art, philosophy, science and all the great hallmarks of civilization. It must at the very least (given the failure of high schools) provide the educational foundation—literacy, numeracy, civics, critical thinking—for adulthood, a meaningful career and responsible citizenship.<br />I wish the Bragdon kids success, but if all they get out of college is a lucrative job, they will have wasted more than their parents’ money."
