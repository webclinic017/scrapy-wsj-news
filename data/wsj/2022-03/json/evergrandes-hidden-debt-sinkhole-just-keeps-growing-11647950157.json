    "body": "Evergrande ’s  latest announcement is raising more questions about how much it really owes. Investors may not like the answers: especially since Chinese property developers’ hidden debt problem isn’t confined to Evergrande alone.<br />The beleaguered Chinese developer said Tuesday that more than $2 billion of cash held by its separately listed property-service unit has been seized by banks as security for third-party pledge guarantees. The subsidiary said it discovered this during the preparation of its 2021 financial report. Both Evergrande and the unit won’t be able to meet the deadline to publish their annual results before the end of March."
