    "body": "Credit Suisse  Group AG is expected to pay around $500 million after losing a lawsuit brought by a Georgian billionaire who claimed the bank mismanaged his money.<br />Credit Suisse has spent years fending off claims from Bidzina Ivanishvili, a former prime minister of Georgia. He sued the bank in Bermuda and Singapore for breach of trust, alleging he lost $800 million on forged trades made by his Geneva-based private banker, Patrice Lescaudron. Mr. Ivanishvili sought $400 million damages in Bermuda’s Supreme Court, where a five-week trial ended in December."
