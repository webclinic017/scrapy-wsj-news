    "body": "Italian yacht maker Ferretti SpA made its debut on the Hong Kong stock exchange, after selling $244 million of stock despite a choppy global market for initial public offerings.<br />IPOs have slowed markedly this year, including in the U.S., with global proceeds falling about 75% compared with a year earlier, according to Dealogic. Rapid inflation, interest-rate rises and Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine have roiled world markets, while Hong Kong stocks have also been rattled by concerns over regulatory pressure in China and potential U.S. delistings."
