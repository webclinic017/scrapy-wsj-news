    "body": "Some Western observers hope Vladimir Putin will be overthrown in a coup. While the likelihood of such an event is debatable, one thing is certain: If Mr. Putin were removed in a coup, whoever replaces him would face the same domestic political incentives and disincentives, which would likely lead to a continuation of Russia’s confrontational approach to the West.<br />Political science and history tell us a lot about how authoritarian regimes start, persist and end. In highly personalized regimes like Mr. Putin’s Russia, rulers often fight to the bitter end, and the regime that follows typically isn’t democratic."
