    "body": "‘Gagarine,” showing in theaters in French, Romany and Russian with English subtitles, has its head in outer space and its feet on crumbling ground. It’s a piece of urban history seen through the lens of magic realism, a fragile but beguiling fantasy, tethered now and then to gritty reality, about a do-gooder doing the best he can against daunting odds.<br />The setting is Cité Gagarine, a huge public-housing project on the outskirts of Paris that was built by the local Communist government and named after Yuri Gagarin, the Soviet cosmonaut and the first human to travel into space. After its construction in the early 1960s the project was beset by chronic and then terminal decay. The story begins as demolition crews are about to move in. (In fact the project was condemned in 2014 and residents were forced to leave before the building was razed, starting in 2019. That sequence of events is chronicled in the film with documentary footage that includes Gagarine’s death by dynamite.)"
