    "body": "Western firms appear well insulated against the impact of the sanctions imposed this week on Russia. Whether global markets will fare as well isnâ€™t yet clear.<br />Major U.S. stock indexes have been relatively resilient, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both up at least 1.9% since Russia invaded Ukraine. Investors so far have been calm in the face of the conflict and many have used the opportunity offered by lower prices to buy. Data suggest that risks facing U.S. banks with exposure to the region are limited."
