    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”A jury convicted a Texas man of obstruction and other charges for riling up the mob on Jan. 6 last year, confronting police while armed and later threatening his children not to report him, in the first trial of one of the more than 750 people who face charges related to the U.S. Capitol attack by pro-Trump rioters.<br />While more than 200 others have pleaded guilty, hundreds more are fighting the charges. The verdict against Guy Reffitt could reverberate through many of the other cases as defendants weigh whether to take plea deals or continue to fight their charges."
