    "body": "A bankruptcy judge authorized Jones Day to continue representing  Johnson & Johnson ’s  talc subsidiary in chapter 11, rejecting arguments that the law firm can’t be trusted to look out for the interests of cancer victims because it designed the strategy to limit J&J’s liability.<br />Judge Michael Kaplan of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Trenton, N.J., said on Tuesday that Jones Day’s past work for J&J on a transaction that sent its talc-related liabilities into chapter 11 doesn’t mean the firm has a disqualifying conflict of interest, as injury lawyers allege."
