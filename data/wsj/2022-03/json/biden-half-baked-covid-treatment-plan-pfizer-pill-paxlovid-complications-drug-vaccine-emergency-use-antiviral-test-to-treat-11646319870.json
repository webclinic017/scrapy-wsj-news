    "body": "President Biden touted a new anti-Covid initiative in his State of the Union address Tuesday. “We’re also ready with antiviral treatments. If you get Covid-19, the  Pfizer  pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%,” he said. “And we’re launching the ‘Test to Treat’ initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.”<br />It’s a bad idea, and the president’s medical advisers should have steered him away from it."
