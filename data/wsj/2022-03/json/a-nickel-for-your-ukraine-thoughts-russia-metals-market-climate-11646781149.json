    "body": "Wars rarely go as planned and they invariably have collateral economic damage that surprises the unsuspecting. Thatâ€™s the story this week in the chaos in the market for nickel, a crucial metal used in electric-vehicle batteries, among other things.<br />The London Metal Exchange on Tuesday suspended trading in nickel, after the price soared 66% on Monday to more than $100,000 a metric ton. This was the first time the LME suspended trading in a metal since the international tin cartel collapsed in 1985. Russia is a major nickel producer, and traders are concerned about shortages in the metal from U.S. and European sanctions. Short-traders covering their positions also sent prices higher."
