    "body": "Modern signals monitoring means U.S. spooks can hardly store all the information they collect. So when Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted this week about intelligence he can’t describe that shed doubt on Vladimir Putin’s mental state, he may not have been referring to the work of CIA profilers but what Mr. Putin’s colleagues are saying in their undoubtedly copious exchanges.<br />Mr. Rubio has become our designated declassifier. He was the vehicle for a fleeting and obviously purposeful airing of Mr. Putin’s dirtiest, most secret laundry (to which I will return at the end) during a 2017 confirmation hearing with Rex Tillerson."
