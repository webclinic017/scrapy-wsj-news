    "body": "In “The House of Mirth,” Edith Wharton’s tragic tale of a beautiful young woman’s descent from privilege to poverty during the Gilded Age, the novel’s protagonist, Lily Bart, proclaims: “I want admiration, I want excitement, I want money—yes, money!”<br />Admiration, excitement and money were the ambitions, too, of Miriam Leslie, a real-life celebrity of the Gilded Age. Born illegitimate—and possibly biracial—in New Orleans in 1836, she rose to prominence as a writer, editor, publisher, fashion icon and champion social climber in New York society. Her fame was stoked by a series of scandals—sexual, financial, social. In the words of her biographer, Betsy Prioleau, she “kept gossip columnists busy.”"
