    "body": "A LOT HAS CHANGED since I last visited Hethel, in East Anglia, England, the historic home of Lotus Cars. But as I drove up the country lane to the factory, there was my friend Alastair Florance waiting in the rain to show me around. Good old Flo.<br />Mr. Florance and I have grown gray waiting for the day when Lotus finally built a fully fledged, no-excuses sports car, and now it’s here: the Emira. Almost. I happened to be in England a few weeks before the start of production; however, my host had arranged some wheel time with a late-stage engineering prototype of a V6 First Edition."
