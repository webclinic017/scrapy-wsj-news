    "body": "BOSTON—A new batch of emails filed in a Varsity Blues college-admissions fraud trial reveal that University of Southern California officials brazenly spoke of some families’ wealth and ability to donate while discussing applicants.<br />More than a dozen internal USC emails from 2013 to 2018 among top athletic-department officials and fundraisers portray staffers at times fixated on prospects’ bank accounts. A staffer added dollar signs in reference to a family in one email, and noted in another that a family needed to “pay up” before further favors would be granted."
