    "body": "New Covid-19 lockdowns in China dragged oil prices back below $100 a barrel, casting fresh uncertainty on a global economic expansion hamstrung by the war in Ukraine, rising inflation and the end of stimulus.<br />New York oil futures dropped 6.4% on Tuesday, extending their decline over the past week to more than 22%. Last week they exceeded $130 a barrel for the first time since the financial crisis, reflecting expectations that a war-related supply shock could be lasting. The trade was unraveled by cease-fire talks, bargain-hunting buyers of Russian oil in Asia and a reminder from China that the pandemic isnâ€™t over yet."
