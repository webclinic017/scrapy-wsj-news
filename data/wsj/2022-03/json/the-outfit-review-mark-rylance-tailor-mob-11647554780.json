    "body": "Al Capone knew that clothes made the mobster. While head of the Chicago Outfit, he considered launching his own fashion line—the Al Capone Collection—but worried that hawking silks would hem in his fearsome reputation. At his 1931 trial for tax evasion, federal prosecutors tried to weaponize his dandyism, trotting out his personal tailor who testified, in a not-so-subtle dig, that Capone’s favorite colors were green and canary. Nevertheless, Capone’s tailored suits remain the mafia’s signature silhouette, and it’s under their sharp-shouldered shadow that Graham Moore sets his “The Outfit,” a tidy and self-congratulatory little thriller about a clothier who fights back against the mob.<br />Mark Rylance stars as Leonard Burling, a Savile Row expat now operating a haberdashery in 1956 Chicago that caters primarily to the Irish mob. The film never leaves the shop, forcing us to become familiar with every crisply folded handkerchief and symbolic snow globe. It’s a suffocating warren of grays and browns, brightened only by a brassy receptionist named Mable (Zoey Deutch) sashaying around like a copycat of Joan Blondell. People can’t make sense of why a fastidious man like Leonard would flee the capital of posh grooming. “Jeans,” he groans, fingering James Dean as the trendsetter who kneecapped his London career."
