    "body": "I was delighted to read Stephen Budiansky’s review of my book “The Man from the Future” (Feb. 26), an intellectual biography of the Hungarian-American mathematical genius John von Neumann. I am flattered by the kind words from Mr. Budiansky, the most recent and honored biographer of Kurt Gödel, for my exposition of Gödel’s proof of the incompleteness theorem.<br />Mr. Budiansky is correct that “The Man from the Future” is not a traditional biography but a history of ideas that aims to explain Neumann’s incredible scientific contributions and place them in context so readers can appreciate their impact on our world. The deficiency Mr. Budiansky describes is a feature, not a bug."
