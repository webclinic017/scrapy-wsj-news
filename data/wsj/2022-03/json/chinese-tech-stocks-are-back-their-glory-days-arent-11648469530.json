    "body": "Don’t fight Beijing. That was the investment mantra behind the brutal, long-running selloff in Chinese technology stocks that began in late 2020. That belief is also why they have rebounded so strongly in the past couple of weeks: a marked change for the better in the tone from top Chinese policy makers.<br />Longer term, some key uncertainties are still hanging over the market. Namely, whether a return to the heady growth and cash generation of the pre-crackdown days is really possible. Based on the evidence so far, the answer still seems likely to be no."
