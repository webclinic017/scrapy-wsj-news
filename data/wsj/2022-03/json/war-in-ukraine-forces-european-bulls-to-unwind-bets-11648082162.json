    "body": "European stock indexes have largely clawed back losses suffered since President Vladimir Putin sent Russian troops into Ukraine. That doesnâ€™t necessarily mean traders are feeling optimistic.<br />Investors around the world say they are still looking skeptically at investing within the European continent, even though the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 is now hovering almost exactly where it closed the day before the invasion. The euro, meanwhile, has rebounded slightly from the nearly two-year low the currency reached earlier this month, closing Wednesday around $1.10."
