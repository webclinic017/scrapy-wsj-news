    "body": "PHILADELPHIA—House Democrats, facing setbacks to their economic agenda and intraparty fights, gathered a day later than planned in the city’s historic district Thursday to discuss how to hold on to their narrow majority.<br />Democrats face headwinds with voters, as President Biden’s low poll numbers are expected to weigh on House races. Inflation also continues to climb, and even-higher gasoline prices are feared after the Biden administration moved to end Russian oil imports in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The party in the White House also generally loses seats in the midterm election."
