    "body": "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has drawn parallels with a global flashpoint far to the east with the potential to set off an even more destructive conflict: Taiwan.<br />A self-ruled island of 24 million people roughly 100 miles off China’s southeastern coast, Taiwan is a vibrant democracy that, like Ukraine, has lived for years under the cloud of conflict with a vastly more powerful authoritarian neighbor. The war in Ukraine has rattled many in Taiwan, renewing interest in preparing to resist an invasion by China, which regards the island as a renegade province and has vowed to take control of it—if necessary, by force. Russia’s offensive likewise is offering lessons that China’s military, the People’s Liberation Army, can take on board should it decide to launch an assault across the Taiwan Strait."
