    "body": "The February jobs report is likely to do little to alter the Federal Reserveâ€™s plans to raise interest rates in two weeks, but a continued run of strong hiring points to further increases in borrowing costs this spring.<br />Employers added 678,000 jobs in February, and the unemployment rate declined to 3.8%, the lowest level since the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. economy two years ago, the Labor Department reported on Friday. Average hourly earnings were flat in February compared with January and rose by 5.1% from a year earlier."
