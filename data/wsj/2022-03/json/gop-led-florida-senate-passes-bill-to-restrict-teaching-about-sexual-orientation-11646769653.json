    "body": "MIAMI—The Florida Senate passed on Tuesday a bill that would restrict teaching about sexual orientation and gender identity in public schools, sending the measure to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has signaled his support for it.<br />Supporters of the legislation, led by Republicans who control the Senate, said it is aimed at asserting more parental control over children’s education and barring inappropriate content from the classroom. Democrats, civil-rights groups and other opponents say the measure, which they call the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, would censor discussion about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and isolate LGBT children who are vulnerable to bullying."
