    "body": "A Maryland judge blocked the state’s congressional map, saying the plan violated the state’s constitution and was drawn “to suppress the voice of Republican voters.”<br />Judge Lynne A. Battaglia struck down the map of U.S. congressional districts in an opinion issued Friday, saying it violated requirements for compactness and didn’t give due regard to political subdivisions. She also said the plan violated free elections, equal protection and free-speech clauses in the state’s constitution."
