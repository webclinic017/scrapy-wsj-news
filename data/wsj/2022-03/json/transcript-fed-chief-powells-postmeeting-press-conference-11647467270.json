    "body": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell discussed why the central bank raised interest rates, its outlook for how long it will take for inflation to ease, and plans for reducing the size of the Fed’s nearly $9 trillion balance sheet, during a press conference Wednesday after the latest monetary policy meeting. Here is a transcript of his comments.<br />JEROME H. POWELL: Good afternoon. I want to begin by acknowledging the tremendous hardship the Ukrainian people are suffering as a result of Russia’s invasion. The human toll is tragic. The financial and economic implications for the global economy and the U.S. economy are highly uncertain."
