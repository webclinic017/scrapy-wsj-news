    "body": "When I was in university in New York, my art history professors would occasionally touch on the clubhouses of artist groups. I’d perk up at whatever European cottage flitted across the projection screen, imagining an extended version of an artsy summer camp. But one got me truly jazzed: Charleston, the zany, craft-filled, maximalist farmhouse of the Bloomsbury group’s Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant, sited in the soft hills of East Sussex, England, so unlike the big-sky country of California where I grew up.<br />Bell and Grant, both painters and interior designers, were core members of the progressive group of artists, writers and intellectuals who originally congregated in London’s Bloomsbury neighborhood in the early 20th century. The duo took up residency at Charleston during World War I, nudged on by Bell’s younger sister and fellow Bloomsburian, author Virginia Woolf."
