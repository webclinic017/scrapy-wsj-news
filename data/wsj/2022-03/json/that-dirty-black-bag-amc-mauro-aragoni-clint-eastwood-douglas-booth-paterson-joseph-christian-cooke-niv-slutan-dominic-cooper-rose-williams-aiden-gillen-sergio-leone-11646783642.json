    "body": "Trapping a fly in a gun barrel? It’s a neat trick and not a bad way to open an eight-episode western. It establishes the dexterity of the gunman, as well as his patience. The buzz of the frantic insect rubs the silence raw. And it’s also a mischievous reference to that Sergio Leone classic “Once Upon a Time in the West,” in which an outlaw (Jack Elam) sends his own captive pest aloft just before another gunman (Charles Bronson) sends the outlaw to eternity.<br />A sequence very much the same occurs at the opening of “That Dirty Black Bag,” a very deliberate homage to/reboot of the “spaghetti westerns” of Leone (“A Fistful of Dollars,” “For a Few Dollars More,” etc.) though series creator Mauro Aragoni has to raise the ante to attain the same kind of shock value of the ’60s films. To wit, the black bag of the title is full of severed heads. As the title of episode 1 puts it, “A Head Weighs Less Than a Body”: As bounty hunter Red Bill (Douglas Booth) would argue—as he roams the parched, Leone-ish landscape collecting parts of wanted men—it’s just business. And freightage."
