    "body": "Srebrenica. Aleppo. Grozny. These are names etched in historical infamy as massacres conducted by marauding Serbs, Syrians and Russians. As his troops surround and bomb Ukraine’s cities, Vladimir Putin seems intent on adding Kharkiv, Mariupol, Kyiv and more to that bloody and shameful list.<br />Russia’s failure to topple the Kyiv government in a lightning strike has led to unwarranted optimism that Mr. Putin will lose this war. Ukrainians have fought splendidly, but Russian forces are still advancing in force on multiple fronts."
