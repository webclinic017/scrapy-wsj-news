    "body": "The aggressive sanctions against Russia left loopholes to allow payments of critical oil and gas supplies that fuel Europe—and the world’s—economies. But businesses are instead going beyond, slapping a toxic label on anything to do with Russia, shunning its oil, refusing to issue insurance and cutting off financial transactions even with entities not on the sanctions list.<br />The result is deeper financial pressure on Russia, potentially triggering bankruptcies in industries that can’t get access to cash or pay their bills. Other unintended consequences include higher prices for energy and crops like wheat, triggering greater inflation in the global economy."
