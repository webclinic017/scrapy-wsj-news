    "body": "AS A MEN’S fashion reporter, the question I get most often is: “Where can I get a good suit for cheap?” The asker usually spews this query in a panic: He has a wedding coming up, or a job interview looming, or his neighbor’s sister’s firstborn’s bar mitzvah is this weekend and he has nothing to wear.<br />The latter part of this question—the cheap bit—is easy to satisfy. The American retail landscape is flush with budget-suit stores. Never forget that before it was a designer playpen, Barneys New York started in 1923 as a discount suit emporium. I remember, as a kid in ’90s, trying on a chintzy navy suit in Syms, a now-defunct retailer known for suits that (in my recollection) cost about as much as a Happy Meal. Today, you can wander into any department store or fast fashion retailer and walk out with a suit for around $200."
