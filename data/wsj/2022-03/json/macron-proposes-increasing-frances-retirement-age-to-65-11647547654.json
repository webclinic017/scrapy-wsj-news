    "body": "PARIS—French President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday he planned to increase the legal retirement age to 65 from the current 62, raising a controversial issue three weeks before national elections.<br />Mr. Macron proposed an overhaul of the country’s pension system about two years ago, which led to a transport strike that lasted more than a month. The government shelved its plan when the Covid-19 pandemic hit."
