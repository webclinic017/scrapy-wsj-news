    "body": "I HAVE A THING for telescopes. Of the five islands listed here, three have major observatories that I came to visit—now two, since the 2020 collapse of the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico. And the night sky in Iceland is practically one big observatory, the universe in a fishbowl. In my experience, the Venn diagram containing the sets “island” and “fun roads” produces a pretty short list. Yes to Ireland. No to Borneo, Malta, Barbados, Sri Lanka. I include islands small enough that they could be reasonably circumnavigated but large and varied enough to justify several days driving.<br />Also, I only list places with adequate roadways and infrastructure for touring. Should you go to these places, please be mindful of the inhabitants’ driving culture. Sometimes—as in the case of Corsica—that may mean driving faster than you like, just to keep the grandmothers off your tail. Other islands have a different vibe. The slopes of Mauna Kea, on the Big Island of Hawaii, are sacred ground. The locals do not appreciate nimrods in rented 4x4s whooping over the Saddle Road. My apologies."
