    "body": "Americans shudder at the mention of nuclear war, especially by Vladimir Putin. This reaction is understandable—civilization is at stake—but it can obscure thinking about whether and how nuclear war between Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization might begin and proceed. Absent an informed assessment of this grave matter, U.S. policy makers likely would be gripped by visceral fear and avoid any action that could heighten the risk of nuclear war. Mr. Putin is showing he can manipulate these fears and thus avoid strong Western responses to his war crimes.<br />Russian doctrine on nuclear war is clear: Moscow has said it would consider initiating nuclear hostilities if Russian soil is attacked by nonnuclear weapons or the existence of the Russian state is in danger. Mr. Putin’s public statements since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine confirm this. He hasn’t said Russia would resort to nuclear weapons if NATO were to intervene in defense of Ukraine. Rather, he has restated that the threshold for Russian use of nuclear weapons would be “threats to our country.” Mr. Putin says NATO intervention in Ukraine could escalate to nuclear war, but not that Russia would use nuclear weapons in reaction to such intervention."
