    "body": "DUBAI—A tech industry is growing in Dubai, spurred by the pandemic, as startups here attract interest from international venture firms, including  SoftBank Group Corp.  and Sequoia Capital.<br />Dubai largely kept its border open, aggressively vaccinated and introduced visas and other policies that have attracted an increasingly mobile international workforce. With much of Europe and Asia launching lockdowns through multiple waves of Covid-19, Dubai’s mix of relaxed virus policies, low taxes and relatively light business regulation created an attractive environment for technology startups, executives said."
