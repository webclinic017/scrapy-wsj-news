    "body": "The implication in your editorial “A Chinese Nickel Market Mystery” (March 23) that the London Metal Exchange’s decisions were made based on the nationality of one of the world’s largest nickel producers, or as a result of pressure from any government, is wholly unfounded.<br />The situation in nickel is unprecedented, and trading was suspended to preserve the integrity of the market and prevent disorder. Cancellations were made retrospectively to take the market back to the last point in time at which it was operating in an orderly manner. Had the LME not taken these decisions, the effect on the nickel market would have been intensely damaging and felt throughout the nickel value chain and investment community."
