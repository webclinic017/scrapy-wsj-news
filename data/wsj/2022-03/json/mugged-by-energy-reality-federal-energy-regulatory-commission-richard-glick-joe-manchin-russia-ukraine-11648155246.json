    "body": "Federal regulators rarely backtrack, especially as quickly as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Yet on Thursday Democratic commissioners hit pause on a new policy requiring a greenhouse-gas analysis for natural gas pipelines and export projects. Good for them.<br />The commission last month voted 3-2 with Republicans in dissent to revise its policy for approving gas pipelines and export terminals. FERC by law must certify that projects are in the public interest and won’t have a significant environmental impact, but Democratic commissioners added greenhouse-gas emissions to their permission analyses. Their excuse was a court ruling that they claimed required the change, though it really doesn’t."
