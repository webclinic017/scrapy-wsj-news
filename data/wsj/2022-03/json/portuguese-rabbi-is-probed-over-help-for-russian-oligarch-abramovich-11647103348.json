    "body": "A global effort scrutinizing one of Russia’s richest men, Roman Abramovich, ricocheted outward, ensnaring a rabbi in Portugal, sowing confusion over the sales process of the billionaire’s British soccer team and freezing some of his U.S.-held funds.<br />Mr. Abramovich was sanctioned Thursday by U.K. authorities, who allege he received preferential treatment from Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was part of the latest salvo of restrictions and sanctions targeting Russian banks, exports and individuals in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine."
