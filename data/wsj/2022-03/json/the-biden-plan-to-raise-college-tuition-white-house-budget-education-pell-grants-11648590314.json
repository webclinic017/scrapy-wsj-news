    "body": "Tuition has soared as colleges have raised prices to soak up more government subsidies. Has no one explained this to President Biden? His budget proposes to double the federal Pell Grant, which would drive tuition even higher.<br />“Pell Grants have been the foundation of low- and moderate-income students’ financial aid for decades,” the Education Department budget says. “However, the value has diminished as college costs continue to rise.” The Administration’s response is to increase the maximum Pell Grant next year to $8,670 from $6,495 and double it by the end of the decade."
