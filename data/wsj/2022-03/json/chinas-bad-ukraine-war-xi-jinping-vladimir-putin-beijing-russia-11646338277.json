    "body": "Friday marks a month since Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian strongman Vladimir Putin signed a declaration that there are “no limits” to their friendship. Pardon Mr. Xi if he’s already concluding that with friends like this he doesn’t need enemies.<br />Little about Mr. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is going right for Beijing. One of the bigger disasters so far concerns the fate of Chinese citizens in Ukraine. Speculation is rampant over whether Mr. Putin warned his Chinese counterpart an invasion was imminent. Either way, Beijing didn’t evacuate its embassy or the Chinese citizens now struggling to escape Mr. Putin’s tanks and bombs."
