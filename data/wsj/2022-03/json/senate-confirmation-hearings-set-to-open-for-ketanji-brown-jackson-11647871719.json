    "body": "WASHINGTON—Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson ended the first day of her Senate confirmation hearings by saying she hoped to embody the “skill and integrity, civility and grace” of Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, whom she clerked for and now seeks to succeed.<br />“I know that my role as a judge is a limited one,“ Judge Jackson said on Monday after each member of the Senate Judiciary Committee had made an opening statement. “That the Constitution empowers me only to decide cases and controversies that are properly presented. And I know my judicial role is further constrained by careful adherence to precedent.”"
