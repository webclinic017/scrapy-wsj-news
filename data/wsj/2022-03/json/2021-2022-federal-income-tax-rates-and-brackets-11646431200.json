    "body": "The tax code currently has seven income-tax brackets for individuals that range from 10% to 37%. The 10% rate takes effect at the first dollar of taxable income, after benefits such as the standard deduction are applied. Each tax rate applies to income in that bracket. So a taxpayer whose last dollars are taxed at 24% will likely have portions of income taxed at 0, 10%, 12% and 22%.<br />The current rates and brackets were set by the 2017 tax overhaul, and they expire at the end of 2025. If Congress doesnâ€™t make changes, the top rate will return to 39.6% in 2026."
