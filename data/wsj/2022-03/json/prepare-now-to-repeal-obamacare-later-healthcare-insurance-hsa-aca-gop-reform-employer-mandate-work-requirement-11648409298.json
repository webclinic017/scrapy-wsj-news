    "body": "After Sen. John McCain’s thumbs-down vote doomed Republican efforts to repeal ObamaCare in 2017, the party’s leadership largely abandoned the effort and shifted to other topics. Congress zeroed out the individual-mandate penalty as part of its tax-cut legislation; Republican attorneys general tried unsuccessfully to use that action to convince the courts to repeal the law; President Trump promised to replace ObamaCare with a better plan. Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy offered their own plan, but Republican leaders never brought it to the floor and seemed happier to forget the entire healthcare topic.<br />Republicans need to be better prepared the next time they control both chambers of Congress and the White House. President Biden’s sinking poll numbers and Democratic infighting may give them that opportunity in three years. To avoid another failure at repealing ObamaCare, Republicans need to convince voters that they have a viable replacement."
