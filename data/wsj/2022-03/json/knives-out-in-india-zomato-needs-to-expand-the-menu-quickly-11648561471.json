    "body": "India’s food ordering platform  Zomato  has had an interesting two weeks. It launched its own pilot to deliver food within 10 minutes. It is reportedly considering gobbling up a separate instant grocery delivery service. And its stock price hit its lowest level since the company’s July market debut.<br />Like many U.S. tech firms before it, the company needs to spend money to keep customers and drivers in its ecosystem, expand its offerings—and hopefully, eventually make money. But unlike its local competition, it is already a publicly traded company."
