    "body": "President Biden nominated Sarah Bloom Raskin to be the Federal Reserve’s vice chairman for bank supervision because she wants to use financial regulation to redirect capital from fossil fuels. She’s the wrong person for the wrong job at the wrong time, as Joe Manchin explained in his own words Monday in saying he opposes her nomination.<br />“Now more than ever, the United States must have policy leaders and economic experts who are focused on the most pressing issues facing the American people and our nation—specifically rising inflation and energy costs,” the West Virginia Senator said. Ms. Raskin’s “previous public statements have failed to satisfactorily address my concerns about the critical importance of financing an all-of-the-above energy policy to meet our nation’s critical energy needs.”"
