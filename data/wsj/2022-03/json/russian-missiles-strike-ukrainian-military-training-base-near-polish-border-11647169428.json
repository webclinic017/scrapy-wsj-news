    "body": "A Russian airstrike killed 35 people at a Ukrainian military training center about 10 miles from the Polish border early Sunday, one day after Moscow warned the West that it would consider arms deliveries to Ukraine as legitimate targets.<br />Eight missiles hit the facility at Yavoriv, a base where until last month the U.S. National Guard trained Ukrainian troops. Shortly after the strike, ambulances were seen rushing toward the base, and troops were seen leaving."
