    "body": "It took a 72-year-old designer to wake up the luxury fashion establishment. Miuccia  Prada ,  one of its queens, sent a jarring new silhouette down the runway for her spring Miu Miu collection, shown in Paris in October 2021. There were several iterations, but the gist of it was an ultra-low-rise pleated miniskirt (so short the pockets peek out) paired with a teensy crop top. Some tops were abbreviated sweaters or button-ups; others appeared to be the waistband of a pair of pants, refashioned into a bra-like band. The look was preppy, yet naughty; think early 2000s Avril Lavigne with a pop of Ivy League nostalgia. It captured the current Y2K-obsessed, pandemic-fatigued party-girl aesthetic that thrives online.<br />“It’s become a meme,” said AJ Tinsley, 24, an Irish fashion designer living in London, who posted his own DIY version of the outfit to TikTok."
