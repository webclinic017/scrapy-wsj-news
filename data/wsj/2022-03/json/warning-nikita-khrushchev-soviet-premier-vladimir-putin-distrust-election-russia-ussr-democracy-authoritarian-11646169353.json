    "body": "The voice, from more than 60 years ago, was remarkably clear and, to my ears, instantly recognizable. “I’m very happy to welcome you boys and girls to the first assembly of the 1960-61 school year,” said Floyd V. Stolzenburg, principal of Cassingham Elementary School in Bexley, Ohio.<br />A buddy of mine from those days had found the old reel-to-reel tape in a box. As a child he had been a member of the school’s audiovisual club and a volunteer projectionist for the noon movies (“Our Friend, the Atom”) in the auditorium. In autumn 1960 he had lugged his bulky Wollensak tape machine to that auditorium to record Floyd Stolzenburg’s speech."
