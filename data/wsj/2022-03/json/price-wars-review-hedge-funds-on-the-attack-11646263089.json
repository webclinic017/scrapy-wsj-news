    "body": "Albert Einstein looked for a theoretical framework to tie up the universe but didn’t succeed. Rupert Russell, a British filmmaker and writer, believes he has done it. In “Price Wars: How the Commodities Markets Made Our Chaotic World,” Mr. Russell reduces much recent history to a morality play in which global financial capitalism wreaks chaos on the developing world.<br />The author, who traveled to Iraq, Ukraine, Venezuela, Somalia and other hot spots for his research, attempts to link “disparate episodes of chaos large and small.” His thesis is that far-flung events over the past two decades or so were not “free-floating snowflakes but bound together in an avalanche.”"
