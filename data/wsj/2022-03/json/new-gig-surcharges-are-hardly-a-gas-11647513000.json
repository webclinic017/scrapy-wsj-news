    "body": "Your gig-platform spending is about to shift higher.<br />U.S. regular unleaded gas prices now average $4.30 a gallon, up around 20% from mid-February and about 50% compared with a year ago, according to GasBuddy. With gig-economy drivers generally expected to pay for their own gas, platforms are now working on ways to compensate drivers for the increased costs. Both  Uber Technologies  and  Lyft  have announced in recent days that they will temporarily add surcharges to help their drivers recoup some of the cost of skyrocketing gas. Meanwhile, Just Eat Takeaway-owned Grubhub raised the per-mile pay for all its delivery partners last week and is also offering additional pay based on the estimated total miles driven each week. And  DoorDash  said in a blog post Tuesday that it will add weekly cash bonuses for drivers who log a certain number of miles."
