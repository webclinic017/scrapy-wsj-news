    "body": "A shift to remote-work arrangements is showing signs of boosting the lagging share of women in the labor force as the economy recovers from the pandemic. That is a good thing for U.S. economic growth and productivity, although economists say that workers who never come back to the office risk isolating themselves from promotions and networking opportunities.<br />Companies are increasingly offering remote and hybrid work arrangements as a perk to hire workers, particularly at larger firms, and women appear to be embracing the flexibility. A February survey of job seekers by hiring platform  ZipRecruiter Inc.  found that women were twice as likely as men, 26% versus 13%, to say they were only looking for remote work."
