    "body": "A year ago this month, Mschf, a teeny Brooklyn design firm and art collective, released what are generally considered the most viral sneakers of 2021: Satan Shoes. Priced at $1,018, these modified, black-and-red  Nike  Air Max sneakers, which allegedly had a drop of blood in the soles, sold fast and caught fire on the internet as reporters at  CBS ,  TMZ, People and, yes, The Wall Street Journal covered their every demonic detail. Within days, Nike—unwilling to let its name be sullied by controversial, unauthorized shoes—filed a trademark infringement suit against Mschf.<br />The parties settled out of court and Mschf agreed to buy back all the sneakers from customers at their original price. In the end, Satan Shoes proved better at going viral than making the company money."
