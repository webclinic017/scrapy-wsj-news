    "body": "Thomas Yuen was working in 1980 as an electrical engineer in Southern California when his kidneys failed and he learned he would require dialysis treatments for the rest of his life. The news gave him two things: a sudden need to earn much more money than he was making, and a drive to seize what life he had left.<br />Shortly afterward, Mr. Yuen co-founded AST Research, a technology hardware maker that got its start making expansion cards for  International Business Machines â€™ first personal computer. The cards added memory, a clock, storage and several ports to early computers, and were an instant hit, former colleagues said. Mr. Yuen and his co-founders, Albert Wong and Safi Qureshey, grew the company from a tiny office routinely rattled by landing airplanes into a Fortune 500 manufacturer with revenues of $1.14 billion by 1992."
