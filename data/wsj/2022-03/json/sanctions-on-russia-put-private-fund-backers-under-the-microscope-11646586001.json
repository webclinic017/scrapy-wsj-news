    "body": "Private investment firms are scouring the lists of their fund investors to ensure they don’t run afoul of new sanctions against Russian oligarchs, government officials and others in response to their country’s invasion of Ukraine.<br />For smaller firms that might lack the expertise, technology and money needed to conduct thorough background checks of their investors, particularly wealthy individuals and family offices, the new sanctions represent a significant challenge, lawyers, consultants and former regulators say.
