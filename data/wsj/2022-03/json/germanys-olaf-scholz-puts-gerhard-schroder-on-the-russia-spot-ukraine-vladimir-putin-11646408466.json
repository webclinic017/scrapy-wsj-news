    "body": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is undertaking nothing short of a revolution for his country’s foreign and security policy in the wake of Vladimir Putin’s Ukraine invasion. Evidence that Mr. Scholz is serious came Thursday as he tackled his own party’s biggest Russia embarrassment.<br />That is the person of Gerhard Schröder, former chancellor. Mr. Schröder, like Mr. Scholz a member of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), has spent the years since leaving office in 2005 as a highly paid political fixer and brand ambassador for Russian energy companies. He is chairman of  Rosneft ,  was appointed last month to the board of  Gazprom ,  and holds senior posts with companies responsible for the Nord Stream 1 and 2 natural-gas pipelines."
