    "body": "If the perfect is the enemy of the good, it’s banished joyously in “Turning Red,” a Pixar release streaming on Disney+, and a debut feature by Domee Shi.<br />As the first woman to direct a Pixar short, Ms. Shi won an Oscar in 2019 for her affecting and memorably strange “Bao.” (A childless woman crafts a dumpling that comes to life as her chubby-cheeked baby boy.) Now the Chinese-Canadian filmmaker, who wrote the screenplay with Julia Cho, has created a wonderful full-length film, set in the early 2000s, around 13-year-old Meilin “Mei” Lee, a Toronto schoolgirl voiced by Rosalie Chiang. The dutiful daughter of a perfectionist mother, Ming (Sandra Oh), Mei is an overachiever who may well become a United Nations secretary-general, as her mom expects. Before taking office, though, she needs to release the wild animal of her inner adolescent, which she does in spectacular fashion."
