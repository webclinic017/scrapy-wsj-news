    "body": "WASHINGTONâ€”A new payroll system at the State Department introduced last year is causing thousands of U.S. diplomats, including some working in war zones, to struggle with problems receiving their salary, according to interviews and documents.<br />Diplomats say they have had to spend time tracking down payments instead of doing their jobs, and that a lack of urgency among leadership is hurting morale. U.S. diplomats working in war zones and other high-risk locations are often among those affected, because their paychecks include extra pay for taking on dangerous and difficult roles."
