    "body": "NEW DELHI—Prime Minister Narendra Modi led his party to a resounding electoral victory in India’s most populous state, showing his enduring popularity despite protests over a proposed farming overhaul and an economy that has struggled to recover from the pandemic.<br />The win for Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, set the stage for his widely expected run for a third term in 2024. The BJP was on course to win nearly two-thirds of the legislative seats in Uttar Pradesh, one of five states electing legislative assemblies, according to preliminary results. It is the first time in decades that voters have returned an incumbent party to power in Uttar Pradesh. The BJP was also on track to win a majority in three other states—Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur."
