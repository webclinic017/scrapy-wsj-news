    "body": "It seems the Biden administration thinks the Ukrainians might use Poland’s MiG-29s to attack Russia rather than defend its own airspace or attack Russian ground forces in Ukraine. The administration also seems to think it knows better than Ukrainians about what Ukraine needs to defend itself (“The Ukraine MiG-29 Fiasco Gets Worse,” Review & Outlook, March 11).<br />The people who say that the Polish MiGs would be of little value must either have forgotten what they learned as fighter wing commanders or they never had that privilege. Mission-capable rates in the U.S. Air Force seldom rise above 70%. That means at least 3 in every 10 aircraft need maintenance, and most of those need some kind of part. Every one of those Polish MiGs is a three-wheeled parts bin that could be used to repair a Ukrainian MiG that is down for parts."
