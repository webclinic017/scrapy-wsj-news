    "body": "U.S. stock futures wavered and oil prices jumped, extending a volatile stretch for markets as investors assessed developments from the war in Ukraine.<br />Futures for major U.S. indexes struggled to find direction early Friday and shifted between small gains and losses. The S&P 500 added 0.3%, while contracts for the technology-focused Nasdaq-100 advanced 0.3%. Those for the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%. U.S. stocks fell Thursday after cease-fire talks between Russia and Ukraine yielded little progress and data showed U.S. inflation in February reached a four-decade high. All three indexes are on track for weekly losses of 1.3% or more."
