    "body": "<br />There are many distractions in and around the eight-episode epic “Pachinko,” including a multigenerational storyline, a multinational production and a multitude of characters, but what lingers on the palate is the credit sequence—which is not a good thing, even if the strategy behind it is logical. Set to a version of the old Grass Roots hit “Let’s Live for Today,” it features the principal characters, gathered from the 1900s to the 1980s, dancing through an arcade/casino (as suggested by the title), and creating a kind of overage K-pop dance party. Given the somber nature of most of Min Jin Lee’s popular and in many quarters beloved novel on which the series is based, it feels as if the show is using the recurring sequence as an antidote for itself."
