    "body": "The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries believes there is nothing it can do to stop rising oil prices, as it decided again Thursday to stick with a Moscow-backed production plan that has done nothing to tame the  market during the Ukraine war.<br />In their second meeting since the Kremlin ordered the assault on Ukraine, a partnership between OPEC and a group of Russia-led countries, dubbed OPEC+, declined again to tap into its millions of barrels of remaining capacity to pump more oil. Instead, they agreed to raise their collective oil output by a modest 432,000 barrels a day, rejecting calls from oil-consuming countries to do more."
