    "body": "Pat Brown, California’s governor from 1959 to 1967, helped make the University of California the world’s pre-eminent public university system. In 1970 he said that he had given “the highest priority to education, because I felt the greatness of California would depend upon an educated people.” That same year, Gov. Ronald Reagan signed the first holistic environmental-review statute enacted by a state—the California Environmental Quality Act, or CEQA.<br />The law was intended to ensure that consideration of environmental impact would be a part of the government’s approval process for construction projects. While it has done that, plaintiff attorneys and their clients have made an art of extracting concessions from developers or stopping projects altogether—often for reasons that have little or nothing to do with the environment."
