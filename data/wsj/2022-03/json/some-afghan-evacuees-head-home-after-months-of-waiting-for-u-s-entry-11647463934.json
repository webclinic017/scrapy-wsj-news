    "body": "WASHINGTON—Dozens of Afghans who were evacuated to the United Arab Emirates as the Taliban seized power last summer are volunteering to be sent back despite the danger of reprisals so they can support families left behind,  evacuees say.<br />One Afghan evacuee who worked at Kabul airport said in an interview from Afghanistan, where he returned last week, that U.S. military officials promised him shelter in America in return for his help with the evacuation effort. Afghan evacuees often were the primary breadwinners for extended families left behind and hoped to quickly begin working in order to send money home."
