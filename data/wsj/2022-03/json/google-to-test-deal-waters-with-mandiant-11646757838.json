    "body": "In going after  Mandiant ,  Google parent  Alphabet  is essentially betting on its ability to look small.<br />That’s no easy task for a company currently valued near $1.7 trillion. Especially since the $5.4 billion in cash Google is laying out for the cybersecurity provider counts as the company’s second-largest deal ever—after its $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility in 2011. The Mandiant transaction announced Tuesday is also more than double the size of Google’s Fitbit acquisition, which was announced in November of 2019 but took more than 14 months to close due to a high level of government scrutiny."
