    "body": "President Biden’s “billionaire minimum income tax,” which the White House announced Monday as part of its 2023 budget, is a serious tax-reform proposal. By proposing a large broadening of the tax base, which would raise revenue in a fair and efficient manner from high-income households, this plan could solve many of the problems that have bedeviled earlier approaches to taxing the income from wealth.<br />Currently taxes are collected on capital gains only when an asset is sold, not when an asset increases in value. This matches the payment of taxes with the cash that is generated to pay those taxes. But waiting to tax until gains are realized through the sale of an asset has three major disadvantages. First, linking taxation to realization encourages people to hold on to assets. These gains escape taxation at death, which turbocharges the incentive not to sell and prevents capital from flowing freely to those who can make the best use of it."
