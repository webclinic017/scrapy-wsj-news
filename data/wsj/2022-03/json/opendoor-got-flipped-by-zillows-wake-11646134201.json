    "body": "This supposed ten-bagger now has twice the upside. But it may have twice the risk, too.<br />Shares of  Opendoor Technologies  are down 24% since the residential-property home flipper reported fourth-quarter results Thursday and by more than half since Chamath Palihapitiya’s shell company, Social Capital Hedosophia II, announced a merger in September 2020. Back then, Mr. Palihapitiya called Opendoor, which subsequently went public, his next “10x idea” in an interview with CNBC."
