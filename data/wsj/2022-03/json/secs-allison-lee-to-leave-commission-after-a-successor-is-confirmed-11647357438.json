    "body": "WASHINGTON—One of the three Democrats on the Securities and Exchange Commission, Allison Lee, said Tuesday that she intends to depart the agency once a successor has been confirmed by the Senate.<br />Ms. Lee, a former SEC enforcement attorney who was sworn in as a commissioner in 2019, would be eligible to continue serving for about 18 months after her term ends in June. But she has privately signaled for at least a year that she didn’t intend to stretch her term or seek reappointment, people familiar with her plans say."
