    "body": "Ford ’s  move to give its electric-vehicle business its own identity is about engineering of a cultural rather than financial kind, but that might change.<br />The car maker said Wednesday that it would create a new division, Ford Model e, to house the small and unprofitable, but fast-growing, EV business responsible for the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning. The unit will have its own profit-and-loss account from next year, sitting alongside two other new segments: the conventional consumer-vehicle division, renamed Ford Blue, and Ford Pro for fleet customers."
