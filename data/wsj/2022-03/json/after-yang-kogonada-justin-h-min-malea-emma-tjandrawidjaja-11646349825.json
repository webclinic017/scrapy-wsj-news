    "body": "This is a good week for new takes on older themes. In addition to “The Batman,” with its running time of 175 minutes, we have “After Yang,” a second feature by the Korean-American filmmaker who calls himself Kogonada. In a mere 96 minutes this film, playing in theaters, turns familiar tropes about machine learning into an exquisite fable that reveals its beauty slowly, almost meditatively, and ever so tenderly.<br />Yang (Justin H. Min) is the machine of the piece. He’d be indistinguishable from a handsome young human if he weren’t so unswervingly kind, gentle, patient, charming and devoted to the task he was purchased for—serving as a big brother to an only child who was adopted from China by overworked Western parents, and helping her connect to her Chinese heritage with a steady supply of facts that he dispenses like a post-doc Alexa. (Her name is Mika, and she’s played endearingly by 10-year-old Malea Emma Tjandrawidjaja.)"
