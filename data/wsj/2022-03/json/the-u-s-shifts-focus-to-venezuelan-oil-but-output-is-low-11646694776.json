    "body": "BOGOTA, Colombia—Even as the U.S. considers lifting sanctions so Venezuela gets oil flowing, the reality is that the country’s oil sector is ill-prepared to start churning out more crude and lower fast-rising oil prices amid the Ukraine war.<br />Years of mismanagement, corruption and nationalization of oil ventures caused Venezuela’s oil industry—which in the 1990s produced 3.2 million barrels a day—to crash by 2020, when output fell to just one-tenth of what it had been. Production has now more than doubled to about 800,000 barrels a day but that is less than 1% of the 100 million barrels dozens of countries produce world-wide daily."
