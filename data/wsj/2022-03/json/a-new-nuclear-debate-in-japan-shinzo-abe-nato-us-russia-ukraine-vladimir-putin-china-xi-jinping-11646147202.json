    "body": "Whatever else Chinese President Xi Jinping thought he’d accomplish through his entente with Vladimir Putin, a nuclear Japan surely wasn’t on the list. Yet the global disorder the pair are stoking may prompt a security rethink in Tokyo, as former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe demonstrated this weekend.<br />Mr. Abe on Sunday suggested Japan should consider a nuclear-sharing arrangement with the U.S. similar to NATO. Various European countries allow the U.S. to house American nuclear weapons on their soil as part of NATO’s deterrence. Japan shelters under America’s nuclear umbrella but has insisted the weapons be placed elsewhere."
