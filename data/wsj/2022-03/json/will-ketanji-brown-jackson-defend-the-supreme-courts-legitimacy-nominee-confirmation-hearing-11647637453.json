    "body": "Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will hear many questions during her Supreme Court confirmation hearings next week, but senators should emphasize a fundamental one: What makes the court “legitimate” in our constitutional system?<br />A confirmation hearing usually focuses on long-disputed cases such as Roe v. Wade, controversies of the moment, or doctrinal questions like the weight of precedent. But the Roberts court’s most vocal critics have been making the court itself an issue. In December, Sen. Elizabeth Warren published an op-ed disputing “the legitimacy of every action the current court takes.” Two years earlier, several of her fellow senators filed a friend-of-the-court brief in a Second Amendment case in which they asserted that the court is “not well” and could be “restructured.” Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, claimed last month that “the Supreme Court majority has zero legitimacy.”"
