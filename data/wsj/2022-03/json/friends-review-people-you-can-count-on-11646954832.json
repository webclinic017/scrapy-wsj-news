    "body": "One of the many unsettling effects of the pandemic is the way it winnowed out our real-world friendships. The first to go were the casual relationships, the people you saw every day at the office or gym, and with whom you formed a warm bond over the years. When public spaces closed down, these friendships vanished. Next to go were the longstanding friends you might have invited over for a meal a few times a year. You might have gone to a movie or a concert together, but you wouldn’t ask them for a loan or to drive you to the emergency room. Those favors were reserved for the most intimate relationships—immediate family members and perhaps one or two very close friends.<br />This core group can withstand almost any insult, including distance, disputes and even the strictures and losses of a pandemic. While my core group stood firm, I watched other relationships fall away like dead leaves on my houseplants. Given the ease of a call and the ubiquity of social media, I wondered why this was happening."
