    "body": "To figure out where inflation is headed, don’t look at the overall economy, look under the hood.<br />Inflation surged from 2.5% in January 2021 to 7.5% in January 2022 and could edge even higher as the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is felt on oil prices. But economists expect inflation to fall to between 2.7% and the upper-4% range by December."
