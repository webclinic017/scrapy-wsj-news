    "body": "Regarding Jeb Hensarling’s op-ed “Debt and Inflation Threaten U.S. Security” (Feb. 23): There is no causal connection between the rate of inflation and the deficit or the level of outstanding Treasury obligations. There has been a deficit in each of the past 20 years, adding to the growing national debt. In most years there was negligible inflation.<br />Debt alarmists cite the national debt as a percentage of GDP. But what counts is the ability of the international bond market (estimated to be $125 trillion) to absorb easily new Treasury issues that are a fraction of its size."
