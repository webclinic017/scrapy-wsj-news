    "body": "Wars perplex investors. I’m always slow to react. Back in my days as a Wall Street analyst at  Morgan Stanley ,  we would bus top investors around Silicon Valley to see  Apple ,   Intel ,   Adobe ,  plus Jim Clark at Silicon Graphics, Scott McNealy at Sun Microsystems and even Steve Jobs at NeXT. Breakfast on Aug. 2, 1990, was disrupted by news of Iraqi tanks rolling into Kuwait. Even though the 1990s proved to be paradise for technology, most investors rushed back to New York. The stock market dropped 6% over three days.<br />My office in Manhattan was next to Wall Street’s top oil analyst. That fall, he studied data from the world’s producers and spoke at Morgan Stanley’s morning meeting. Armed with tables and charts, he basically declared that world demand was X million barrels a day, but without Iraq, there was only Y amount of oil production, so prices were going to rise for the next decade. Sound familiar? I watched salesmen peel out of the room to call their clients. It turns out he was spectacularly wrong."
