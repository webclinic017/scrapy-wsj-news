    "body": "SÃO PAULO—A Brazilian Supreme Court justice on Friday ordered the suspension of the messaging app Telegram as police investigate its use by some far-right supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro to disseminate false information ahead of October’s presidential elections.<br />Justice Alexandre de Moraes gave Brazil’s telecom regulator 24 hours to take the necessary measures to shut down Telegram after he said the platform failed to comply with previous judicial orders. Those included directing the blocking of the accounts of Bolsonaro supporters the court accuses of spreading disinformation about Covid-19 and organizing underground campaigns to incite violence against Supreme Court justices."
