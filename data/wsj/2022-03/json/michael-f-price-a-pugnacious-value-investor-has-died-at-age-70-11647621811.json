    "body": "Michael F. Price built a reputation as a savvy investor in the 1980s and 1990s by finding value where others overlooked it and prodding chief executives to take action to boost their share prices.<br />He bought beat-down securities in companies going through bankruptcy and invested in takeover situations. His early moves into mining stocks paid off richly in the 1970s. His funds typically produced dazzling returns, despite occasional missteps, such as a bet on  R.H. Macy  & Co. in the 1980s."
