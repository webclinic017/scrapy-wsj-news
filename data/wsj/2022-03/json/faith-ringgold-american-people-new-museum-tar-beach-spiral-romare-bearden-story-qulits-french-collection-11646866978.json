    "body": "New York<br />The art world of the early 1960s that a young Faith Ringgold confronted had no place for her. As a black artist, she found no home in New York’s commercial gallery scene, which was almost exclusively white. As a woman, she was declined entry to Spiral, the prominent African-American arts collective founded by Romare Bearden and others who were dubbed the “old men of Black art.” In the years and decades that followed, Ms. Ringgold would forge her own place in the contentious world of art while navigating the broader political tumult of the day—no easy feat, yet one she pulled off with stunning creativity as witnessed by “Faith Ringgold: American People” at the New Museum."
