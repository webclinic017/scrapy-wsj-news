    "body": "As a Ukrainian-American, I feel torn between anger and shame. Anger at the continuing massacre of thousands of Ukrainians by the Russian military as it targets civilians. Shame because the U.S. could do much more to stop this indiscriminate slaughter.<br />America must stop Vladimir Putin now to avoid the worst catastrophe in Europe since World War II. If Washington doesn’t act decisively, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians will die, and other countries may be invaded as well. The U.S. has underestimated Mr. Putin’s appetite too many times, and Washington’s leniency has given him the confidence to commit the war crimes we see in the news today."
