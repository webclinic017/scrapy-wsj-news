    "body": "WARSAW—Local governments can’t buy beds fast enough. Poles who offer to host refugees get more than 100 emails from newcomers looking for a place to sleep, often full of details of their ordeal. The flood of people has raised Poland’s population for the first time since 1987.<br />Europe is facing its biggest refugee crisis since World War II. In the nearly two weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine, more than two million people have fled to the European Union, with no end in sight. The overwhelming majority are descending on countries in the EU’s east. Officials are scrambling to expand housing, schools and social services for an influx of people expected to grow by millions more."
