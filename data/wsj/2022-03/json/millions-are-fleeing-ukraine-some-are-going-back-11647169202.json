    "body": "PRZEMYSL, Poland—Just two weeks ago, Yulia Rabievska and her mother Ira frantically threw their possessions into bags and fled Ukraine ahead of invading Russian forces. They reached Poland after three days on the road with Yulia’s 6-year-old son, her sister and her nephew.<br />But on Friday, Ira went back into war-torn Ukraine, ignoring Yulia’s pleading that she remain. She joined a steady stream of Ukrainians heading home, going against the epic wave of refugees fleeing the country."
