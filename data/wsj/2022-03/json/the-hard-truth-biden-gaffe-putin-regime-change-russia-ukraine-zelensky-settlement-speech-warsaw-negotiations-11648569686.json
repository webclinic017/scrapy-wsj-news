    "body": "The journalist Michael Kinsley famously proposed that “a gaffe is when a politician tells the truth—some obvious truth he isn’t supposed to say.” By this standard, the ad libbed final sentence of President Biden’s Warsaw speech may be a gaffe for the ages. Administration officials scurried to walk back the suggestion that regime change in Russia was among the objectives of U.S. assistance to Ukraine. America’s NATO ambassador, Julianne Smith, suggested (plausibly enough) that Mr. Biden’s words represented “a principled human reaction” to his encounter earlier in the day with hundreds of desperate Ukrainian refugees.<br />Mr. Biden’s impromptu remark, which dominated coverage of an otherwise strong speech, raises a larger question: Is it conceivable that the rest of the world can return to business as usual with Vladimir Putin as Russia’s president, or must he and his country be treated as international pariahs so long as he remains in power?"
