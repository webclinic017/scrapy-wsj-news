    "body": "Katy Perry won an appeal over a long-running copyright-infringement lawsuit, affirming that the musician and her record label don’t have to pay $2.8 million in damages.<br />The lawsuit, first filed in 2014, alleged that Ms. Perry’s song “Dark Horse” copied the repeated instrumentals in “Joyful Noise,” a song by Christian hip-hop artist Flame, whose given name is Marcus Gray. A jury awarded Mr. Gray and the song’s two other writers $2.8 million in damages, but a district court later voided that award. Mr. Gray appealed in 2020."
