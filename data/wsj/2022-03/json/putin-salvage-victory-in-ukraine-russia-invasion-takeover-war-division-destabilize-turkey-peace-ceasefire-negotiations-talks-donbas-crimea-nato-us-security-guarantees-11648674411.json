    "body": "The year I served in east Ukraine as a cease-fire monitor was framed by dramatic events. I arrived in September 2014, shortly after a Malaysia Airlines flight was shot down by a Russian missile above the Donbas. I left in September 2015, as Russia switched its military attention to Syria. Russia was then fighting only in Ukraine’s eastern regions, but that first incarnation of the Russia-Ukraine war has lessons for today.<br />Russia has shown that no matter how badly things go, it can find a way to impose its influence on Ukraine. In 2014 Russia annexed Crimea but the uprisings it inspired in Odessa and Kharkiv fizzled, while its separatist republics in Donetsk and Luhansk gained only incomplete footholds in these regions. Yet that was enough to destabilize Ukraine: Russia’s proxies waged a limited war in the Donbas for eight years, giving Vladimir Putin his veneer-thin justification for invading this February."
