    "body": "Russia passed a law that threatens prison time for anyone publishing what authorities consider to be false information about the country’s invasion of Ukraine, which the Kremlin refers to as a special military operation.<br />The law—a change to the country’s criminal code, which the lower chamber of Russia’s parliament approved on Friday—says anyone found guilty of knowingly disseminating false information and data about the use of Russia’s armed forces would be punished by a prison sentence of up to 15 years or a fine of up to 1.5 million rubles, equivalent to about $14,000. Reporting data on Russia’s military casualties not provided by the Russian Defense Ministry would also be considered a violation."
