    "body": "It’s been almost 50 years since I’ve thought of Horatius at the bridge. As a student at Loyola Academy, a Jesuit high school in Wilmette, Ill., I was required to study Latin. My teacher for three of those four years was the mellifluously named Vito Volino. We called him “Magister”—Teacher.<br />Magister Volino, though not a Jesuit himself, had a love of Roman literature bordering on the sacred, and he inculcated it in his students—or tried to—with passion, flair and occasionally by hurling a blackboard eraser at recalcitrants. During my junior year we read the Roman historian Livy’s retelling of “Horatius at the Bridge”—an act of military bravery in the sixth century B.C."
