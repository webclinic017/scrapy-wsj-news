    "body": "Some evidence in the murder case of Adnan Syed, the Baltimore convict at the center of the first season of hit podcast “Serial,” will undergo additional forensic testing that wasn’t available at the time of his trial, prosecutors say.<br />Defense attorneys for Mr. Syed, who has spent more than 20 years in prison for the 1999 murder of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee, had approached Baltimore’s Sentencing Review Unit about a new review of the case after Maryland passed the Juvenile Restoration Act in April 2021. The act, among other things, allows people convicted of crimes as juveniles to request a modification of their sentence after they have served at least 20 years in prison, Ms. Mosby said."
