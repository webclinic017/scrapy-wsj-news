    "body": "John V. Roach was one of the more modest characters involved in the birth of the personal computer. As an executive of Tandy Corp., owner of the RadioShack store chain, he sometimes quipped, “We’re just simple country boys in the computer business.”<br />Even as Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were groping toward technological revolution in California, Mr. Roach and his colleagues in Fort Worth, Texas, were also trying to figure out how to make a small computer almost anyone could use."
