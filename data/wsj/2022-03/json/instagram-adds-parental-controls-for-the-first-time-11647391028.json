    "body": "Instagram on Wednesday started rolling out parental controls for its app for the first time. Parent company  Meta Platforms Inc .  will soon also let guardians supervise teens’ activity in virtual reality.<br />The first three Instagram parental-supervision tools—available Wednesday in the U.S.  before arriving globally in the coming months—will let parents see how much time their teens spend on Instagram and set limits. Parents can view what accounts their teens follow, as well as who follows them.  It also lets teens notify their parents when they report inappropriate behavior. The company plans eventually to make the tools available on its other platforms, such as Facebook."
