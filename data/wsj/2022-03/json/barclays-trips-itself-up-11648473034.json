    "body": "Barclays  shareholders woke on Monday to the unwelcome news of a sizable hit to its U.S. structured products business. These are generally cleverly-designed instruments—sometimes too cleverly for an unpredictable world—but the British bank was tripped up by a much more elementary error.<br />Structured products slice and dice debt, equities or other assets and can mix in some derivatives to offer buyers a narrowly-defined exposure. They have been known to explode spectacularly on occasion, usually when something happens that wasn’t built into their risk models. For example, French banks lost hundreds of millions of euros on their structured products when European bank dividends were banned at the start of the pandemic—a long-tail event not foreseen by their financial engineers. The collateralized debt obligations at the heart of the 2008 banking crisis were also a type of structured product built on what turned out to be faulty assumptions."
