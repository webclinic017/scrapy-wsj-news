    "body": "President Biden’s nomination of two progressive economists to key positions at the Federal Reserve has triggered accusations from conservatives and Republicans that the president is trying to politicize the Fed. But it’s too late; the central bank is already deeply politicized.<br />Congress mandates that the Federal Reserve promote price stability and full employment. Yet even as inflation rages, the Fed’s economists increasingly have been focused on issues such as climate change, race and sex discrimination, and economic inequality. Since 2020 the Fed’s regional banks and Board of Governors have conducted numerous seminars and conferences and published voluminous research papers on these politically charged topics."
