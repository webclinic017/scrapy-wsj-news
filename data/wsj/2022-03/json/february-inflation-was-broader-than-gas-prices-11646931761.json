    "body": "Inflation accelerated 7.9% in February, largely driven by an increase in energy prices, the Labor Department said Thursday. Gasoline rose 6.6% on the month and by itself contributed about a third of the overall monthly increase in consumer prices, the department said.<br />But energy wasnâ€™t the whole story. Other items such as groceries, plane tickets, rents and household appliances saw big price increases as well, in part driven by continued supply-chain difficulties, rising wages and, in the case of airline fares, higher fuel prices."
