    "body": "Against the odds, extreme market forces and political will are already redrawing the global energy-supply map as Europe looks to end its dependence on Russian gas.<br />On Friday, the U.S. committed to ship at least an additional 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas to Europe this year—implying a roughly two-thirds increase in exports to the region—and beyond that at least 50 bcm more annually until 2030. President Biden met European leaders in Brussels this week to discuss the war in Ukraine and how the U.S. could help the region wean itself off Russian energy."
