    "body": "The Russian government stands on the edge of defaulting on its sovereign debts for the first time since 1998, and international sanctions may complicate how creditors are compensated by nearly $6 billion of credit derivatives contracts if Russia fails to pay what they are owed.<br />Those derivative contracts, called credit default swaps, are meant to help investors insure they will receive near full compensation in case one of their underlying bonds defaults. There is approximately $4.5 billion of credit default swaps tied specifically to the Russian government, and an additional $1.5 billion located inside derivative indexes, according to  JPMorgan Chase  & Co."
