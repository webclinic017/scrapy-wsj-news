    "body": "POSTCARD PRINTS first made their mark on the fashion map after World War II, when after years on the home front, Americans began to travel—or at least dream of traveling. Sound familiar? Now that the world is once again opening up to tourism, prints compiling images of postcards are back, busily stoking wanderlust.<br />This season, miniature missives from destinations like Tokyo, London, Dubai, Milan and Hawaii plaster Balenciaga’s bodycon separates. Joseph Ribkoff’s capri pants and sleeveless shirt dresses superimpose images of vintage postcards on a tropical landscape, and Dolce & Gabbana’s new bag is a trompe l’oeil postcard, complete with a scrawled message that reads “Tanti Saluti!” (or “Best Regards!”)."
