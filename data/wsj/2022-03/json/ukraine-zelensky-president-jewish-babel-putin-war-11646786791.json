    "body": "In “Why Does Ukraine Have a Jewish President? Ask Isaac Babel” (op-ed, March 8), Ruth Wisse writes that “President Zelensky’s readiness to die for Ukraine’s freedom feels much like Babel’s refusal to curb his independence.” One must admit that this is a very attractive proposition and thesis. As a Ukrainian Jew, a hopeless romantic and an author of a book about Babel’s native Odessa, I find the answer that Ms. Wisse offers to be both great and also somewhat off.<br />With his indomitable and heroic performance as commander in chief over the past two weeks, Volodymyr Zelensky has set an immortal example. He has done more in two weeks to push back against the trope of the weakling Jew than Woody Allen has done in popularizing that trope over a half-century of filmmaking. (For the record, comrades: I love and grew up on Mr. Allen’s films.)"
