    "body": "Dirty, expensive to extract and trapped by a lack of pipelines, Canadian oil sands can be a tough investment proposition. Yet a year of elevated oil prices has turned companies mining them into cash machines.<br />Soaring energy prices are set to reward almost everyone producing hydrocarbons: Major oil companies and U.S. shale producers reported record free cash flows in 2021 and should do even better this year. Analysts polled by FactSet predict that a subindex of U.S. oil and gas exploration companies in the S&P 500 will beat last year’s bounty by an impressive 35%. Impressive, that is, until compared with Canadian oil sands producers:  Suncor Energy ,   Canadian Natural Resources ,   Imperial Oil  and  Cenovus  are set to increase their free cash flow by 60.5% this year, on average."
