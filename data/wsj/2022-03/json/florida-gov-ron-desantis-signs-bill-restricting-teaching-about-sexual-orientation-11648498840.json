    "body": "Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law a bill restricting teaching about sexual orientation and gender identity in public schools that has triggered divisive national debate.<br />Supporters of the legislation, passed earlier this month by the GOP-led legislature, say it is aimed at asserting more parental control over children’s education and prohibiting inappropriate classroom instruction. Opponents, including Democrats and civil-rights groups who call the measure the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, say it will censor discussion about lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and isolate LGBT children who are vulnerable to bullying."
