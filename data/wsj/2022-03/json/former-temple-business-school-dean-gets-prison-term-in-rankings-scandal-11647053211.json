    "body": "The former dean of Temple University’s business school was sentenced to more than a year in prison Friday, several months after he was convicted on fraud charges for his role in a scheme to bolster the school’s M.B.A. rankings with falsified data.<br />A U.S. district judge sentenced Moshe Porat, former dean of the Richard J. Fox School of Business and Management, to a 14-month term and ordered him to pay $250,000. In November, a jury found the 75-year-old Dr. Porat guilty on charges of conspiring to deceive donors and applicants, distorting data on students’ work experiences and standardized tests to bring in tuition dollars and gifts."
