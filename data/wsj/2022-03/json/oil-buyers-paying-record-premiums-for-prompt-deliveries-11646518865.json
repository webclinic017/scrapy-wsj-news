    "body": "Oil buyers have been paying the biggest premiums on record for barrels delivered now rather than later, signaling expectations that high fuel prices will reduce consumption and encourage drilling to replace Russia’s taboo crude.<br />Prices for April deliveries of crude have shot up since Russia invaded Ukraine and buyers began shunning the aggressor’s oil exports. The main U.S. price last week topped $110 a barrel for the first time in more than a decade."
