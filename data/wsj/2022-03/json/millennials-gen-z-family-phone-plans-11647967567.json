    "body": "Some adults are keeping their phone lines tethered to their parents as a way of cutting costs in the midst of surging inflation.<br />An October survey of 2,050 adults by personal finance site MagnifyMoney found that the parents of 39% of voting-age Gen Zers (which the survey defined as ages 18 to 24) and 12% of millennials (ages 25 to 40) pay their phone bills. Others fund their portion of the bill but prefer to retain the group discount by staying bundled."
