Doing so won’t be easy in the face of growing logistical, financial and legal hurdles.<br />Companies that have suspended sales to Russia include smartphone makers  Apple Inc.  and  Samsung Electronics Co. , PC manufacturers  HP Inc.  and  Dell Technologies Inc.,  and telecoms-gear provider  Ericsson  AB.
