    "body": "FRANKFURT—The European Central Bank said it would aim to phase out its large bond-buying program by September, sooner than expected, taking a key step toward raising interest rates to contain surging inflation despite the shock of war in Ukraine.<br />The ECB said in a statement that it would keep its key interest rates on hold but paved the way for increases before the end of the year. Any rate rises will take place “some time” after the end of the bank’s bond-buying program and will be gradual, the ECB said."
