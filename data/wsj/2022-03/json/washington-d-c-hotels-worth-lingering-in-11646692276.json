    "body": "WASHINGTON, D.C., is a garden for transients. It’s not surprising hotels also flourish in loam fertilized by power and politicking. DestinationDC, the city’s tourism bureau, expects 29 new properties to sprout in the next few years. For Washingtonians, many still mostly working from home, swanky lobbies and bars make a tempting neutral space to meet with friends and colleagues—a trend hoteliers are only too delighted to encourage. “The sign of a great hotel is when you see the locals come in and enjoy it,” said Joel Freyberg, managing director of the  DuPont  Circle hotel. Our goal is to make [it] an extension of the neighborhood.” Here are five lobbies where Washington feels right at home.<br />Not all properties languished during Covid. The Doyle Collection’s DuPont Circle hotel finished a $50 million makeover during the pandemic. Curvaceously embracing the eponymous landmark in a sleek midcentury white-brick wrapper, the 327-room property was a neighborhood staple attracting the free-popcorn, happy-hour crowd to its Bar DuPont."
