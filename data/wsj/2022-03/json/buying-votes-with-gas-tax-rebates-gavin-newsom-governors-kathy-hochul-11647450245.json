    "body": "State government coffers are swelling even as many Americans are feeling poorer amid surging inflation and gasoline prices. But instead of cutting taxes, some governors want to spend their surpluses buying political relief before the November election.<br />California Gov. Gavin Newsom last week said he planned to “put money back in the pockets of Californians to address rising gas prices” by sending checks to drivers—more details to come. The state’s gasoline prices are averaging $5.79 per gallon compared to $4.29 nationwide. Californians can blame hefty taxes and climate mandates."
