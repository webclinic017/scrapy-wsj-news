    "body": "To say that the king of nickel, Vladmir Potanin, is “Russia’s richest man” is to underestimate the rapacity of the Russian kleptocracy (“Russia Can Hold Nickel Hostage” by Allysia Finley, op-ed, March 15). Vladimir Putin, who can dip his paw into any cookie jar and extort tribute from a raft of oligarchs and a coterie of nervous satellite states, is generally billed not only as Russia’s richest man, but also the richest man on the planet, including Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Mr. Putin’s wealth has been estimated at nearly half a trillion dollars. Perhaps you should apologize to Mr. Putin for the erratum before he uses the slight as an excuse to invade the Journal’s offices.<br />Jeff Smith"
