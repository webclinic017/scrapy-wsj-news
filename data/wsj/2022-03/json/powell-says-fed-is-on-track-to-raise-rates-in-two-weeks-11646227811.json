    "body": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said it would be appropriate for the central bank to raise its benchmark interest rate at its meeting in two weeks amid high inflation, strong economic demand and a tight labor market.<br />Mr. Powell said it was too soon to tell how Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the strict economic curbs imposed by the West against Moscow would influence the U.S. economy. But his overall remarks suggested growing urgency to tighten policy."
