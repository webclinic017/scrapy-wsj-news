    "body": "The Pentagon says the plan to transfer MiGs was not “tenable.” In response, your editorial asks, “Untenable how?” (“NATO’S Polish MiG Fiasco,” March 10). Here’s how:<br />The 35-year-old Soviet aircraft will need a staging area, a quality fuel supply, Ukrainian-compatible communications, compatible ordinance hard mounts and supporting electronics, spares for battle damage and routine mechanical failures, forward air controllers, IFF (identify friend or foe) interrogation, electronic warfare to combat surface-to-air missiles, and a secure radar and GPS to get around and defeat jamming efforts. The Ukrainian pilots already qualified on the NATO Fulcrum MiG-29 will also need differences training, and then there’s the issue of friendly fire. A Ukrainian soldier, under intense stress, will shoot at any MiG-29 he sees."
