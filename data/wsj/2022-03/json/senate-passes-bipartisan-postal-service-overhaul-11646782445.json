    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Senate passed legislation designed to put the U.S. Postal Service on stronger financial footing and avoid a government bailout, including by repealing a requirement that it prefund retiree health benefits. The measure will next go to President Biden’s desk for his signature.<br />The bill passed the Senate 79-19 Tuesday, after easily clearing the House last month. The legislation is more than a decade in the making."
