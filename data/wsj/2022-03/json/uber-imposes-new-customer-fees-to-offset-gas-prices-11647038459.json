    "body": "Uber  Technologies Inc. is imposing a temporary surcharge on U.S. customers to soften the blow to drivers from mounting gas prices.<br />The fuel surcharge goes directly to drivers, the ride-sharing and food-delivery company said Friday. It ranges from 45 cents to 55 cents for Uber riders and 35 cents to 45 cents for Uber Eats customers. The charge will be in effect for the next two months."
