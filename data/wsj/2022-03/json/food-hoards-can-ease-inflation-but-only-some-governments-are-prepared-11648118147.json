    "body": "Food stockpiles might look comfortable at the global level. In reality, only a handful of governments have provisions to cope with grain shortages caused by the war in Ukraine.<br />For important cereals such as wheat and corn, the world-wide stock-to-use ratio—a measure of inventories as a proportion of annual demand—will finish the year at 29%, according to forecasts by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. This is lower than before the pandemic, although not worryingly so."
