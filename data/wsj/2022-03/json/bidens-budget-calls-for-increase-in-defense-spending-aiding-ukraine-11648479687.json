    "body": "WASHINGTON—President Biden on Monday released a $5.8 trillion budget calling for the largest-ever level of military spending and increased funding for law enforcement, playing down his proposals for expanding social programs in favor of backing initiatives generally favored by centrist lawmakers.<br />The budget also calls for higher taxes on businesses and the wealthiest Americans, part of an emphasis on reducing the federal deficit that departs from last year’s budget that laid out ambitious spending increases."
