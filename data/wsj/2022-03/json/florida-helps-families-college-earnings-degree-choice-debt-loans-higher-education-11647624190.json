    "body": "Naples, Fla.<br />College is looming. Our eldest son, a 10th-grader, is already thinking about which (actually, whether) college will help him become an entrepreneur. Our daughter, a ninth-grader, has already told us she wants a “return on investment” for whatever path she picks postgraduation. Then there are our twin boys, in seventh grade. Their high-school graduations may be five years off, but my wife and I already dread the college tuition tab for potentially all four kids at the same time."
