    "body": "Google the New York restaurant Pure Food & Wine and you’ll find photos of an uncommonly airy Midtown patio space; portraits of soaring, meatless food architecture; and a forbidding legend: “Permanently Closed.” How one of New York’s hotter foodie destinations got eighty-sixed is the subject of “Bad Vegan: Fame. Fraud. Fugitives,” though exactly why it all happened still may seem as cloudy as a quart of kombucha, even after the four episodes of director Chris Smith’s engrossing docuseries.<br />The enigmatic ingredient is Sarma Melngailis, who took Pure Food & Wine and its takeout offshoot, One Lucky Duck, to the top of the Manhattan food chain after she and celebrity chef Matthew Kenney opened their raw-food eatery in 2004 (with the financial backing of restaurant mogul Jeffrey Chodorow, a very sympathetic source in director Smith’s story). Veganism was hardly as ubiquitous as it is now, but after Mr. Kenney was eased out, Melngailis helped make the regimen hip and elitist—so much so that when the fugitive restaurateur and her criminal husband were later tracked down on the basis of a Domino’s pizza order, the headline writers were in heaven."
