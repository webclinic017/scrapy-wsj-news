    "body": "In a sign of these rancorously partisan times, the political right has drawn a target on the back of Sarah Bloom Raskin, President Biden’s superb nominee to become the Federal Reserve’s vice chairman for supervision. On Feb. 15 Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee blocked a vote on all five pending Fed nominees, but the clear target was Ms. Raskin. The next day, the Journal’s editorial board declared her “unfit for the Federal Reserve.”<br />I beg to differ. Ms. Raskin comes closer to being a perfect fit. Rejecting her nomination would be a terrible mistake for the Senate and a real loss to the Fed and the country. (Disclosure: Ms. Raskin is both a personal friend and a sometime professional colleague.)"
