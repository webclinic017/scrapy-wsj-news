    "body": "Kroger Co.  saw its sales and profit grow year over year in its latest quarter, with the supermarket company noting that costs have continued to climb for some categories of food that it sells.<br />Cincinnati-based Kroger said that identical sales, a metric that accounts for store openings and closings, grew 4% in the three months through January, excluding fuel sales. That continued a pandemic-era trend for the company, extending a period when consumers have been eating more meals at home. Identical sales were up 15% compared with two years ago, before the Covid-19 reached the U.S."
