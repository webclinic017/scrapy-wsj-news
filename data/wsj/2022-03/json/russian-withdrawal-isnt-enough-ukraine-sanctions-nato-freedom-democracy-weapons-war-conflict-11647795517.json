    "body": "In January 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt met Prime Minister Winston Churchill in Casablanca, Morocco. They agreed that the objective of the war was unconditional surrender. This week President Biden meets with leaders from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels. His objective in imposing sanctions on Russia was to deter an invasion of Ukraine. That failed. So what should Mr. Biden’s objective be now? The NATO meeting is the ideal setting to announce it.<br />Mr. Biden and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky have different objectives. Ukraine is fighting alone because NATO has refused it membership. It is understandable if Ukraine reaches terms whereby the Russians leave, while Ukraine accepts some sort of neutrality. Mr. Zelensky’s objective is to end the destruction of his country, while retaining its freedom."
