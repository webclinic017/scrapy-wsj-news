    "body": "Florida has many attractions and sound government policies. But maybe the rest of the country should be heard before it lets a Senator from the Sunshine State set the clocks for all 50 states.<br />The Sunshine Protection Act, which sailed through the Senate last week without debate, would set daylight-saving time as the year-round default starting in autumn 2023. Under current law clocks change twice each year, with daylight saving time beginning in March and ending in November. The Senate bill would end an 80-year tradition of seasonal clock switching. States could remain on standard time instead, but they would have to stick with it all year."
