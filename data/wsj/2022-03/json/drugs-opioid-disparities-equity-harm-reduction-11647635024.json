    "body": "“Opioid Overdoses Take Toll on Black People” (U.S. News, March 14) demonstrates that overdose rates are soaring nationwide and that disparities in the health and criminal-legal systems combined with the nation’s reluctant response to this crisis are disproportionately harming black people and other people of color. Our current drug policies are failing. We need a national response rooted in equity and public health.<br />Supporting and expanding access to harm-reduction programs will connect people who use drugs to critical care and support, thereby reducing overdose deaths and transmission of infectious diseases, while increasing connection to drug treatment. These studied and effective programs increase equity by serving people who don’t have ready access to healthcare and who have been disengaged from resources and support as a result of structural racism and overincarceration."
