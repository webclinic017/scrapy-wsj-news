    "body": "WARSAW—Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday threw her support behind efforts to investigate Russia for possible war crimes in Ukraine, saying the U.S. would work with international efforts already under way.<br />Ms. Harris, a former prosecutor, stopped short of calling Russia’s actions “war crimes,” while Polish President Andrzej Duda, speaking alongside her, did so twice. The Biden administration has strongly criticized Russia for invading Ukraine, but most top U.S. officials have reserved judgment publicly on whether Russia is deliberately targeting civilians or has broken international law."
