    "body": "WASHINGTON—Prosecutors rested their case Monday in the first Jan. 6 criminal trial, having put the son and a friend of a former Texas oil worker on the stand to show how he came to believe potentially violent means were needed to remove Washington lawmakers he deemed corrupt.<br />“Not making the sacrifice for this short time in your life could be detrimental for the rest of your life,” the man, Guy Reffitt, texted other members of a local right-wing group, as they discussed traveling to Washington to disrupt lawmakers’ planned certification of President Biden’s win in the 2020 election. Mr. Reffitt said he would drive so he could take guns and other gear, encouraging others to come with him, according to evidence presented by the prosecutors."
