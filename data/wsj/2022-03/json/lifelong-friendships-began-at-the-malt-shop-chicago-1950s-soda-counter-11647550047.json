    "body": "It was the quintessential teen malt shop of the 1950s, with soda fountain, green wooden booths, wall-hung mini jukeboxes and wall-to-wall teens. We called it Tom’s because that was the man’s name. We never noticed the neon sign in the window that said “Town Candy Shop.” I never knew anyone who bought the store-made chocolates. It was where we went for a dime Coke and to see and be seen.<br />Grey-haired Tom presided over the place in a silent, benevolent manner. It was up to his son, John—smiling, rotund John—to keep order: “No standing in the aisles.” “Sit or go!” “No dancing, you might step on the cat.”"
