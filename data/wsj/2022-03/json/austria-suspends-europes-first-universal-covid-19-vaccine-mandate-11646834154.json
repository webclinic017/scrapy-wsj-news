    "body": "The first country in Europe to adopt a universal Covid-19 vaccination mandate is backtracking, saying it will now suspend the measure based on findings showing that vaccines don’t protect well against infections by the Omicron variant.<br />Austria enacted the mandate last year but it has proven legally complex to design and officials fear it would face court challenges after coming into force later this month."
