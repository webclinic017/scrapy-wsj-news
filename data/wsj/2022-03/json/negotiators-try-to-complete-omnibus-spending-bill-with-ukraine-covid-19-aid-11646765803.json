    "body": "WASHINGTON—House Democratic leaders said they plan to hold a vote Wednesday on a measure to fund the federal government for the full fiscal year and provide further assistance to Ukraine, laying out a timeline for passing the spending bill even as some key issues have yet to be completed.<br />“We’re almost done. We’re going to vote tomorrow,” House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro (D., Conn.) told reporters Tuesday morning. She said that portions of the legislation, such as Covid-19 aid, were being worked on and that negotiators were still completing language. The current funding resolution runs out at 12:01 Saturday morning."
