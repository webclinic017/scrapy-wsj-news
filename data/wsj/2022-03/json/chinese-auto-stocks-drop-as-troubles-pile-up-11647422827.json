    "body": "Chinese auto stocks have skidded lower this year, as sluggish sales and supply-chain disruptions have made investors more pessimistic about the world’s largest car market.<br />The sector has been caught up in the broader volatility roiling Chinese markets, which have fallen sharply in recent sessions before clawing back some of those losses with a big rebound on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine has boosted prices for metals and oil, triggering concerns that manufacturers’ costs will surge and that demand for gas-guzzling larger vehicles will be dented."
