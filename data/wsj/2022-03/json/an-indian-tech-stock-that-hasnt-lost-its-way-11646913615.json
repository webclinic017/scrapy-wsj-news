    "body": "War, inflation, looming rate increases and a possible slowdown in global growth are rarely good news for stocks. India’s booming tech sector hasn’t been immune.<br />But there are some interesting exceptions. Shares of  Walmart -backed  CE Info Systems ,  a digital mapping company that works with  Apple  and  Amazon ,  are holding up well since the firm’s market debut in late 2021—despite an eye-popping price to sales ratio of over 50. Unlike many of its unicorn peers, the company is benefiting from direct regulatory tailwinds and is experiencing sustained profit growth."
