    "body": "Vladimir Putin’s attack on Ukraine is testing the health and strength of the American alliance system. In Europe and Asia, U.S. allies like Germany and Japan have rallied to defend an order that underwrites their security. In the Middle East, not so much.<br />When asked to increase energy production to help offset the consequences of sanctions on Russia, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told French President Emmanuel Macron that Saudi Arabia prefers to stick to its production agreements with Moscow. The United Arab Emirates, another longtime American ally in the doghouse with the Biden administration, has been similarly cool, abstaining from the United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Russia’s aggression before supporting a less consequential resolution in the General Assembly. Israel, which must coordinate its anti-Hezbollah and anti-Iran military activities in Syria with Russian military authorities and has deep ties to both Russia and Ukraine, seeks to avoid alienating either the U.S. or Russia as it navigates the chaotic interface between them."
