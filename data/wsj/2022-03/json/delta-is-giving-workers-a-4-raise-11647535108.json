    "body": "Delta Air Lines Inc .  is raising most employee wages 4% as demand for flights continues to rebound with the busy spring and summer travel season approaching.<br />Travelers are flocking back as corporate offices reopen and international restrictions are lifted, according to a memo sent Thursday to Delta employees from Ed Bastian, chief executive of the airline. That marks a shift from the start of the Covid-19 pandemic when revenue plunged 95%, marking “the most difficult and challenging time in the history of our company,” he said."
