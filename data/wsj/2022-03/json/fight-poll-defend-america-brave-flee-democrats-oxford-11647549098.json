    "body": "Regarding Matthew Hennessey’s op-ed “Home of the Brave, RIP” (March 11): I am a Vietnam vet and a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy. I didn’t learn the wokeness, cancel culture and critical race theory that has been promoted in so many schools. I was taught that socialism and communism were bad, bad for us as individuals. But so many students at other schools were taught with an exclusive focus on the horrors of U.S. history. They were taught that equity is so much better than equal opportunity. They’ve been listening to their professors and the mainstream media for so long that they don’t know how to think any other way.<br />If I got a do-over, I would serve my country again and proudly. But if I were brought up in a liberal university, I probably wouldn’t serve my country either, much less fight for it."
