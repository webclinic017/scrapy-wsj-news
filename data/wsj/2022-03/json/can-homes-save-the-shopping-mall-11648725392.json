    "body": "Westfield’s owner has given investors a preview of what shopping malls might look like in the future—part ad platform, part housing complex. But the makeover plan is just window dressing until it can sell its American properties for funding.<br />Europe’s top listed commercial property company in terms of gross assets,  Unibail Rodamco Westfield ,  said at an investor day Wednesday that it will make a bigger push into residential property development and advertising. Unibail’s share price is more than one-third below its prepandemic level, weaker than its major European and U.S. mall competitors. The stock is also down more than 60% since Unibail’s purchase of Westfield in 2018—an expensive deal the mall owner is now trying to reverse through sales of its U.S. properties. Heavy debt, equivalent to 16 times earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization, is the main reason why many investors consider its stock too risky."
