    "body": "As economic and banking sanctions against Russia proliferate, many investors and creditors are asking what will happen with Russian sovereign debt, which the Russian Federation has issued through both foreign-currency bonds and ruble bonds. If history is a guide, nothing good awaits foreign lenders.<br />As economic sanctions have isolated the Putin regime, Russia, to conserve its financial reserves, has prohibited debt payments to foreigners in hard currency. Doubling down, Vladimir Putin recently decreed that Russian entities may satisfy their obligations to residents of “countries that engage in hostile activities”—like the U.S., members of the European Union and others—by paying rubles priced at an artificially high exchange rate set by the Central Bank of Russia. If that declaration alone doesn’t constitute default, a hard default seems imminent."
