    "body": "Early in the morning of March 13, 1964, a young woman named Kitty Genovese was stabbed to death near her apartment building in New York’s borough of Queens. Although early reporting exaggerated the number of people who heard her screams and minimized their response, the episode became a parable of bystander inaction in the face of deadly assault.<br />I was a college freshman when this event occurred, but it has stuck with me ever since because it raises such profound questions about our responsibility to protect others from harm."
