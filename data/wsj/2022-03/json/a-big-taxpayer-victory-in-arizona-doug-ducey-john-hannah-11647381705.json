    "body": "Arizonans who fled California for sunnier tax climes can breathe easier after a court ruling that has saved the day from a punitive 8% top state tax rate.<br />A state judge on Friday struck down Arizonaâ€™s Proposition 208, which placed a 3.5% surtax on incomes above $250,000, or $500,000 for joint filers. The surtax passed narrowly in a 2020 referendum that sought to raise hundreds of millions of dollars for public schools. But the surtax would also have blown past the cap on education spending in the state constitution."
