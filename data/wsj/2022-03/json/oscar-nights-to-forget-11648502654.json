    "body": "In the aftermath of an ugly spectacle on Sunday night, the members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences may be tempted to count this year’s Oscar awards ceremony as their most embarrassing yet. But there is plenty of competition in this category, even if it’s not an honor just to be nominated.<br />Some may immediately think of the time in 2017 when presenters announced the wrong movie as the winner of the best picture award, but with the passage of time the smoother presentation of Oscars night in 2007 is looking harder to defend."
