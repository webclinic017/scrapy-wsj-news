    "body": "A recreational runner and cyclist, Jeff Abernathy nearly abandoned his athletic aspirations in 2014 when he was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, an autoimmune condition that affects the joints. A virtual bike-racing league now has him training like a pro cyclist.<br />After a year of inactivity, he set a goal to run 1 mile or bike 5 miles every day. To keep up his cycling in the winter months, he started riding a stationary bike, streaming workouts via Zwift, an app where indoor cyclists can ride and race together in a live, videogame-like universe. Riders often cycle on virtual versions of real racecourses, like the Tour de France."
