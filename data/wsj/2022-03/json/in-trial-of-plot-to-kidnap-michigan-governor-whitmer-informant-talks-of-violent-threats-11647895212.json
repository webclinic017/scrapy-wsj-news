    "body": "Violent threats, beer- and marijuana-fueled encounters, training with high-powered weaponry and clandestine surveillance all figured into testimony from a key government informant Monday in the trial of four men accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.<br />Dan Chappel, a 35-year-old combat veteran turned government informant, testified that he joined a group called the Wolverine Watchmen in March 2020 as a way to keep up his military training. But he said he quickly grew alarmed by threats to law-enforcement made by members of the group in a private online forum, so he called a friend who is a police officer."
