    "body": "Shame on me. I was so excited to see a performance of “Prayer for the French Republic” at New York City Center with a group of girlfriends that I never checked the theater’s website for its Covid policies. Had I looked, I would have known that there was still a mask mandate in place, and I wouldn’t have bought a ticket.<br />I arrived at the theater five minutes before the curtain went up and was asked to put on my mask. I didn’t have one. I threw my masks away the minute the New York City mandates were lifted, but the helpful door attendant was happy to hand me one."
