    "body": "A  China Eastern Airlines Corp .  plane carrying more than 130 passengers and crew crashed into the mountains of southern China on Monday afternoon, setting off a global race to understand what caused the seven-year-old plane to fall from the sky.<br />We don’t know yet why China Eastern flight 5735 crashed, and it could be some time before we do—crash investigations often take months or years. Investigators usually try to find and analyze the plane’s flight-data recorder and cockpit voice recorder  to help gain insights into a flight’s final moments. Typically when a  Boeing Co.  plane crashes abroad, the National Transportation Safety Board is invited to participate as a U.S. representative and the Federal Aviation Administration provides technical support, along with technical assistance from Boeing and the engine supplier."
