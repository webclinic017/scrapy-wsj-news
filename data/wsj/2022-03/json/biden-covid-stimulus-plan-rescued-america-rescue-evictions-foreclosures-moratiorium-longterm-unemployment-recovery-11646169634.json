    "body": "The painful truth about economic recoveries is that not everyone bounces back financially after a downturn. Persistent or even permanent economic problems—such as long-term unemployment, weak labor markets for inexperienced workers, evictions and foreclosures—trap too many Americans in difficult economic situations. But there are policies that can limit this “scarring,” as economists sometimes refer to it, and President Biden’s American Rescue Plan has led to less of it than any recovery in at least the past 50 years.<br />Consider long-term unemployment. While most jobs will return after an economic downturn, the number of people struggling with long-term unemployment—without work for at least six months—often remains relatively high for months after general unemployment peaks. Long-term unemployment persisted for years after the double-dip recession of the early 1980s and well past when President Reagan started running his “Morning in America” ads in 1984. While the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 helped avert an economic depression, the persistence of high long-term unemployment two years later led President Obama to press a Republican House (unsuccessfully) for a second stimulus bill."
