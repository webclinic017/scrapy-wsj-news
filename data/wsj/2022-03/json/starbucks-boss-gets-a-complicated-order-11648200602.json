    "body": "Howard Schultz says he’s just popping into  Starbucks  for a cup of coffee this time. The man who ably guided the chain from 1987 to 2000, and then returned in 2008 for a nine-year encore, will become interim chief executive on April 4 as the company searches for a permanent successor to CEO Kevin Johnson.<br />He’s returning at a challenging time. Starbucks’ shares are down by 31% since peaking last summer as unionization pressure and inflation dog the company. The company says it will pay U.S. staff an average of $17 an hour by this summer."
