    "body": "WASHINGTON—Congressional negotiators were rushing to complete the text of legislation funding the government beyond Friday, with the Biden administration’s request for $10 billion in aid to Ukraine adding to pressure to meet a looming deadline.<br />Republicans and Democrats, after taking months to agree on total defense and nondefense fiscal 2022 spending, have been held up by topics as varied as tacking on emergency money for Ukraine and the next phase of the coronavirus outbreak. With the interim law funding the government expiring at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, and House Democrats set to be in Philadelphia starting Wednesday for a long-planned retreat, negotiators need to make progress quickly."
