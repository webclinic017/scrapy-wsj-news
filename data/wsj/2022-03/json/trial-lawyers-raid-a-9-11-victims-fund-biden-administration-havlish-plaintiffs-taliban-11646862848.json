    "body": "The fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban marked a second torment for 9/11 victims, but one consolation is that they  have a legal path to claim significant additional damages. Or at least they might have had one if not for a White House order last month that excludes all but a few from receiving a payout.<br />In February, in a move that seemed out of the blue, President Biden signed an executive order to divide some $7 billion in seized Afghan assets. The order says half should go to humanitarian aid for Afghans, and the other half for the Taliban’s U.S. victims. The big surprise is that the order took a narrow view of which victims are worthy. Rather than make $3.5 billion available to the thousands of terror victims throughout the U.S., the President’s plan will direct most of it to about 150 people."
