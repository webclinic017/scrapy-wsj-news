    "body": "Vladimir Putin continues to escalate his bloody war in Ukraine, and he’s testing NATO more every day. The Russian is exploiting President Biden’s publicly stated declarations of what the U.S. won’t do to help Ukraine, and in the process he is bringing the war closer to NATO’s borders.<br />That’s the significance of Sunday’s bombing of a Ukrainian military training site a mere 10 miles from the Polish border. The strike killed 35 and injured more than 130. Until last month, U.S. National Guard soldiers had trained Ukrainians at the site."
