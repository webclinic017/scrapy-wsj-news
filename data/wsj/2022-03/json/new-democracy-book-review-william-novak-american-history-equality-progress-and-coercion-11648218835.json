    "body": "After the election of 2016, the word “democracy” was suddenly everywhere. The ascension of Donald Trump was an “assault” or an “attack” or a “war” on democracy. Commentators on the left, and a few on the right, spoke constantly about “our democracy” being “imperiled” or “in the balance” or some such. The catalogs of major book publishers were awash with titles like “How Democracies Die” and “Democracy in Chains,” and the Washington Post gave itself the strange slogan “Democracy dies in darkness.”<br />It was all disorienting to Americans—the great majority, I suspect—who understand the word in its ordinary procedural sense. Democracy, in this planer sense, is about fair elections, rules-based campaigns, policy making by the winners of those elections, and constitutional limits on their power. But when modern progressives use the word, as William J. Novak makes clear in “New Democracy: The Creation of the Modern American State,” they mean something else entirely."
