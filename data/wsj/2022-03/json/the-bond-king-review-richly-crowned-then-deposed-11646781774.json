    "body": "‘The Bond King” titillates with its subtitle: “How One Man Made a Market, Built an Empire, and Lost It All.” But Wall Street has a slightly different recollection of Bill Gross, co-founder, in 1971, of Pimco, the giant California money management firm. Closer to the plain truth might be: “How One Man Reimagined a Market, Built a Business, Got Rich, and Stayed Rich.” Mr. Gross, 77, was the chief investment brain, public voice and institutional face of Pimco until his exasperated partners gave him the gate in 2014.<br />In Mary Childs’s entertaining pages, the bond market shares the spotlight with Mr. Gross, as well as with his fans and, especially, his detractors. Bonds were always an important branch of finance. Only in the past half-century did they become a colorful one."
