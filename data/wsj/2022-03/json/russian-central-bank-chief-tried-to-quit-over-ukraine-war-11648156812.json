    "body": "Russian Central Bank Gov. Elvira Nabiullina tried to resign after the invasion of Ukraine, people familiar with the matter said. Her effort was rejected by Russian President Vladimir Putin who instead nominated her for a third term.<br />Over nearly a decade Ms. Nabiullina has been one of Mr. Putinâ€™s most stalwart allies in buttressing the Russian economy against volatile oil prices and U.S. sanctions in a growing face-off with the West, while remaining one of the few liberals who hold senior positions in the Russian government."
