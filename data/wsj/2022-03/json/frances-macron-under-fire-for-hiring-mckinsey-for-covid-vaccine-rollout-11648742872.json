    "body": "PARIS—Scrutiny of the French government’s spending on private consultants during the vaccine rollout has thrown President Emmanuel Macron on the defensive as his bid for re-election approaches its final week.<br />The French Senate released a report earlier this month detailing how the government spent €893.9 million, equivalent to $993 million, last year on consultants, including McKinsey & Co., to help French officials navigate the pandemic and other challenges. That was a sizable increase on the €379.1 million spent in 2018, Mr. Macron’s first full year in power, the report said."
