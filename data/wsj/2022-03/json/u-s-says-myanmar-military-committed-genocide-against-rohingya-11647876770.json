    "body": "The Biden administration has concluded that the Myanmar military’s violence against the Rohingya minority amounts to genocide, a rare designation that comes around five years after the military’s campaign of mass killings, rape and arson attacks drove hundreds of thousands of Rohingya to flee their homeland.<br />Secretary of State Antony Blinken said attacks against the Rohingya in 2016 and 2017 were widespread and systematic and that there was a clear intent to destroy the Rohingya community. The finding marks the eighth time since the Holocaust that the U.S. has determined that genocide was committed."
