    "body": "<br />Bassist Michael Formanek and drummer Tomas Fujiwara share the stage in one of the most prolific and respected new groups in jazz, Thumbscrew, a collective trio with guitarist Mary Halvorson. The band, which played its first gig in March 2012, is emblematic of jazz for the past 10 years. Its members are equally adept at honoring the tradition, adding to the canon, and showcasing originals; each aspect of their work features extraordinary rapport. It’s as if the listener is eavesdropping on an insightful conversation among three old friends."
