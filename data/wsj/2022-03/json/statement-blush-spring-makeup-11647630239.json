    "body": "THE LATE FASHION EDITOR Diana Vreeland was rarely seen without her signature Kabuki-like blush. She’d apply the bright pink pigment across the cheeks and up to her ears with a flourish so exaggerated (as was her way with a great many things) that, according to fashion lore, a flight attendant once leaned down to say: “Here, honey, let me rub in your rouge for you.”<br />The longstanding belief that naturally flushed cheeks indicate good health might explain blush’s resurgence in the midst of a pandemic. Models in varying incarnations of Vreeland’s favorite makeup appeared on many spring runways, including those of Anna Sui, Altuzarra and Viktor & Rolf. New York makeup artist Suzy Gerstein contends that bright blush applied broadly across the cheeks can connote well-being (hence the phrase “in the pink”), while a more austere placement high on the cheeks reads as ladylike. Blush can emphasize or enhance bone structure and even fake a lifting effect. “It’s the underdog of products but one of the most important because it can change the shape of the face,” said Los Angeles makeup artist Jamie Greenberg."
