    "body": "Will Ukraine become another Afghanistan? The most likely scenario appears to be a Russian takeover of the country’s major cities and the installation of a puppet government in Kyiv. Ukrainian resistance would then evolve into an enduring insurgency led by political leadership based abroad and backed by the U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.<br />The West’s expectation seems to be that over time the costs of protracted conflict, along with economic and political isolation imposed by the U.S. and its allies, will exhaust Russia and lead to its withdrawal from Ukraine and possibly to political change in Moscow. Many believe that Vladimir Putin’s overthrow is necessary for the restoration of Ukraine’s sovereignty."
