    "body": "Lawmakers reached a deal to reauthorize a program allowing foreign investors to apply for green cards after investing in U.S. real estate or other projects, after the program lapsed for the first time last year over a push to make its criteria stricter.<br />The EB-5 visa program, which has raised more than $40 billion for U.S. real-estate projects and other enterprises and funded major developments like New York Cityâ€™s Hudson Yards, went out of business last July when a key congressional authorization for the program expired."
