    "body": "Ralph Nader spent a career bashing corporate executives. Now he’s written a book praising some. It’s not going down too well.<br />Tentatively called “Twelve CEOs I Have Known and Admired,” the book is more than a little off-brand for the man who upended the world of auto safety with the blockbuster “Unsafe at Any Speed” and then attacked corporate behavior in a number of other industries."
