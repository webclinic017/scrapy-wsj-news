    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Gensler Stages a Climate Coup” (March 22): Let’s save time and money and simply require every company to include the following language in its 10-K: “It might get hotter in the future, it might get colder, or it might stay about the same. Public companies have almost no ability to affect the global climate. Our company’s greatest climate risk is costly regulation, and this risk is significantly enhanced when progressives are in charge.”<br />Dana R. Hermanson"
