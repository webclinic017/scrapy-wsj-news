    "body": "“Credit Firms Strip Most Medical Debt” (U.S. News, March 19) doesn’t address the impact that uncollected debts have on the medical system. When patients fail to pay for the care they receive, prices naturally rise in subsequent years for all patients to offset these losses.<br />When a plumber installs a water heater, he submits a bill for parts and labor and expects to be paid the full amount. When doctors and hospitals submit bills for care provided, they are contractually paid pennies on the dollar by the insurer. Patients who fail to fully pay their residual portion of those bills force the absorption of these costs elsewhere in the medical system."
