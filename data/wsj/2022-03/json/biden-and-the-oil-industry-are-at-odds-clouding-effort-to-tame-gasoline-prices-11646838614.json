    "body": "A tense relationship between the Biden administration and the oil industry is clouding the prospects for a unified response to the growing threat of energy shortages and surging gasoline prices in the wake of the crisis in Ukraine.<br />President Biden stoked the tensions on Tuesday while announcing a U.S. ban on Russian oil imports, designed to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine and bombing civilians. In a televised address, Mr. Biden asked the nation to brace for higher gas prices, which hit a national average of $4.252 a gallon on Wednesday."
