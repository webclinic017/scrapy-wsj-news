    "body": "Russia insists its invasion of Ukraine is only a “special military operation,” and journalists in the country who say otherwise could face 15 years in prison. This totalitarian control of language is meant to intimidate Russians and the media, foreign and domestic, and it appears to have infected the United Nations.<br />“In an email to a staff mailing list on Monday with the subject line ‘Ukraine crisis communications guidelines’, the director of the United Nations Regional Information Centre instructed employees not to describe the situation as a war and not to add the Ukrainian flag to personal or official social media accounts or websites,” the Irish Times reported Tuesday. The publication says U.N. staff were instructed to say “conflict” or “military offensive” when describing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and that the policy is meant to avoid “reputational risk.”"
