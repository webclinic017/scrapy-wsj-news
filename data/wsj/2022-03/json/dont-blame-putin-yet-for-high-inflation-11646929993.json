    "body": "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine makes the February inflation report feel like old news. Still, the numbers were something to behold.<br />The Labor Department on Thursday said that overall consumer prices rose a seasonally adjusted 0.8% last month from January, putting them 7.9% above their year-earlier level. That was the biggest increase since January 1982. Core prices, which exclude food and energy items in an attempt to better capture inflation’s trend, were up 6.5% versus a year earlier, for the biggest gain since August 1982."
