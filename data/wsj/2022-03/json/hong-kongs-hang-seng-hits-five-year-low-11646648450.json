    "body": "Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 3.9% Monday to close at its lowest since July 2016, as an international selloff fueled by the war in Ukraine put fresh pressure on a market already suffering from Beijing’s corporate crackdowns and tough local pandemic policies.<br />Some key stock indexes in mainland China also fell to their lowest levels in more than a year, after a weekend meeting of China’s legislature failed to ease investor concerns about the regulatory outlook for the country’s beleaguered technology and property sectors."
