    "body": "Europe’s fast-growing food apps can add inflation to their list of problems. But changes in consumer eating patterns caused by the pandemic are sticking so far and valuations seem undercooked.<br />Demand for takeout meals remained strong in the three months through December, recent results have shown. Berlin-based  Delivery Hero  said its sales rose 66% compared with the same period of 2020.  HelloFresh ,  which delivers boxed meal kits that consumers cook up at home, increased sales by more than one-third. Grubhub’s Dutch owner Just Eat Takeaway.com (JET) grew by 14%, which was less than investors had hoped."
