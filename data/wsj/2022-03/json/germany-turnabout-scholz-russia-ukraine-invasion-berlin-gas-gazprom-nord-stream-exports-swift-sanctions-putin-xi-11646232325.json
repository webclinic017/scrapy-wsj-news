    "body": "Vladimir Putin must feel like a lapdog who is suddenly banished from the couch to the basement. Since 2008, when he set out to restore the Soviet empire, he has piled up territory at little risk and cost. He subdued Georgia, grabbed Crimea, pushed into the Middle East, and sliced off Ukraine’s southeast. All the while, the West refused to raise the price. It slapped him with mild penalties while preaching the virtues of diplomacy. Presidents Obama and Trump actually pulled troops from Europe.<br />Now, after the lunge into Ukraine, the biggest surprise is Russia’s loss of Germany, for decades a most reliable partner. Suddenly, the country at the fulcrum of the European balance has stopped seesawing, plunked down in the West, and traded striped pants for fatigues. The country is promising to rearm. It has imposed nasty sanctions on Russia and is at last letting weapons get to Ukraine."
