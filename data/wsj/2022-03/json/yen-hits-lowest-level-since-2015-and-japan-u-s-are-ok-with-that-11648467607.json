    "body": "TOKYO—The dollar rose to a more than six-year high against the yen Monday, fueled by Japan’s preference for a weaker currency and—in a shift—tacit acceptance from U.S. officials focused on inflation.<br />For the first time since August 2015, a dollar on Monday briefly bought more than 125 yen on foreign-exchange markets, compared with around 110 yen a half-year ago. The dollar was changing hands at around 123.93 yen late Monday in Tokyo."
