    "body": "‘We have been having inflation,” Milton Friedman observed in 1978, “not because evil men at the Fed have been willfully turning the printing press, but because John Q. Public has been demanding inflation and aborting every attempt to stop inflation. We, the public, have been asking Congress to provide us with ever more goodies—yet not to raise our taxes.”<br />How do you square this with his more famous pronouncement, “Inflation is everywhere and always a monetary phenomenon”? Friedman’s answer: “Financing government spending by increasing the quantity of money is often the most politically attractive method to both presidents and members of Congress.”"
