    "body": "Russia’s assault on Ukraine triggered a surge of calls for Western allies to completely sever Russia from the global financial system by disconnecting it from the Swift global financial messaging system.<br />The European Union was set Tuesday to instruct the Swift financial network to delist seven banks, including Russia’s VTB Bank, Bank Rossiya and Bank Otkritie, according to several diplomats involved in discussions. The measure should be approved Tuesday evening although discussions were ongoing on whether any more banks should be immediately delisted."
