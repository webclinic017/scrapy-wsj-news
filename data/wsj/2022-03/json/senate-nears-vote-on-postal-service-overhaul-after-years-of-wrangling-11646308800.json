    "body": "WASHINGTON—Less than two years ago, the U.S. Postal Service was embroiled in a political battle between then-President Donald Trump, who called the agency a joke and whose administration had proposed privatizing it, and Democrats who accused him and the postmaster general of trying to sabotage mail-in voting during the 2020 election.<br />Now, legislation aimed at helping the service become more financially viable has passed the House by an overwhelming majority and is on the verge of clearing the Senate as soon as Thursday. The reversal of fortune would represent another bipartisan breakthrough after last year’s roughly $1 trillion infrastructure law."
