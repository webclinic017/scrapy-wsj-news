    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court considered Monday whether airline baggage handlers can be compelled to resolve employment disputes through individual private arbitration, a case that could also help determine whether drivers for ride-share companies such as  Lyft  and  Uber  fall under the arbitration umbrella.<br />The Supreme Court’s conservative majority has previously read a 1925 statute, the Federal Arbitration Act, to bind employees and consumers to individual private arbitration when employers and retailers place legal clauses in form contracts, even when state laws or other federal statutes suggest they could bring class actions or file lawsuits to resolve disputes."
