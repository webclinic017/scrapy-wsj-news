    "body": "Edgar Allan Poe called her “a woman of fine genius and”—pardon the sexism—“masculine energy and ability.” He was referring to Sarah Josepha Hale, his editor at Godey’s Lady’s Book, the most widely read magazine of the antebellum era. A celebrity in her own day, Hale is largely forgotten in ours.<br />Sarah Hale was one of the most influential women in American history, playing an essential role in shaping the way Americans in the 19th century thought about women and their place in society. Two decades before the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention on women’s rights, she was editorializing about women’s rights to an education, to work and to manage their own money. She—not Mother Goose—was the author of one of the most famous verses in English, “Mary Had a Little Lamb.” Our modern-day Thanksgiving holiday wouldn’t exist without Hale, who reimagined it as a shared national celebration rather than a series of disparate local events named by governors."
