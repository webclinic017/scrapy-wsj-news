    "body": "The Ukrainian people are making great sacrifices fighting against Russia’s war machine, and their resistance is helping the free world. As NATO’s leaders meet this week in Brussels, now is the time for the alliance to repay this fortitude by escalating support for Kyiv.<br />“Ukrainian forces have defeated the initial Russian campaign of this war. That campaign aimed to conduct airborne and mechanized operations to seize Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, and other major Ukrainian cities to force a change of government in Ukraine,” concludes the Washington-based Institute for the Study War (ISW) in a Saturday analysis. “Russian forces continue to make limited advances in some parts of the theater but are very unlikely to be able to seize their objectives in this way.”"
