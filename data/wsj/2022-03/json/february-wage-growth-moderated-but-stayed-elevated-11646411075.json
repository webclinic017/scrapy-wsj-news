    "body": "U.S. wage growth slowed slightly in February but remained near historically high levels, adding to inflationary pressures when consumer prices were also rising rapidly.<br />Private-sector average hourly earnings rose a seasonally adjusted 5.1% in February from the previous year, cooler than the 5.5% gain in January, the Labor Department said Friday. Four of the past five months have seen annual wage gains exceed 5%. By contrast, wages rose an average of 3.2% a year in the two years to February 2020, before the Covid-19 pandemic hit the U.S. economy."
