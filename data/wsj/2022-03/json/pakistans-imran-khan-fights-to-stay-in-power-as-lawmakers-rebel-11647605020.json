    "body": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan—Imran Khan is fighting to hold on to power in Pakistan after a group of lawmakers from his party rebelled and allied parties in his ruling coalition said they were considering ditching him.<br />The votes are increasingly stacking up against the former cricketing star, whose governing coalition has a thin majority in parliament. A vote that will decide whether he keeps his post is expected later this month. His party is vowing to fight “to the last ball,” using a cricketing analogy."
