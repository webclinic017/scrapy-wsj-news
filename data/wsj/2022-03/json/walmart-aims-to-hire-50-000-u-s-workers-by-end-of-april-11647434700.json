    "body": "Walmart Inc.  wants to hire tens of thousands of workers by the end of April as the country’s largest private employer pushes to expand its retail and other businesses in the midst of a tight labor market.<br />The retail chain is seeking around 50,000 workers in the U.S. in the current quarter, the company said, at a time of year when many retailers pull back on hiring following the holiday shopping season. Many of those workers will fill store roles, but Walmart also aims to add staff in new business areas such as health and wellness and advertising, said Donna Morris, the company’s chief people officer."
