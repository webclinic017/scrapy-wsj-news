    "body": "A  Starbucks Corp.  store in Seattle voted to unionize Tuesday, the first in the coffee chain’s hometown to seek representation from a growing union of chain baristas.<br />Chain workers at a single Seattle location voted 9-0 to be represented by the Starbucks Workers United union. Starbucks had petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to review that vote’s structure ahead of Tuesday’s tally. The federal labor agency denied the appeal, as it has done in response to   other review requests by the company so far."
