    "body": "The Federal Open Market Committee meets Tuesday and Wednesday, as it seeks to address the worst inflation in 40 years amid new risks to economic growth. Whatever the Fed decides on interest rates, it’s worth recalling how the central bank arrived at this unhappy moment.<br />The first reality to confront is that this is a mess largely of the Fed’s own making. The central bank’s inflation target is 2% for personal-consumption expenditure inflation, and the rate in February was probably three times higher. The Consumer-price index is higher still."
