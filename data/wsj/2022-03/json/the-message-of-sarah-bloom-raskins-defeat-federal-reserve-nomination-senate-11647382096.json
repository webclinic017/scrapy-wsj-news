    "body": "Sarah Bloom Raskin on Tuesday withdrew her nomination for vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, and the message of her defeat is more important than the fate of one would-be regulator. Her defeat is a warning to the Fed that a majority of the Senate doesn’t believe the central bank should use its power to allocate capital for political purposes.<br />President Biden blamed Ms. Raskin’s defeat on “baseless attacks from industry and conservative interest groups.” But Ms. Raskin’s most significant opponent was her oft-expressed view that the Fed and other regulators should deny credit to companies that produce or heavily consume fossil fuels. We’ve documented those views in several editorials."
