    "body": "Sony  clearly isn’t ready to follow arch-rival  Microsoft  all the way into new forms of videogame distribution. It can afford not to—for now.<br />The maker of the popular PlayStation consoles announced new subscription-based services on Tuesday. The company is effectively adding two new tiers to its existing PlayStation Plus service and doing away with PlayStation Now, a cloud gaming service launched in 2014. That capability is now rolled into the highest tier of the new offerings, which competes with the highest tier of Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass service."
