    "body": "‘The Thing About Pam,” starring Renée Zellweger, is a chronicle of a real murder case—a crime committed by a woman, Pamela Hupp, who had long presented herself as a pillar of her community, a small town in Missouri. There, on Dec. 27, 2011, a woman by the name of Betsy Faria was found dead in the den of her house. A cancer patient, she had just had her chemotherapy treatment. Her husband, Russell, discovered her body, which showed she had been stabbed 55 times. That grieving husband, not surprisingly, became suspect No. 1, and would ultimately be charged with and convicted of his wife’s murder—a conviction that would eventually be reversed. Upon further inspection, Pamela Hupp’s behavior—the way she testified in court with lies and evasions, to name just a few giveaway signs—raised suspicions.<br />Ms. Zellweger, who does justice to the role, transmits a powerful aura of derangement, and does so with enough energy to make you want to reach for the antacid pills. The one flaw in the tone of the six-part work is its pervasive note of archness, ever so slight but also ever so always there. A note common in many a crime docu-drama. Its purpose, generally, is to keep things reassuringly intimate, and above the fray."
