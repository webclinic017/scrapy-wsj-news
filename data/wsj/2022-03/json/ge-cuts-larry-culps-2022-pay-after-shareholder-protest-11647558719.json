    "body": "General Electric Co. said Chief Executive Larry Culp agreed to reduce his potential compensation by about $10 million this year, responding to shareholder concerns over changes that  GE ’s  board made to executives’ pay packages in 2020.<br />In August 2020, the GE board revised Mr. Culp’s contract, extending it until 2024 and awarding him a special stock grant during the year that was valued at more than $100 million by the end of 2020. Asset managers called the awards poorly linked to the company’s performance, which they characterized as trailing that of GE’s peers."
