    "body": "The U.S. bankruptcy system is facing a backlash from all three branches of the federal government as big companies and wealthy individuals push the limits of chapter 11 to relieve themselves of legal and financial liabilities.<br />Bankruptcy courts aim to facilitate corporate reorganizations that will save businesses and jobs. But some are going beyond their core mandate of rehabilitating companies and are functioning to help moneyed organizations and individuals pay as little as possible to people hurt by allegedly defective products or corporate wrongdoing, prompting a reaction from government authorities, according to a number of participants in the bankruptcy system."
