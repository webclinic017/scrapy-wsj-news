    "body": "China lacks the rule of law, but that doesn’t stop Chinese companies from taking advantage of the U.S. legal system. A California bankruptcy court judge last week approved a settlement agreement between the state-owned Aviation Industry Corp. of China, or AVIC, its subsidiaries and two American entities and their co-claimants. After years of litigation and under some duress, the Americans agreed to walk away with less than a third of the more than $85 million they were owed under an arbitrator’s judgment.<br />The story begins in 2008, when AVIC International USA, one of many AVIC subsidiaries, teamed up with Texas entrepreneur Patrick Jenevein, his company Tang Energy Group, and a handful of other American investors. Under a joint venture known as Soaring Wind, they agreed to work together on wind energy. But the relationship soured. Tang said it learned that AVIC USA’s sister subsidiaries were competing against Soaring Wind."
