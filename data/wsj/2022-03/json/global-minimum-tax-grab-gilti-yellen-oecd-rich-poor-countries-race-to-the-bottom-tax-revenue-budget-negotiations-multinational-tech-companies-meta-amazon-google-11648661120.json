    "body": "World leaders announced a new global corporate minimum tax to great fanfare last year. On March 14 the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released guidance on how to implement it. The contorted language of the guidance, as well as political foot-dragging in several countries, makes clear that the ballyhooed global tax plan would be a great and expensive flop. Better to let this hydra-headed monster die.<br />The agreement was always a tax grab. Leaving aside rhetoric about helping poor countries and ensuring fairness, Europe wanted to raise revenue by taxing U.S. companies. The Biden administration has cheered the agreement along with familiar claims that big companies should “pay their fair share.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellenpromised that it would swell American coffers to “pay for infrastructure, child care, and clean energy.” Both things can’t be true. The Europeans, and some opportunistic Third World governments, would gain revenue at the expense of the U.S."
