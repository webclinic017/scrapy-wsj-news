    "body": "Sometimes sharply rising fuel prices don’t end up being inflationary. Unfortunately, this may not be one of those times.<br />The Commerce Department on Thursday reported that consumer prices rose 0.6% in February from January, putting them 6.4% above their year-earlier level. A fair portion of that gain came about as a result of the higher prices Americans were paying at the pump. With regular gasoline averaging $4.22 a gallon in the U.S. in March versus a February average of $3.52, according to the Energy Information Administration, the March inflation figure seems bound to come in even hotter."
