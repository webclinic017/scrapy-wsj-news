    "body": "The Biden administration’s tentative plan for a rollout of second Covid-19 booster doses in the fall is being roiled by funding questions.<br />The White House has been considering making second booster doses available to the general public around the same time they would get their annual flu shots, if research finds the extra shot shores up immunity. But Congress hasn’t appropriated any more money for buying the additional boosters and other pandemic measures."
