    "body": "Selling out of Russia isn’t as painful for Western oil and gas supermajors as the scale of their write-downs would suggest. But it will further diminish their global relevance relative to the real giants of the fossil-fuel industry today: state-controlled national oil companies.<br />As the global response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has escalated, independent oil and gas companies have headed for the exit.  Exxon Mobil  became the latest shoe to drop late Tuesday, following  BP ,   Equinor  and  Shell .  Given a dearth of buyers and the complexity of selling within a web of sanctions, they will likely have to impair or even write off a combined $22 billion of assets."
