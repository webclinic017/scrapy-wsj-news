    "body": "Spotify Technology SA  is suspending its service in Russia, the company said, refusing to comply with recent laws that require the audio streaming giant to censor content in the country.<br />The Swedish company earlier this month closed its Russian office and put restrictions on users’ ability to find shows put out by Russian state media. It also removed content from Russia’s state-backed RT and Sputnik in the European Union and other markets, after the EU suspended their licenses. At the time, Spotify said it was important to keep its service operational in Russia to allow for the flow of information."
