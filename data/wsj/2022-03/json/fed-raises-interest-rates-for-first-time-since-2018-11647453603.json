    "body": "The Federal Reserve said it would lift interest rates and penciled in a series of further increases this year aimed at stopping the economy from overheating and reducing inflation that is running at its highest levels in four decades.<br />Fed officials said Wednesday they would raise their benchmark federal-funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a range between 0.25% and 0.5% from near zero. Most of them projected pushing it up to at least the level that prevailed before the Covid-19 pandemic hit the U.S. economy two years ago, which would be consistent with raising interest rates at every scheduled meeting this year."
