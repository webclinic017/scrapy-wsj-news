    "body": "Activision Blizzard Inc.  is facing a lawsuit by the parents of a former employee who allege that sexual harassment at the videogame giant led to her death at a corporate retreat and that her supervisor and the company didn’t fully cooperate with police afterward.<br />Kerri Moynihan, whose 2017 death was ruled a suicide, had been the subject of sexual harassment, including an incident in which co-workers passed around a photo of her vagina, the complaint alleges. Her parents, Paul and Janet Moynihan, were unaware of those matters, it says, until a California agency filed suit against  Activision  in July alleging widespread sexual harassment at the company. The company has disputed the agency’s allegations."
