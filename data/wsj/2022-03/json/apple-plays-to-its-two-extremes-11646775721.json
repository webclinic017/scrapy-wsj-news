    "body": "Never known for cheap products, even  Apple  has to segment its customer base.<br />That was evident at the company’s latest product unveiling Tuesday. As widely expected, Apple announced the third update to its iPhone SE, the lowest-priced smartphone in its catalog. But the company also introduced a new high-end desktop computer called the Mac Studio featuring a monster new chip from its M1 line of processors. That computer starts at $1,599 and requires a display—such as the new one Apple also introduced Tuesday—that also starts at $1,599."
