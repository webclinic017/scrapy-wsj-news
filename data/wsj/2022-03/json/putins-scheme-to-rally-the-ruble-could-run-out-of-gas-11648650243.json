    "body": "After making the ruble unpalatable to investors and savers, President Vladimir Putin is trying to engineer extra demand for the Russian currency from its only remaining market: captive commodity buyers. But that well may be almost dry.<br />On Wednesday the ruble rose back to around where it was on Feb. 24, the day Russia first invaded Ukraine, both against the U.S. dollar and the euro. Capital controls and interest rates increasing to 20% from 9.5% are among the reasons why the exchange rate has decoupled from the Russian economy, which is forecast to contract 5.7% this year due to the West’s sanctions, according to FocusEconomics."
