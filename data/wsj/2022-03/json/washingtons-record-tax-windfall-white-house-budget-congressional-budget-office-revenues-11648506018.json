    "body": "The Biden Administration on Monday rolled out a fiscal 2023 budget proposal of $5.79 trillion. That’s 31% more than in 2019, the last pre-Covid year, which is staggering enough. But the real budget news that Washington would prefer that Americans not know is that tax revenue is booming.<br />The money has been rolling in, as the most recent Congressional Budget Office figures show. In the first five months of fiscal 2022 through February, federal receipts climbed a remarkable 26% from a year earlier. That’s $371 billion more—to $1.8 trillion in five months. Individual income taxes rose $271 billion, or 38%, to $975 billion. Corporate income taxes rose 31%, or $28 billion, to $117 billion."
