    "body": "Your editorial “Taking Dictators Literally and Seriously” (March 5) is a timely reminder of democracy’s tendency to hear appalling propositions by dictatorships and discount their reality.<br />During the 1930s, many educated people heard Hitler’s rantings about the Jews and his desire to conquer “living space” in the east but thought he was just playing to the domestic audience and did not need to be taken seriously. Yet, as one academic has correctly observed, “Except where he pledged his word, Hitler always meant what he said.” A good thing to keep in mind regarding Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and others."
