    "body": "Rio Tinto  PLC offered to pay roughly $2.7 billion to buy out minority shareholders in Canada’s  Turquoise Hill  Resources Ltd., which controls a giant copper-mining operation in Mongolia, a bet on copper being in high demand.<br />Rio Tinto’s proposal to take over the company in which it owns about 51% comes as commodity prices are running hot, fanned by concerns that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could disrupt supplies. Russia is an important producer and exporter of a number of commodities, including copper, whose price is close to record highs."
