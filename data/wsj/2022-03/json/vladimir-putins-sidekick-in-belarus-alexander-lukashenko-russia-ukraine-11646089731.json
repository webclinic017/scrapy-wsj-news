    "body": "If there is ever a Nuremberg-style tribunal for war crimes in Ukraine, Vladimir Putin won’t be the only one in the dock. Right next to him could be Alexander Lukashenko, president of Belarus and co-aggressor against its peaceable neighbor.<br />Mr. Lukashenko takes orders from Mr. Putin like a boot-camp private. He has allowed Russian troops and tanks to mass on his border with Ukraine, the easier to make a quick strike on Kyiv. Russia has launched missiles from Belarussian soil at Ukraine."
