    "body": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York leader John Williams said Friday that he is open to the central bank doing a half-percentage-point interest rate increase if the economy’s outlook calls for it, while stopping short of saying such an action is likely.<br />The Fed will be “steadily” moving rates up going forward and “we need to be nimble and be able to adjust as we go along the way,” Mr. Williams said as part of a virtual appearance. As for what happens at a given meeting, it will be up to how the economy is performing and is expected to perform, he said."
