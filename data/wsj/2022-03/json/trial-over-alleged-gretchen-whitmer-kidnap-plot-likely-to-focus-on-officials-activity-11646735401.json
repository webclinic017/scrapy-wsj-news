    "time": "2022-03-08 05:30:00",
    "body": "The outcome of the trial of four men facing federal charges of conspiring to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020 could hinge on whether the prosecution can show they were likely to commit the crime even without the encouragement and logistical support provided by government informants.<br />The prosecution’s case, which starts Tuesday with jury selection in Grand Rapids, Mich., is based largely on testimony from cooperating informants, undercover agents and recorded texts, online chats and phone calls, according to the October 2020 complaint. The complaint details the alleged plotters’ extensive training with firearms and explosives, meetings held in a business with a concealed trap door and surveillance missions near the governor’s summer home."
