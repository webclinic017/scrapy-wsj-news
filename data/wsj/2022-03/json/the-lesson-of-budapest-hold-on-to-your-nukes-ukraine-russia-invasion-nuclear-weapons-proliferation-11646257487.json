    "body": "Powerful images of the Ukrainian people’s unexpectedly stiff resistance to Russian invasion have shined a spotlight on the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. Under the agreement, Ukraine gave up the nuclear weapons on its territory. In exchange for this concession, Russia and the West pledged to respect the former Soviet state’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.<br />Then, in 2014, Russia seized Crimea, territory that was indisputably Ukrainian. Naturally, Ukrainians wondered whether they had left themselves exposed by giving up their nuclear deterrent 20 years earlier. Today, as Russia aims to subjugate the entire country, that question is again on at the front of Ukrainians’ minds.​Many countries, including malign actors watching Russia’s actions, will inevitably now seek their own nukes. Vladimir Putin is demonstrating that these weapons give an aggressor license to attack and that without them, a peaceful nation is at the aggressor’s mercy."
