    "body": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to deliver a plea from the West: pump more oil.<br />The British leader is acting as an emissary as the de facto leaders of the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia shun entreaties from President Biden to discuss energy policy. Oil prices rose sharply following Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine on concerns about supply disruptions. The West needs oil production from the Middle East to increase as it looks to wean European nations off Russian oil and gas, while avoiding soaring energy bills for voters at home."
