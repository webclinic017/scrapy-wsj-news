    "body": "This fact-based saga leaves no doubt about the reasons companies fail. Co-founder Adam Neumann (Jared Leto) of the startup WeWork saw that enterprise, a pioneer in the coworking business, achieve a mighty valuation of $47 billion in 2019 and thereafter proceed to a calamitous decline, the causes for which “WeCrashed” (begins Friday, with three of its eight episodes, on Apple TV+) regularly suggests—incapacity, poor judgment and excess of every sort prime among them. But all isn’t loss and struggle in this tale—based on the podcast of the same name—borne up by its unfailing energy and, above all, the distinguished performances of Mr. Leto and Anne Hathaway, in the role of Rebekah, Adam’s wife and business partner. Both inhabit their characters so persuasively, relate to one another—and the world—so credibly that it becomes impossible not to feel the depth of their connection.<br />That’s no small power in a story filled with posturing and role playing—what else are the pumped-up celebrations of Mondays and related cheerleading exercises on the part of obedient employees we meet everywhere in this series?"
