    "body": "One of the youngest of the numerous children his father had sired, Benjamin Franklin soon discovered that his education would be his own responsibility. This did not deter the child destined to become a world-famous scientist—as well as a signer of both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution—from following the instincts that directed him to learning at whatever cost, to devour books, to wake up especially early so as to have time to read. His reading of the Bible began, we learn, at the age of 5. Such is the portrait of young Ben in “Benjamin Franklin,” a two-part documentary by Ken Burns and a work enhanced by its capacity for sustaining a touch of nuance along with its roaring vitality. It’s a combination potently evident in the character of the adult Franklin, voiced, effectively, by Mandy Patinkin.<br />That said, it’s true as well that nothing about this work equals the powers of the range and the detail of the historic events woven into the narrative: in particular, the sustained view of life in the colonies—especially, the Americans’ growing resentment toward Britain, for which they had ample cause. In 1765, for example, came word that all books, all legal documents, would—according to a new ruling by Parliament—require official stamps, to be purchased from the government. Here was the Stamp Act, another tax."
