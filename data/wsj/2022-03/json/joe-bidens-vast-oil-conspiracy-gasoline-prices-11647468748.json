    "body": "President Biden is adopting Donald Trump’s habit of venting his political frustrations on  Twitter .  “Oil prices are decreasing, gas prices should too,” Mr. Biden tweeted Wednesday. “Oil and gas companies shouldn’t pad their profits at the expense of hardworking Americans.” Sorry, Mr. President. There’s no vast industry conspiracy to raise gasoline prices.<br />Gas prices almost always rise faster than they fall, as the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis explained in a 2014 report. “When oil prices rise after being steady for some time—gasoline prices shoot up quickly,” the Fed paper explained. “In contrast, when oil prices fall after being steady for some time, gasoline prices retreat slowly.”"
