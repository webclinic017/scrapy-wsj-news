    "body": "SEOUL—North Korea has launched a suspected ballistic missile off its east coast on Saturday local time, South Korean and Japanese officials said, as Pyongyang continues its recent spree of weapons activity.<br />The missile was fired at 8:48 a.m. from the North’s Sunan region, which is located just outside Pyongyang, Seoul’s military said. It had a steep trajectory, hitting an altitude of about 340 miles and traveling about 185 miles before splashing into the waters between Korea and Japan, according to an initial Tokyo assessment."
