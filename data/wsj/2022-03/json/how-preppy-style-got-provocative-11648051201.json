    "body": "FOR A RECENT dinner party, New York stylist Rachael Wang layered a little black dress over one of the roomy blue-and-white striped “banker” shirts that she’s lately been wearing more days than not. “The collar was the thing that really popped,” she said of the “preppy but modernized” ensemble. “It was just the right amount of subversive.”<br />The preppy look is undergoing a vibe revamp. Designers such as Miuccia Prada and Michael Kors remixed the style on the spring runways, and on-the-pulse teens show off their own prep mashups on TikTok. Today’s reinterpretations are nostalgic but off-kilter enough to thoroughly confound your Aunt Biffy. From the itty-bitty, belly-button-baring tweed suits Doja Cat and Saweetie sport in their “Best Friend” video to the argyle-heavy wardrobe of adolescent playwright Lexi (Maude Apatow) on “Euphoria,” modern prep adheres to a more daring set of guiding principles than the 10 tenets (practicality, Anglophilia, quality and androgyny among them) prescribed by Lisa Birnbach’s irreverent 1980 bible “The Official Preppy Handbook.” Rickie De Sole, women’s designer fashion and editorial director at  Nordstrom ,  which has loaded up on plenty of preppy-ish pieces for the season, sums up the new look as “twisted prep.” Here, five refreshed staples—and how to ace them."
