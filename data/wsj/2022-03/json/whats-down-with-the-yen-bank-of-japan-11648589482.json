    "body": "Central banks are going their own way as they look for a path out of the extraordinary monetary policies of recent years—and to reduce the inflation that has come with it. The process poses economic risks, as the sharp fall in the Japanese yen is showing.<br />Japan’s currency on Monday burst through the sort of “psychologically important” floor forex traders obsess over, briefly sinking to 125 yen to the dollar before settling at 123.93. (The fewer yen it takes to buy one dollar, the stronger Japan’s currency is.) This marks a depreciation of about 12% in six months."
