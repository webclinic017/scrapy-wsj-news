    "body": "Federico da Montefeltro, an esteemed but ruthless mercenary captain, a bastard child who became Duke of Urbino, a renowned humanist who turned little Urbino into a dazzling European court, also commissioned one of the most fascinating paintings of the 15th century.<br />It goes by various names: “Madonna and Child With Saints, Angels and Federico da Montefeltro,” the Montefeltro Altarpiece, the San Bernardino Altarpiece, and the Brera Altarpiece, a reference to its home at the Pinacoteca di Brera in Milan. By any name, the painting (1472-74), a tranquil view of Mary surrounded by saints and the man who paid for it, is sublime. Serene, sculptural, luminous, muted in color and masterly in its creation of an illusionistic space, the altarpiece crystallizes the extraordinary talents of its creator, Piero della Francesca."
