    "body": "While it is hard to argue with Karl Rove’s conclusion that Democrats will “pay a fearsome price” in the midterms for their mistakes (“Midterm Strategy Pulls Democrats Apart,” op-ed, March 24), never underestimate the ability of the GOP to seize defeat from the jaws of victory.<br />Rather than hit the softballs the Democrats are tossing them—an inflation rate not seen since 1982, a failed foreign policy and skyrocketing crime rates—GOP candidates concentrate on hyperrestrictive abortion laws served up by GOP legislatures and governors, and on former President Donald Trump, most notably the allegedly stolen 2020 election."
