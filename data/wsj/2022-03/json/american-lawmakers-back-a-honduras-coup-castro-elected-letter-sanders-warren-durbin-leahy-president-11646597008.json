    "body": "In a Feb. 17 letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Sen. Bernie Sanders and a couple of his socialist sidekicks in the House—Reps. Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley—came out in favor of U.S. imperialism in Honduras. The missive didn’t get wide coverage. But there’s no mistaking what they’re up to.<br />Progressives see in leftist Honduran President Xiomara Castro a unique opportunity to impose their socialist, woke agenda on the conservative Central American nation. If meeting their ends requires treating the nation like a U.S. colony and flouting democracy, so be it."
