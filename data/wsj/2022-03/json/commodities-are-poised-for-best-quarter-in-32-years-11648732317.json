    "body": "Commodities are on track for their best quarter in more than 30 years after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine supercharged a rally in markets from oil to wheat and nickel.<br />The war has disrupted traffic on goods coming out of the Black Sea, curtailing supply and sparking sharp price swings across financial markets. Nervous investors are weighing the fallout from the conflict along with higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve, which could threaten the economy’s postpandemic recovery.  At the same time, a sharp run-up in commodities prices has some investors and economists worried about inflation jumping even higher from here."
