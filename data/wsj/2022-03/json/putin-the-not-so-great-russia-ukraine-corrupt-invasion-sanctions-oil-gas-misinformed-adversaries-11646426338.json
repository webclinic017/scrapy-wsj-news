    "body": "BP, the London-based oil company, has put out some content-less press releases in its time but none like the one issued this week under pressure from British politicians saying it will somehow dispose of its stake in  Rosneft ,  the Russian oil giant and pillar of the Putin regime. If a buyer can even be found, some Chinese or Middle Eastern oligarch will certainly end up happy, but it’s hard to see how any worthwhile cause is advanced.<br />Still, the episode is a colorful ending to BP’s colorful Russia adventure. For bringing its formidable expertise to the country in 1998, it’s been repaid with multiple oligarch shakedowns, threatened arrest of its global CEO, and an imaginative tax dispute after the British government insisted on investigating the murder of a Putin critic in London."
