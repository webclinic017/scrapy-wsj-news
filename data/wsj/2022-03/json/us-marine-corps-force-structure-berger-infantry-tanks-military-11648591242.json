    "body": "Jim Webb’s op-ed “Momentous Changes in the U.S. Marine Corps’ Force Organization Deserve Debate” (March 26) discusses concerns that 22 retired four-star generals have raised about Gen. David Berger’s proposed changes to force structure. If this proposal is so dangerous, why aren’t active duty Marines speaking out? After all, they are the ones who may pay the ultimate price if the commandant is wrong.<br />Active-duty Marines aren’t speaking up because our institutional culture in the Marine Corps demands extreme deference to authority, rewards conformity and punishes candor. The Marine Corps selects those who provide the answers that the boss wants to hear. The most important leadership traits are tact and loyalty—to one’s boss. The result is an organization that can’t render an honest and compelling justification for any major initiative."
