    "body": "<br />Noted Hollywood producer Samuel Goldwyn purportedly once said, “If you want to send a message, call Western Union.” Herein lies an essential truth: Too often it is assumed that for a film to be lasting or significant it must say something about society or politics, but the glorious tradition of American comic filmmaking shows the opposite is true. From the Marx Brothers’ “Monkey Business” to Blake Edwards’s “The Pink Panther,” some of the best films ever made are those that aim no higher, or lower, than inducing laughter."
