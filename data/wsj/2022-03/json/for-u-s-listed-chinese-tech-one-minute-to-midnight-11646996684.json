    "body": "The clock is ticking a lot louder for Chinese stocks listed in the U.S. The big winner may ultimately be a key rival to U.S. bourses: the Hong Kong exchange.<br />The Securities and Exchange Commission said on Thursday it has named five companies for failing to hire an auditor that could be inspected by U.S. regulators. These companies include Chinese companies like  Yum China ,  the operator of KFC and Pizza Hut in the country, and biotech company  BeiGene .  Under legislation passed in 2020, they could be delisted if U.S. regulators can’t review their audits for three consecutive years—meaning 2024 at the earliest."
