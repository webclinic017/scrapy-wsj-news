    "body": "WASHINGTON—Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) doubled down Friday on his call for the Russian people to assassinate or overthrow Russian President Vladimir Putin, even after a backlash from the White House and peers in Congress who said Mr. Graham had gone too far, as well as from Russian officials, who accused him of advocating for terrorism.<br />“That is not the position of the United States government and certainly not a statement you’d hear come from the mouth of anybody working in this administration,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday."
