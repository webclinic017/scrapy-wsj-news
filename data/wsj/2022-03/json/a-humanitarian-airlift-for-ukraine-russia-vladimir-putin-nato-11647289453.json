    "body": "Vladimir Putin seems intent on bombing Ukrainian cities into submission, with civilian suffering and casualties intended as part of the strategy. The West needs to do more to relieve the human tragedy, and the best idea we’ve seen so far is an international humanitarian airlift.<br />Douglas Feith and John Hannah explain the idea in broad terms nearby. This wouldn’t be a military no-fly zone, or even a no-go zone for Western Ukraine, which may be what has to happen before this war is over. In the meantime an airlift would provide food and water, medicine and other nonmilitary supplies to cities like Mariupol, Kherson, Kharkiv and others besieged by Russian forces. Kyiv will be next."
