    "body": "There’s circumstantial evidence that Covid-19 originated from a lab leak in Wuhan, China, and this week brings into focus a new contagion from that country. Beijing’s zero-Covid policies, once lauded in some quarters in the West, are becoming a danger to the Chinese and global economies as the virus returns.<br />A new Covid outbreak appears to be underway in China. Official case counts, at about 5,000 a day earlier this week, are at levels not seen since the start of the pandemic. This appears to be driven by the Omicron variant, which burned through most Western countries weeks ago. The outbreaks are concentrated in northeastern Jilin Province and near Hong Kong in the south, but cases are popping up across the country."
