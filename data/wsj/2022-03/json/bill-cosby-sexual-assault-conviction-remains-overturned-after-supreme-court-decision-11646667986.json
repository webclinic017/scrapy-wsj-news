    "body": "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear a case brought by prosecutors in Pennsylvania, effectively allowing a state court decision that had overturned actor Bill Cosbyâ€™s sexual assault conviction to stand.<br />Mr. Cosby, 84 years old, was convicted in 2018 of drugging and assaulting Andrea Constand, a former Temple University staff member. He had been serving a three-to-10-year sentence when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered his release in June."
