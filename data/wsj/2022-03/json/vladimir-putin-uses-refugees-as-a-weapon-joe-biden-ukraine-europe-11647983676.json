    "body": "As Vladimir Putin’s Ukraine invasion bogs down, he’s trying to break Kyiv’s resistance by targeting civilians with missiles and artillery. He also hopes to break European support for Ukraine by using the country’s refugees as a political weapon. The U.S. can help Europe share this refugee burden.<br />That’s the horrible state of war as more than 3.5 million Ukrainians have fled the country since the invasion began, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Another six million or so have left their homes but remain in Ukraine, though they may eventually have to leave too."
