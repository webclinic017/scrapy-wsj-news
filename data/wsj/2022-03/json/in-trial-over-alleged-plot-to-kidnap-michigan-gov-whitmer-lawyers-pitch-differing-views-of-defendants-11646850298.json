    "body": "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.—Lawyers in the criminal trial of four men accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2020 painted contrasting portraits of the defendants in opening statements Wednesday, with prosecutors deeming them a “kill squad” and defense lawyers portraying them as naive misfits motivated by marijuana and free beer.<br />A federal prosecutor said the two leaders of the group were bent on hastening a second civil war. “This was not just talk,” said Jonathan Roth, an assistant U.S. Attorney, after reading quotes from some of the suspects, including one who said he planned to die “a f—g saint drenched in blood,” in a war with government officials, including Gov. Whitmer. “Their actions were louder and just as disturbing as their words.”"
