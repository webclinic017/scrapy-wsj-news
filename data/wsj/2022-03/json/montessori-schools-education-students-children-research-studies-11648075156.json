    "body": "In reviewing “The Child is the Teacher” (Bookshelf, March 17), Barbara Spindel asks how those “unpinned butterflies,” the children free in Montessori classrooms, turned out. Two lottery-control studies in public Montessori schools showed that Montessori 5-year-olds had better math and reading performance, better social skills and knowledge, more advanced moral reasoning and higher executive function. Findings with lower-income 5-year-olds are particularly impressive. Montessori 12-year-olds wrote more complex and creative stories, were more socially adept and had a stronger sense of their schools as communities. Another study showed higher adult well being among Montessori grads.<br />Former Montessori students recall liking school at higher rates, and learning is what they recall liking most about it. Black children in Montessori are significantly more proficient on states’ third-grade math exams, and all groups were more proficient on reading and language exams in third and eighth grades. They performed worse on math exams in third grade but slightly better in eighth."
