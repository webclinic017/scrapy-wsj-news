Ira Harris returned to his hometown of New York to look for a job in the securities industry.<br />He collected 32 letters of rejection before a friendâ€™s father helped him get a job at Jacques Coe & Co. One of his early assignments was to sell mutual funds door to door. Starting at the top floor of an apartment building, he worked his way down, collecting more experience in dealing with rejection."
