    "body": "What happens in Ukraine is a matter of freedom, life and death for the courageous resisters to Vladimir Putin’s invasion (“Ukraine Leads the World,” Review & Outlook, Feb. 28). It also matters to the fate of political freedom in the world. Ukraine is the Gettysburg of our time. Read Lincoln’s immortal words: Gettysburg was not only about us, but also about our obligation to promote freedom in the world in a thoughtful yet committed manner. Gettysburg is also a symbol of the sacrifice this can require. I have read about the “rapture” that Ukraine resisters share in risking their lives together to protect their freedom. The flame is alive in them. Is it with us?<br />Em. Prof. Donald A. Downs"
