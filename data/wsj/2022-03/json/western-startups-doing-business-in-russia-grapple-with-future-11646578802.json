    "body": "Startups based in the U.S. and Europe with employees and customers in Russia are facing a choiceâ€”get out completely or try to preserve a future in the country.<br />For some private technology companies, the decline of the ruble, Western sanctions or moral objections to the invasion of Ukraine are pushing them to leave Russia. Others expect to maintain a base in Russia while diversifying into other markets.
