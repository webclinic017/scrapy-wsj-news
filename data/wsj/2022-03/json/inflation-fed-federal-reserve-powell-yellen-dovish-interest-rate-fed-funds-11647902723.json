    "body": "Mickey Levy’s op-ed “Let’s Start Getting Interest Rates Up” (March 15) is right on point. The Federal Reserve Board’s bias toward keeping interest rates obscenely low has fueled high inflation and a bubble in the capital markets, putting the economy at risk.<br />Savers have been slammed; drivers, consumers and businesses whacked with price increases; and the middle class and less fortunate see their pay and pension checks devalued every day. Everybody in America knew inflation was raging even before Russia invaded Ukraine, but the slow-moving Fed was unwilling to fight it by raising rates or cutting its purchases of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities. If Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his predecessor Janet Yellen—now Treasury secretary—were any more dovish, their mugs could be on the cover of “The Book of Birds.”"
