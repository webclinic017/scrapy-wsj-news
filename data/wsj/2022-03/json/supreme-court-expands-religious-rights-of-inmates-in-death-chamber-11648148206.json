    "body": "WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Thursday blocked Texas from executing an inmate after the state refused to let his minister pray and lay hands on him in the death chamber. In a separate case, the court unanimously ruled that a local elected official who was censured by fellow board members couldn’t sue them for retaliation.<br />In a third action Thursday, the court temporarily stopped New Jersey from withdrawing from a crime-fighting agency it has jointly operated with New York state since the 1953, freezing the status quo while it considers whether to hear Albany’s argument that a bistate agreement prevents Trenton from unilaterally dissolving the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor."
