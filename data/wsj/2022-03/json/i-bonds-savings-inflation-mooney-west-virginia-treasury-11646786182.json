    "body": "It’s no surprise that we have an inflation crisis when the Biden administration spent trillions of dollars in the past year. Inflation erodes the value of our savings, and low interest rates make the loss even worse. We save to achieve financial goals like purchasing a new home, paying for college and retiring. If the erosion of savings continues, all Americans will suffer.<br />Joshua Rauh and Kevin Warsh’s op-ed “The Inflation Mess and a Financial Refuge” (Feb. 22) raises an intriguing solution to this savings problem. They call on Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to raise the annual cap on Series I savings bonds."
