    "body": "Peggy Noonan writes a moving paean to the heroism of Volodymyr Zelensky (“The World, Moved, Needs to Move Cautiously,” Declarations, March 12). But she concludes with some deflating and incorrect assumptions about Russian escalation.<br />I agree the West should push hard for diplomacy, though we shouldn’t coerce Ukraine to make concessions that it thinks would negate its long-term sovereignty. Time is not on Russia’s side, and the sooner the Kremlin can overcome a solipsistic rage over sunk costs from a delusional and brutal war of choice, the better. Still, the final thesis of Ms. Noonan’s column is that despite our admiration for Mr. Zelensky and ordinary Ukrainians, we should be weary of supporting Kyiv to the hilt because “escalation poses threats far beyond its borders,” including nuclear threats. In her view, the West should tamp its enthusiasm for helping the Ukrainians resist."
