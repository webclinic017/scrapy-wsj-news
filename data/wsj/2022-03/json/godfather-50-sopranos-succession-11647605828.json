    "body": "To grasp why Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather has been so popular for 50 years, Al Pacino suggests starting at the film’s opening, when an immigrant father asks Don Vito Corleone for justice after the police have ignored an assault on his daughter.<br />“Many people have felt that need throughout history, the feeling of being overlooked, neglected and abandoned,” says Pacino, who played the Don’s son Michael, via email. “That could be what attracted such a large audience: a godfather who will be there for you, who will help you, in a human way, in a family way.”"
