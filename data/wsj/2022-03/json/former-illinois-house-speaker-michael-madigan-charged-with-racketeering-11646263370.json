    "body": "CHICAGO—Former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan was indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury on charges of racketeering conspiracy, bribery, wire fraud and extortion. The 22-count indictment comes a little more than a year after he was voted out by the Democratic Party caucus as the longest-serving state house speaker in U.S. history.<br />Mr. Madigan, 79 years old, faced a yearslong probe into alleged schemes, including allegations that Commonwealth Edison, the state’s largest utility, had handed out jobs and internships to his associates to pass friendly legislation."
