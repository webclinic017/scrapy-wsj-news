    "body": "Houston has set the standard for bringing workers back to the office during Covid-19. About 85% of its businesses have employees at their desks or have plans to do so, one of the highest rates in the nation, according to firms that track the return-to-office trend.<br />But Houston office floors are barely half full. While the number of workers showing up at their desks has been steadily rising, the office crowds are far smaller than those showing up at restaurants, basketball games and other traditional gathering spots."
