    "body": "The Russian military earlier this month announced the creation of safe routes to allow Ukrainians to flee major cities, including Kharkiv, Mariupol and Kyiv. Humanitarian corridors are often necessary to protect civilians during wartime, but their use can also lead to even greater death. Once a city is presumed clear of noncombatants, the enemy has an excuse to level the area. From Grozny to Aleppo, humanitarian corridors have precipitated countless civilians deaths as militaries shell nonmilitary targets without limit.<br />Such is the paradox of modern war. A strategy that looks attractive and de-escalatory on paper can create riper conditions for war crimes and military escalation, leading to the systematic destruction of an entire city and greater civilian casualties."
