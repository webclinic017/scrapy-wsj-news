    "body": "Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson’s record in sentencing child-pornography offenders became a focus of her confirmation hearings this week after a handful of Republican senators claimed she had been too lenient. Her supporters, meanwhile, said her record was consistent with how other federal judges, both Democratic and Republican appointees, handle such cases.
