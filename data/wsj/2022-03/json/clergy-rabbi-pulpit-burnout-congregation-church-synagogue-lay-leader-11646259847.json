    "body": "“More Pulpits Empty in Difficult Times” (U.S. News, Feb. 22) underscores the utter exhaustion felt by clergy due to the Covid-19 pandemic and even the demands of the pulpit pre-Covid. The Modern Orthodox rabbinate, which I see through my work at the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, is experiencing some of this burnout as well. Anti-Semitism is also weighing heavily on rabbis. Who knew when they were ordained that they would have to become experts in building security?<br />Most rabbis I encounter are dedicated to their congregations and feel much satisfaction from their hard work and the never-ending need to build relationships with congregants. They are proud of keeping their congregations engaged during Covid with imagination and creativity. To be sure, the Covid dialogue frayed relationships. But the wise among us understand that this is temporary."
