    "body": "If the inhabitants of the new half-hour Fox comedy “Welcome to Flatch” were all 7 years old, they might be funny. They are decidedly neither. “Recent studies,” says an introductory title, “show that Americans long for a simple life in small towns.” Why that shouldn’t be is the point of the show, which doesn’t quite resort to comedy meth labs or opioid jokes for laughs—though you’re a bit surprised it doesn’t, given the awkwardly derisive way it sets out to establish that the Midwest is not just nowhere but going there fast.<br />Admittedly, if “Flatch” were genuinely smart or funny it might be forgiven its offenses, the nature of which are surprising given the show’s pedigree. One of the executive producers is Paul Feig; the show’s developer is Jenny Bicks of “Sex and the City,” although “Flatch” is an adaptation of the BBC series “This Country.” Mr. Feig, who also wrote or directed several “Flatch” episodes, is probably best known for directing “Bridesmaids,” but back in 1999 he created a little TV masterpiece called “Freaks and Geeks,” which possessed among other fine qualities a warmly generous treatment of its often socially clumsy characters. There’s very little of that feeling in the new series, which in its exploration of humble, rural Ohio finds boredom and stasis and, perhaps as homage, emulates the same qualities."
