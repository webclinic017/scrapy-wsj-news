    "body": "With food and medicine supplies threatened across Ukraine, domestic and international food manufacturers, distributors and aid workers are mobilizing to keep grocery stores and pharmacies open and shelves stocked.<br />In recent days, much of Ukraine’s domestic food production and distribution ground to a halt, triggering shortages in parts of the country, especially in areas hardest hit by the Russian invasion. So far, that hasn’t escalated into widespread hunger, thanks in part to a domestic and international effort to get food around the country."
