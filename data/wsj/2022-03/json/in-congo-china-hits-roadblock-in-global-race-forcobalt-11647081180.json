    "body": "For more than a decade, Chinese companies have spent billions of dollars buying out U.S. and European miners in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s cobalt belt—the world’s richest source of a mineral that has become critical to the global transition to cleaner energy. Now the Chinese firms are running into trouble after a court ordered one of the largest to temporarily cede control of one of its mines.<br />Just one electric vehicle can require between 10 and 30 pounds of cobalt to build its battery, depending on the manufacturer, though  Tesla Inc.  and other auto makers are now moving away from the material. Cobalt can boost charge rates and has a stabilizing effect, extending battery life and preventing cathode corrosion that can lead to battery fires."
