    "body": "“Of course!” says Spanish shoe designer Manolo Blahnik via email when he’s asked if he’s ever worn Birkenstocks. In fact, the stiletto king of the Canary Islands loves his Birkenstocks so much, he and his niece Kristina Blahnik, the CEO of his namesake brand, appeared in the company’s ad campaign two years ago. He prefers the Boston, a closed-toe slipperlike style, in black. “I wear them in my garden almost every day,” he says. “They have practically molded to my feet.”<br />Manolo Blahnik has been on the Birkenstock bandwagon since the 1970s, when he got his first pair. “They’re timeless!” he says. “Probably every single person in the business owns a pair of Birkenstocks and has done forever,” says Kristina Blahnik."
