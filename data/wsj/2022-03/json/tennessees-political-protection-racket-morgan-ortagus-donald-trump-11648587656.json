    "body": "The filing deadline to run for a U.S. House seat in Tennessee is next week, yet on Monday the state Legislature moved to change the rules by creating a three-year residency requirement. The bill is a flagrant attempt to sideline an outsider candidate backed by President Trump, and it may be unconstitutional.<br />Morgan Ortagus worked as a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump’s State Department before she moved to Nashville in 2021. After lawmakers drew new political maps this year, Rep. Jim Cooper, the incumbent Democrat in the 5th District, decided to retire from Congress. The race to replace him includes a herd of Republicans, including Ms. Ortagus."
