He then apparently quit his post.<br />Ambassador Arturo McFields, who last year was named envoy to the OAS, said he was speaking on behalf of thousands of public servants in Nicaragua who are afraid to speak their minds for fear of losing their jobs. He also invoked the nearly 200 political prisoners and more than 350 people killed, most by state security forces, since massive protests in 2018 that shook the government of President Daniel Ortega."
