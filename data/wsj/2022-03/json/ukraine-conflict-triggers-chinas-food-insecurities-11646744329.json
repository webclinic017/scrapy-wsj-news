    "body": "Food security and self-sufficiency have long been high on the agenda of Chinese policy makers. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine gives Beijing more reasons to focus on the issue. Weaning itself off imported foodstuffs would mean more investment into the biotechnology industry and more widespread use of genetically modified food.<br />Over the weekend, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated the importance of being self-sufficient in food, according to state news agency Xinhua. “The rice bowls of the Chinese people have to be filled mainly with Chinese grain,” he said."
