    "body": "Anaplan  wasn’t the cheapest cloud stock—nor the most beaten down. Both points should help buoy a battered sector.<br />The maker of cloud-based software used for business planning and analytics said late Sunday it struck a deal to be acquired by private-equity player Thoma Bravo for $10.7 billion in cash. The per-share price tag of $66 represents a 40% premium to the price Anaplan was fetching late last week, before a pair of activist investors reported sizable stakes in the company. It’s also roughly on par with the stock’s price in early November, before market sentiment began to turn against cloud companies and other richly valued sectors."
