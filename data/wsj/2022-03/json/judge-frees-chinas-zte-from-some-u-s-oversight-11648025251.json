    "body": "HONG KONG—A U.S. judge ruled that  ZTE Corp.’s  probation for violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran could end, freeing the Chinese technology company from some oversight following years of government supervision.<br />The decision by the federal judge in Texas effectively ends ZTE’s five-year term of supervision under a Dallas lawyer assigned to police the company’s adherence to the terms of its 2017 settlement agreement resolving the sanctions charges."
