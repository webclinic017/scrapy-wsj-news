    "body": "European Union antitrust officials gave a green light to  Amazon.com Inc.’s  proposed $6.5 billion acquisition of movie studio MGM, clearing one hurdle for the e-commerce giant ahead of a deadline for the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to deliver a verdict on the deal.<br />The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm and its top competition regulator, said Tuesday that it has approved the deal without conditions. The commission said the deal wouldn’t significantly reduce competition in part because the two companies don’t significantly overlap in content production and that MGM content “cannot be considered as must-have.”"
