    "body": "Confusion over whether Russia’s foreign bondholders will receive payments that were due Wednesday put the spotlight on the bank at the center of it all: Citigroup Inc.<br />The bank acts as the paying agent, charged with receiving and processing payments into bondholders’ accounts for the two dollar-denominated bonds issued by Russia. Russia’s Ministry of Finance said Thursday that it had passed funds for servicing those bonds on to Citi’s London branch. Bondholders were owed $117 million by Wednesday."
