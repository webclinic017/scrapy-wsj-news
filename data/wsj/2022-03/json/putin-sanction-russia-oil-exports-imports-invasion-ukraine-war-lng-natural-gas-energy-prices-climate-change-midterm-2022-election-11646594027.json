    "body": "American politicians are suddenly scrambling to ban the U.S. purchase of Russian oil, and the Biden Administration seems likely to go along. Too bad this is a largely symbolic gesture that ducks the main issue: whether to sanction all Russian energy exports.<br />Oil and gas revenue makes up about half of the Kremlin’s budget and is critical to financing Vladimir Putin’s bloody war on Ukraine. The problem is that sanctions on Russian energy could also harm the world economy and especially Europe, which imports about 25% of its oil and 40% of its natural gas from Russia. But unless the West is willing to grasp this nettle, the world will continue to finance the Putin war machine."
