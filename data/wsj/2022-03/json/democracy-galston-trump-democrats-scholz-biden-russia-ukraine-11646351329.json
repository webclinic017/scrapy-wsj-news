    "body": "Elaine Kamarck and William Galston (“Will Democrats Throw It All Away in 2024?” op-ed, Feb. 26) view Donald Trump as the primary threat to our democracy. They avoid mentioning the real challenge to our institutions: the Democrats’ hubristic plans to pack the Supreme Court, add new blue states to pack the Senate and end the Electoral College.<br />Ms. Kamarck and Mr. Galston also fail to address the radical assumptions underlying the Democrats’ agenda: the identity politics that divides Americans and promotes enmity, a socialist materialism that denies our country’s founding ideals, especially individual freedom, and an extreme concept of justice overriding common sense and driving a remaking of the family, schools and society. Thoughtful independent and Democratic voters will stand up for the great American tradition and oppose this agenda."
