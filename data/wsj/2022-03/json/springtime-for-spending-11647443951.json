    "body": "The bite that inflation is taking out of Americans’ spending power just keeps getting bigger, especially with the surge in gasoline prices since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But with Covid-19 worries in retreat, people might keep spending more nonetheless.<br />The Commerce Department on Wednesday reported that retail sales rose 0.3% in February from January, which was a tad lower that the 0.4% gain economists anticipated. But January’s sales figures were revised significantly higher and now show a monthly gain of 4.9% versus a previously reported 3.8%. Retail sales were 17.6% higher year over year, handily outpacing the overall increase in consumer prices. Through the first two months of the first quarter, at least, it looks as if the American consumer was doing fine."
