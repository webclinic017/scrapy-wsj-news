    "body": "Wishful thinking has led economic forecasters to underestimate inflation over the past year. Observers correctly identify one factor that would bring inflation down while missing other, inextricably linked factors that would raise it. The latest examples: expectations of a dramatic reduction in inflation as people return to the workforce, consumers switch from buying goods to services, and the pandemic recedes.<br />In February 2022, there were 2.3 million fewer people in the labor force than before the pandemic, after adjusting for changes in the age distribution. It is plausible that most of these people will return to the labor force, adding 200,000 jobs a month over the coming year and raising the labor-force participation rate by about a percentage point. Many have argued that these returning workers will expand supply and bring down nominal wage and price pressures."
