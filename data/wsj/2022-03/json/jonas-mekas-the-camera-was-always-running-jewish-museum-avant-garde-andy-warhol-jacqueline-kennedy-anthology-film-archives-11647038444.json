    "body": "New York<br />‘Jonas Mekas: The Camera Was Always Running” at the Jewish Museum is probably best savored in morsels rather than swallowed in one gulp of time. A selective retrospective instead of an exhaustive one, it deftly reintroduces—on the centenary of his birth—a singular figure who for more than 60 years was a guiding spirit of avant-garde cinema in New York and the world."
