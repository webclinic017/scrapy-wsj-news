    "body": "Russian police detained thousands of people protesting the war in Ukraine, as the Kremlin—which has banned  Facebook  and  Twitter  and shut down independent media—moved to silence any dissent against the military operations.<br />Thousands turned out in dozens of cities across the country. They were the largest demonstrations so far of the daily antiwar rallies that have taken place in Russia since President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24."
