    "body": "LOS ANGELES—The trial of Nebraska Rep. Jeff Fortenberry opened Thursday as jurors began considering charges that the Republican congressman lied to federal investigators in a bid to conceal illegal campaign contributions he received during a 2016 California fundraiser.<br />Prosecutors allege Mr. Fortenberry, who has served in Congress since 2005, later learned that Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire Gilbert Chagoury illegally funneled $30,000 in contributions to his reelection campaign through straw donors at the fundraiser. But during interviews with federal agents investigating alleged contributions by Mr. Chagoury to several U.S. political candidates, Mr. Fortenberry repeatedly denied knowledge of Mr. Chagoury’s involvement, prosecutors alleged."
