    "body": "Netflix  named many culprits for its lousy first quarter: a war in Ukraine, the world’s recovery from stay-at-home Covid, competition from new streamers, password sharing—nearly one-third of Netflix viewers apparently are stealing the service.<br />At the same time, paying customers appear to be disappearing at an accelerating rate. After losing 200,000 in the first quarter, Netflix expects to lose another two million in the second. No wonder the stock crashed—there’s no other word for it—down 35% on Wednesday, continuing a plunge that began in January and sparked a similar column here."
