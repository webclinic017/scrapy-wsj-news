    "body": "We’re old enough to remember a time—two years ago—when China’s aggressive Covid suppression was presented as a model for Western governments. No longer. While the rest of the world is emerging from pandemic restrictions, Shanghai is enduring a harsh new lockdown that could cost China and the rest of the world dearly.<br />Fearing that local officials were letting the virus spiral out of control, Beijing flew Covid fixer Sun Chunlan to China’s business capital this month to impose one of the most drastic lockdowns to date. Some 25 million people have been forced to stay at home with no warning and no time to stockpile food."
