    "body": "Jeff Bezos has very definitely not left the building.<br />Amazon . com’s famous founder formally handed over the chief-executive reins to successor Andy Jassy last July—just two weeks before hopping on board one of his Blue Origin rockets to take that company’s first manned flight into space. Mr. Jassy has had his hands full ever since, dealing with a postpandemic slowdown in Amazon’s e-commerce sales, continued scrutiny from lawmakers and, now, what looks like a successful unionization drive at one of the company’s distribution centers in New York City. Amazon’s shares are down 7% since Mr. Jassy’s first day on the job, lagging behind a 4% gain by the S&P 500 and an average 16% gain by tech-giant peers  Apple ,   Microsoft  and Google-parent  Alphabet  in that time."
