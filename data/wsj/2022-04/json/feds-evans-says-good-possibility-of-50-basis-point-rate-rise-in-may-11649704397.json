    "body": "Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said Monday an aggressive interest rate increase is a possibility at the U.S. central bank’s policy gathering in early May.<br />A 50 basis point rate rise at the May 3 and 4 Federal Open Market Committee meeting “is obviously worthy of consideration, perhaps it’s highly likely,” he said, as the Federal Reserve lifts its still very low federal-funds rate toward a neutral setting of between 2.25% and 2.50% by the end of the year."
