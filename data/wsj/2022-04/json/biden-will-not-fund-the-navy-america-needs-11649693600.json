    "body": "Regarding your editorial “The Shrinking U.S. Navy” (April 5): There is no excuse for the Biden administration’s repeated refusal to adequately fund the Navy. A bipartisan consensus now exists that, as a maritime nation with an immediate need to confront an adversarial China, the U.S. must pursue a blue-water strategy that necessitates a far bigger fleet.<br />The hard work to develop a fully funded 30-year shipbuilding plan to achieve a fleet of 400 manned ships within 20 years was done by the last administration. Our plan assumed a restrained defense top line to accommodate different planning scenarios in the years ahead. Thankfully, in President Biden’s first year, Congress stuck closely to it, overriding the administration’s 3% cut with the 14% increase we called for."
