    "body": "In March 1995, I stood at the edge of a southern Russian city, Grozny. The sky was dove blue with the promise of spring, but the air was thickly mingled with dust. High black columns of smoke rose from the center, and I could hear the occasional thump of artillery in the distance. The Russian army had just captured the city from Chechen rebels by means of total destruction, reducing high-rise apartment blocks to rubble. They called it a “liberation.”<br />People, many of them elderly Russian-speaking pensioners, began emerging from cellars. The world that they knew had been erased. A line of shabby buses was waiting to evacuate them from the city. Hours earlier I had visited a family holding a wake for an old Chechen man, a veteran of World War II, who lay in his front room with a red gash on his head. He had been knocked down and killed outside his house by an armored car driven by drunken soldiers."
