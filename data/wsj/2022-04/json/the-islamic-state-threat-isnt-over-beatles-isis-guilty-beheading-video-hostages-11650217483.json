    "body": "Some of the most searing images from the last decade were of Islamic State terrorists beheading hostages on video. Last week a jihadist associated with those captors was finally brought to justice and convicted in a federal court in Virginia. It’s a reminder that the war against ISIS isn’t over and may erupt again if the U.S. doesn’t stay on offense.<br />A jury found El Shafee Elsheikh guilty on four counts for his role in the hostage-taking and murder of Americans in Syria in 2012-2014. He is believed to be one of the so-called Beatles, or British ISIS members, who were especially vicious captors. The four alleged Beatles are believed to have  been killed or captured. Mr. Elsheikh was caught by America’s Kurdish allies in Syria in 2018 as he tried to flee to Turkey."
