    "body": "Regarding Stanley Goldfarb’s op-ed “Keep Politics Out of the Doctor’s Office” (April 19): As medical educators, we have a responsibility to teach future physicians to provide the best care for their patients. This means making sure students have the medical and scientific knowledge they need, including an understanding of environmental, social and economic factors that affect a patient’s health.<br />Our goal, and that of every medical school, is to recruit a diverse class of talented medical students in a holistic fashion and educate them to improve the health of their patients and communities. There is ample evidence that historically marginalized people who live in poverty, as well as members of LGBTQ communities, disproportionately experience poor health and inadequate access to quality care. These inequities are often rooted in systemic discrimination, including racism."
