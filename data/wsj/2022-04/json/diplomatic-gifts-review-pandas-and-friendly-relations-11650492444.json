    "body": "When Bhupinder Singh, an Indian maharaja, visited Berlin in 1935, he finagled his way into an audience with a reluctant Adolf Hitler. The two hit it off so well that a few formal minutes on the Führer’s calendar turned into lunch, with follow-up meetings over the next few days. At their final encounter, Hitler presented his new eastern friend with a dazzling Maybach DS-8 Zeppelin Cabriolet, a sleek convertible 18 feet long.<br />In “Diplomatic Gifts: A History of Fifty Presents,” Paul Brummell tells us that the bestowal on the maharaja of such a car was an attempt by Hitler to steer him away from the British, for whom he had actively recruited Sikh soldiers during World War I. The ploy was unsuccessful. Bhupinder died in 1938, still faithful to the Raj, and his son—mortified by the Nazi Maybach on the palace grounds—gave the car away."
