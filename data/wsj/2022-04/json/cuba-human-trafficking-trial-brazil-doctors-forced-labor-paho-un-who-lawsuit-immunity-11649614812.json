    "body": "In a victory for human rights, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia last month upheld the right of victims of a human-trafficking network to sue a subsidiary of the United Nations’ World Health Organization in a U.S. court. The decision is a warning to the U.N. to clean up its act.<br />The four Cuban doctors who filed the class-action suit against the Pan American Health Organization allege they became forced labor under a 2013-18 contract between Cuba and Brazil. The plaintiffs claim that PAHO acted as financial intermediary for the two parties, using its U.S. bank accounts to convert Brazilian reais to dollars and then move the money to the Cuban regime."
