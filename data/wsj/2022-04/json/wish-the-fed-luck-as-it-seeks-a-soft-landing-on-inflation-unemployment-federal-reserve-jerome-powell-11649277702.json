    "body": "Americans don’t agree on much these days, but there seems to be one thing we strongly agree on: Inflation is far too high. A recent Gallup poll found concern with inflation easily topping the list of the nation’s economic worries.<br />It also tops the Federal Reserve’s worry list, and Chairman Jerome Powell has pledged to “use our tools” to bring inflation down. “Use our tools” in this context is a euphemism for raising interest rates. But what, specifically, is the Fed trying to accomplish with higher rates? And are its tools enough to do the job?"
