    "body": "Thomas Piketty is back. The French economist is best known for “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” (2013), an 800-page book turbid with equations and numbers of all kinds. Especially memorable to fellow economists is its signature formula, r > g—which holds that the rate of return on private capital will always exceed an economy’s growth rate. In Mr. Piketty’s view, this is “the central contradiction of capitalism,” which locks society into an “endless inegalitarian spiral.”<br />The book was one of the more improbable successes in the history of bookselling: 2.5 million copies were bought. Although impenetrable to anyone without a doctorate in economics, it came to be regarded as a game-changing weapon in the war to wrest wealth from the rich. And so the book turned into a totem for Western progressives. Yet surveys have shown that few who bought it read it, making it a challenger to Stephen Hawking’s “A Brief History of Time” for the most unread book in history."
