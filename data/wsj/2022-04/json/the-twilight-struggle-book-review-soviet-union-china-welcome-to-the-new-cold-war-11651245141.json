    "body": "The Cold War strategist George Kennan, in his “Memoirs” (1967), tells how he once escorted a group of drunken congressmen to meet the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. The year was 1945, and Kennan was charge d’affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. The congressmen had traveled to Moscow in hopes of seeing the reclusive dictator, who agreed to meet the delegation but not before having the NKVD ply them with large quantities of tea spiked with vodka. Moments before arriving at the Kremlin, one congressman, feeling the vodka, shouted that he planned to “biff the old codger one in the nose.” Faced with every embassy handler’s worst nightmare, the normally shy Kennan erupted and told the congressman, in effect, to shut up.<br />This episode, which occurred not long before Kennan composed his famous “Long Telegram” warning against Soviet expansionism, reveals a lot about the great strategist’s relationship with power. Brilliant, moody and introverted, Kennan was not the type to tell the establishment what it wanted to hear. For years he waged a kind of one-man campaign, first against utopians in the Roosevelt administration who thought they could sweet-talk “Uncle Joe,” then against hawks in the early Truman administration who wanted to biff Stalin one in the nose."
