    "body": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday sent a bus load of undocumented immigrants to Washington, D.C, to protest President Biden’s border policies. Fine if he wants to poke lawmakers to control illegal migration, but why is he also punishing Americans by obstructing legal commerce?<br />Last week Mr. Abbott directed state troopers to inspect trucks crossing his state’s southern border for human trafficking, weapons and drugs. He was responding to the Administration’s coming withdrawal of Title 42, a pandemic policy that has allowed the feds to expel undocumented immigrants, including asylum claimants apprehended at the border."
