    "body": "If the Biden administration is so eager to forgive student debt (“Student-Loan Reparations,” Review & Outlook, April 22), then it should be the policy of the next Republican administration to eliminate permanently all federal sources of college financing. If the government can’t be trusted to enforce its contract with student borrowers on behalf of taxpayers, it shouldn’t enter into the contract at all.<br />Ceasing to shower money on anyone who wants to go college would increase the value of a college education. It would also focus the minds of college administrators on delivering a real education at a reasonable cost."
