    "body": "Agriculture companies are reaping big gains as the war in Ukraine tightens the global supply of crops, and consumers’ food demand stays strong despite higher prices.<br />Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has disrupted supplies from one of the world’s top grain-exporting regions, pushing up prices for wheat and corn. Bad weather afflicting other big crop-producing countries, including in South America, is also fueling the supply crunch. Meanwhile, demand remains robust for food, livestock feed and fuel made from grains, industry executives said."
