    "body": "A few years ago, Elon Musk said at an industry conference he believed we are likely living in some sort of a videogame simulation. If he is right, he has willed it so.<br />As if the marijuana and boob references on  Twitter  weren’t enough, an Elvis Presley reference on Twitter over the weekend should have been proof Mr. Musk is holding the controller. The tweet, “Love Me Tender,” sent around noon Saturday, could easily have meant Mr. Musk spent a weekend afternoon relaxing to some oldies after a whirlwind week. Or, as a sea of press reported Sunday, it could mean the world’s richest person is preparing a tender offer for what he calls the world’s “de facto town square.”"
