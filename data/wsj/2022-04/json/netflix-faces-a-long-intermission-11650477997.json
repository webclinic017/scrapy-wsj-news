    "body": "Markets once punished  Netflix  for being too ahead of the curve. Falling behind is now incurring a similar penalty.<br />The streaming giant’s stock price crashed 35% Wednesday following disappointing first-quarter results that included the company’s first drop in paid subscribers in more than a decade. That represents the stock’s largest single-day selloff in nearly 18 years, according to FactSet. Netflix has also now shed about 67% of its market value from the stock’s peak in mid-November, mirroring the selloff that ensued as part of the infamous Qwikster debacle in 2011 when Netflix announced plans to separate its streaming service from a renamed DVD-by-mail service. That plan ultimately resulted in Netflix losing about 78% of its market value before the company called off the move late that year."
