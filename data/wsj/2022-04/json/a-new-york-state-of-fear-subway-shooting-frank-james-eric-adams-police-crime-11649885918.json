    "body": "New Yorkers breathed easier Wednesday after police arrested Frank James, the suspect in Tuesday’s rush-hour shooting in the city’s subway. But not all that much easier. The shooting shocked New Yorkers because it happened in the city’s central nervous system—and because it symbolizes the larger and steep decline in law and order.<br />Mr. James, whose YouTube videos suggest he is furious at the world and perhaps mentally ill, allegedly set off a smoke bomb in a subway car and shot and wounded 10 people. It’s a miracle no one was killed. Subway cameras failed, and Mr. James eluded police for 30 hours before he was arrested walking in Manhattan. Police said he will be charged with committing a terrorist act."
