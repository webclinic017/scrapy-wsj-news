    "body": "The Biden administration’s plan to temporarily allow higher ethanol blends in gasoline is set to boost U.S. ethanol producers like  Archer Daniels Midland Co . ,  Green Plains Inc .  and Poet LLC, while lifting demand for farmers’ corn, agriculture industry executives and analysts said.<br />The Biden administration said that increasing use of gasoline with 15% ethanol, known as E15, over the summer months would help lower consumers’ fuel costs, which have climbed following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The decision is seen as a win for corn growers and ethanol-producing companies, though some groups said they fear it could further inflate food prices by making grain more expensive."
