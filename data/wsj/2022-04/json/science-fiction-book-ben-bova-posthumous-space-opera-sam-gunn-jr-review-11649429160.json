    "body": "No one has done more to keep the dream of space alive in science fiction than Ben Bova (1932-2020). In a career spanning 60 years, as author, editor and anthologist, he kept his eyes firmly focused on the future of development in the solar system. His later years were devoted to a “Grand Tour” cycle of more than 20 novels, imagining the future of the planets from Mercury to Neptune to Uranus.<br />Bova’s “Sam Gunn Jr.,” published posthumously, relates an individual “Grand Tour.” Sam Gunn Jr. is the son of one of Bova’s earlier heroes, but he only finds out the truth through a death-bed confession from his mother. Genetic testing will establish who he is, but only if he can reach his father on the Moon, so their DNA can be compared."
