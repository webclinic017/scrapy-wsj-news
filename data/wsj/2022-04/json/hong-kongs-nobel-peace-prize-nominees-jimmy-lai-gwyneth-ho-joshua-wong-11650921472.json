    "body": "Hong Kong dissidents continue to languish in prison, and Beijing hopes the world forgets. So it’s welcome news that more than a dozen academics in 10 countries have nominated five of the city’s most prominent democracy advocates for the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize.<br />The nominees include our friend Jimmy Lai, founder of Apple Daily, and Gwyneth Ho, a former reporter for Stand News. Police have forced the closures of both publications, seized their assets without due process, and imprisoned some of their staff. The Nobel nominees also include Lee Cheuk-yan and Chow Hang-tung, who helped organize Hong Kong’s annual vigil for victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre; and Joshua Wong, who first drew Beijing’s ire as a teen leader of the 2014 Umbrella Movement."
