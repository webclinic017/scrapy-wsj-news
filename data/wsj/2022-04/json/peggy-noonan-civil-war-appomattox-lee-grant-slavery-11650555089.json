    "body": "Regarding Peggy Noonan’s “America’s Most Tumultuous Holy Week” (Declarations, April 16): I was touched by the respect shown by Union officers as they stood in unison and saluted Gen. Robert E. Lee at Appomattox. I was touched also by Lee’s message to his troops: “Leave the result to God. Go to your homes and resume your occupations. Obey the laws and become as good citizens as you were soldiers.”<br />The magnanimity in victory displayed by President Abraham Lincoln and Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, and the conciliatory attitude adopted by Lee, are a testament to the three men’s character and love of country. At the most divisive time in our history, their thought was how to heal the nation’s wounds."
