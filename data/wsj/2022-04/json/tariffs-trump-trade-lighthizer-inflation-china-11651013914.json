    "body": "Regarding your editorial “Cut Tariffs to Help Inflation and Ukraine” (April 18): First, President Trump’s tariffs on China were put in place as a result of a rigorous legal process and are designed to counter serious unfair and predatory practices. The U.S. is being threatened in the economic sphere by a dangerous and increasingly aggressive adversary. Rolling back the tariffs would essentially give the adversary a pass to cheat and cost many Americans their jobs. The China challenge is more important to the long-term prosperity and security of our country than the current inflation.<br />Second, the notion that these tariffs are inflationary, regardless of the economic benefit from challenging Chinese behavior, is questionable at best. The tariffs were in place for two years during the Trump administration and there was no significant inflation. I know that economists have their concocted models but that is the reality."
