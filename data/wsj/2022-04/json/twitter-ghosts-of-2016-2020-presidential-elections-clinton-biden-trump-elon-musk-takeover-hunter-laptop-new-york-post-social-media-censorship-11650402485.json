    "body": "The law of scarcity applies to Elon Musk. Whatever his paper wealth, he is as impoverished as the rest of us in the time and attention he can devote to his many interests, which is one reason his  Twitter  bid is likely to fizzle out.<br />I can think of others. Mr. Musk is not the naïf he finds it useful to play. He knows, for business reasons as well as political reasons, that Twitter has crossed the river of no return in “moderating” the content that appears on its service—it can’t allow untrammeled free expression."
