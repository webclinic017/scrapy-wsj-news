    "body": "Michael Cimino was supposed to be The Next Guy. Emerging in the late 1960s as an award-winning director of television commercials, he moved to Los Angeles at the apex of the New Hollywood era, knocked around for a bit, then made “The Deer Hunter” (1978)—his sweeping saga of a Pennsylvania steel-town community torn apart by the Vietnam War. The movie was a hit, winning Cimino the Oscar for best director. Then, less than two years later, it all came crashing down.<br />Charles Elton’s assiduously researched and fascinating “Cimino: ‘The Deer Hunter,’ ‘Heaven’s Gate,’ and the Price of a Vision” is the first full-length biography of the filmmaker, a maximalist master of overstatement for whom no budget was too large. It’s no surprise to read that the director, who died in 2016 at the age of 77, was keen to adapt Ayn Rand’s “The Fountainhead”: Like Rand’s protagonist, Howard Roark, Cimino would rather have destroyed his creations than settle for mediocrity. Ultimately, by alienating almost everyone in Hollywood with his absolute refusal to compromise, Cimino blew himself up."
