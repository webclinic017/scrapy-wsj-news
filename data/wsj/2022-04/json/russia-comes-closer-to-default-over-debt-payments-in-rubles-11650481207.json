    "body": "Russia is inching closer to a default on its sovereign debts after an industry body overseeing the credit-default swaps market ruled Wednesday that the Kremlin failed to meet its obligations to foreign creditors when it paid them with rubles earlier this month.<br />Russia paid bondholders in rubles on April 6 after the U.S. blocked Russia from using American banks to channel payments on its dollar-denominated bonds. The Russian Ministry of Finance said it had attempted to remit dollar interest payments due to bondholders through  JPMorgan Chase  & Co., but the bank declined to process some $649 million in payments because the U.S. Treasury didnâ€™t grant approval."
