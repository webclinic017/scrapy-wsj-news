    "body": "Judging by their buyback promises,  UBS ,  the billionaireâ€™s bank, is more confident about weathering the year ahead than  HSBC ,  its Asia-focused rival.<br />The Swiss wealth manager had its best first quarter since 2007, and on Monday nudged up 2022 buyback expectations to the top of its range. HSBC took a more muted line: It will follow through on earlier buyback promises, but warned that more were unlikely this year. It is shaping up to be a mixed quarter for European banks, as was the case for their U.S. peers."
