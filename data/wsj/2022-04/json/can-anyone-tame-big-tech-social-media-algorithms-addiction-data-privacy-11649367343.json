    "body": "Journalists and people who think aloud for a living are often invited to gatherings where experts in various fields share what they know. These meetings often operate under Chatham House rules, in which you can write of the ideas presented but not directly quote speakers. At such a gathering this week I was especially struck by the talks on Big Tech, and since Congress is considering various regulatory bills I want to say what I gleaned.<br />First and most obviously, nobody understands the million current aspects of social media sites. They raise questions ranging from the political (misinformation, disinformation, deliberate polarization, ideological bias) and the technological (hidden data harvesting) to the legal (antitrust law, First Amendment rights) and the moral and ethical (deliberately addicting users, the routine acquisition and selling of private information, pornography). Itâ€™s all so big and complex. Mark Zuckerberg, who invented the social-media world we live in, appears to have thrown in the towel and fled to the metaverse, where things will no doubt become even more complex and bizarre. But what he calls a visionary next step looks very much like an escape attempt."
