    "body": "Angela Phillips grew up in Ohio and has run a family-owned manufacturing business there since 2009. In 2018 she was looking to expand the firm and, given her years of experience with labor unions, believed it made sense to grow in a right-to-work state. So in 2020 she opened a Phillips Tube Group plant right across the border in Richmond, Ind., which now employs more than 25 people.<br />Phillips Tube isnâ€™t alone in crossing state lines to benefit from a right-to-work law, which frees employees from being forced to belong or pay dues to a union. We recently published a national study on the impact of these laws between bordering states, using data from more than 3,000 U.S. counties in 18 industrial sectors and in two distinct time periods."
