    "body": "Falling unemployment is usually something to cheer for. Right now, though, the lower the unemployment rate goes, the more fraught the Federal Reserve’s efforts to cool the economy could become.<br />The unemployment rate is already very low—the Labor Department on Friday reported that last month it slipped to 3.6% from 3.8% a month earlier, bringing it close to the 50-year nadir of 3.5% it registered in February 2020, right before the pandemic hit. And it could easily go even lower in the months ahead, perhaps significantly so."
