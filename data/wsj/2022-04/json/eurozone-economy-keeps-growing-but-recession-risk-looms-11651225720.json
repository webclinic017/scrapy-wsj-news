    "body": "The eurozone’s economy continued to grow at a modest pace in the first three months of the year, but faces the threat of a slide into recession as Russia’s war on Ukraine keeps energy costs high and squeezes household spending power.<br />Restrictions intended to contain the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 weighed on activity at the start of the year. That burden eased as the quarter progressed and the eurozone economy appeared set for a strong recovery this year."
