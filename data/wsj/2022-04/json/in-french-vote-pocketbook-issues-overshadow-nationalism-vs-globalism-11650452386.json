    "body": "France’s presidential election in 2017 was a watershed for Western politics, fought not along the traditional lines of left and right but over national identity, immigration and international institutions such as Europe’s common currency, the euro. It pitted “patriots” against “globalists,” as National Front candidate Marine Le Pen put it, or “closed” against “open,” in the words of centrist Emmanuel Macron.<br />The globalists won that round, with Mr. Macron trouncing Ms. Le Pen by 32 percentage points. The rematch is Sunday, and the outcome looks much closer, with polls putting Mr. Macron’s lead at single digits."
