    "body": "After this past year, and after reading Karl Rove’s op-ed “Biden’s Gaffes Grate on Voters” (March 31), it is easy to see why President Biden doesn’t take questions on a regular basis. We were told during his campaign that “the words of a president matter.” Here we are, a couple of years later, and Mr. Biden is even walking that back.<br />Americans are supposed to pretend that we didn’t hear the things Mr. Biden said in regard to a regime change in Russia and troops being deployed to Ukraine. Instead of asking the president tough questions about this, many in the mainstream media get mad at Fox News’s White House correspondent, Peter Doocy, for asking the president about his own words."
