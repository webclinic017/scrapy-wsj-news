    "body": "Elon Musk has said he wants to run  Twitter  because of its importance as a free speech “town square” and not to make money, but the deal he just signed requires him to make money, and that’s fine.<br />The lenders, at least, will want their $25.5 billion share of the $44 billion purchase price back, some of it secured by  Tesla  stock. Mr. Musk’s own finances will be in a world of hurt if his Twitter turnaround fails and simultaneously the helium comes out of Tesla’s stock price. So financial realities will work to corral his impulses to some extent. He won’t be ending Twitter’s reliance on advertising, which accounts for 90% of revenue. He won’t be junking the “content moderation” needed to keep advertisers from fleeing."
