    "body": "I disagree with David Bernstein’s “Teach ‘1619’ and ‘1776’ U.S. History” (op-ed, April 11). I am a middle-school U.S.-history teacher, well aware of the difficulties of teaching history to a generation with little consciousness of or interest in the past. But by addressing the issues of critical race theory, you give them legitimacy. Forget the “issues,” just teach the history.<br />Our kids need to be taught who the early settlers were, what their challenges were, their problems with Native Americans, the difference between Virginia and Boston, religious issues, the creation of a practical currency and formation of a government, the changing face of slavery, the French and Indian War, the Founding Fathers—all the stuff that makes up U.S. history. What happened? Why one way and not another?"
