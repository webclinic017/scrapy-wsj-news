    "body": "My discussions in recent days with Arabs—high government officials, prominent businessmen and former diplomats—underscore the gap between how the Ukraine war is commonly viewed in the Middle East and here in America.<br />For many in the U.S., the shock of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has given way to outrage as every day brings stories of torture, rape and brutality more chilling and gruesome than the stories of the day before. In the face of Russia’s aggression, Americans believe they are on the right side of history by standing firmly in support of brave Ukrainians defending their homeland."
