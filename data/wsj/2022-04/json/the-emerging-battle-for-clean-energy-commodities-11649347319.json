    "body": "For much of the 20th century, geopolitics was shaped by the struggle for oil. Now it’s becoming ever more clear that geopolitics in the 21st century will be shaped by the struggle to move away from oil.<br />This transition was bound to happen anyway because of concerns about climate change, but Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, by revealing the perils of Western dependence on Russian oil and gas, now figures to kick it into overdrive. In the short run, these shifts mostly involve creating new patterns for moving old-fashioned fossil fuels around the planet and even for extracting more of them during this crisis."
