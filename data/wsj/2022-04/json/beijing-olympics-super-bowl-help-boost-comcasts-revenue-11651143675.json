    "body": "Comcast Corp.  said the number of paying subscribers to its Peacock streaming service jumped by more than 40% in the first quarter, thanks in part to a jam-packed February of top sporting events, which included the Super Bowl and Beijing Winter Olympics.<br />The performance of Peacock, which has been slow to gain traction since its launch less than two years ago, comes as the streaming industry’s leader,  Netflix Inc.,  last week said it had lost subscribers for the first time in more than a decade. Netflix’s decline highlighted the challenges that newer entrants in the streaming field are likely to face growing their customer base while competing with a much larger field of rivals."
