    "body": "Lululemon ’s  roots are grounded in yoga, but it is stretching well beyond that now.<br />The athletic-apparel company said in an analyst presentation this past Wednesday that it aims to double its sales from $6.3 billion in its latest fiscal year to $12.5 billion by 2026. As ambitious as that seems, it may not be too far out of reach for Lululemon, which has doubled its revenue in three years. Analysts polled by FactSet were already penciling in a similar number."
