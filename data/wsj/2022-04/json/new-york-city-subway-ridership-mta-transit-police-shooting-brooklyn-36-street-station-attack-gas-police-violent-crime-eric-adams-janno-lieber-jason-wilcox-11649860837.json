    "body": "New York<br />The subway system—lifeblood of this city’s economy and vitality—is in a precarious condition. Weekday ridership has hovered below 60% of pre-pandemic levels. Violent crime has risen in raw numbers even with the dramatic drop-off of riders. The perception and reality of danger loom large. A survey last month of the city’s workforce found that nearly 3 in 4 feel less safe on trains than they did two years ago. Transit officials say riders who never returned to the subways are even more terrified of crime underground."
