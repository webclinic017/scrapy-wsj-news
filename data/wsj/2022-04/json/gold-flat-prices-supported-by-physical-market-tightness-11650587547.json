    "body": "0730 GMT - Gold futures in New York are moving higher in early trading to $1,954 a troy ounce, up 0.3%, after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank might increase interest rates by half a percentage point in May. The hawkish comments come against a tide of inflation and other economic growth worries, helping to push investors toward gold. “Bullion provides a good hedge against hyperinflation, which creates risks to holding traditional assets. Still, with stagflation moving from a potential tail risk to reality, investors worldwide are turning to gold as a keen portfolio diversifier,” Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, says in a note.
