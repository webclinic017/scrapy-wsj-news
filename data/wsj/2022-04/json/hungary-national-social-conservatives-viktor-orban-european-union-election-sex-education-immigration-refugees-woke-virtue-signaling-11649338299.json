    "body": "One of the stranger phenomena of the age is that a certain kind of conservative now holds out Hungary as the model of Christian governance to which the West should aspire. This explains why this week you’ve read more than you ever wanted to about last Sunday’s re-election of Viktor Orbán as prime minister of the small and dysfunctional European state.<br />The case for Orbánism is that Mr. Orbán fights. His international reputation and some of his domestic success are built on a string of fierce political conflicts with European Union grandees in Brussels and across the bloc’s other member countries."
