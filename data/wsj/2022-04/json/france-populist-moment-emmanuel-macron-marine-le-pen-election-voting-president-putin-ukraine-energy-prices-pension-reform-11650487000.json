    "body": "Paris<br />Give the French electorate credit for consistency. In 2017 Emmanuel Macron easily won the presidency over the nationalist Marine Le Pen. Since then plenty of politicians—from insurgent outsiders to the establishment’s upper crust—auditioned for the role of chief rival to the heterodox but centrist president. Yet Sunday’s presidential election will be a rematch of five years ago, as most every poll since 2017 has suggested. While a Le Pen victory appears even less likely than Brexit or Donald Trump’s rise, the consequences could be just as profound and are worth keeping in mind."
