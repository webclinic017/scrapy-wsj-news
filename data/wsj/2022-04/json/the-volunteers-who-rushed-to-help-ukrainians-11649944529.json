    "body": "I’m not sure what gave me the idea. It might have been a news story about people volunteering to fight in Ukraine or driving to the border to pick up refugees. But once the seed was planted, there was little question in my mind. For reasons I’m still not sure I understand, I had to put my life in Washington, D.C., on hold and go to Poland. I had to try to help.<br />It wasn’t easy to find a spot to volunteer, somewhere I could be useful. But now that I’ve made it to Krakow, I’m discovering a world of other people like me—international volunteers and Poles from all walks of life who feel compelled to pitch in where they can."
