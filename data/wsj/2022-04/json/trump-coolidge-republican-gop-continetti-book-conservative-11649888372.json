    "body": "Matthew Continetti is correct to say it is hard to think of two U.S. presidents with less in common than Calvin Coolidge and Donald Trump (“The Return of the Old American Right,” Review, April 9). Coolidge was a man of the highest moral standards who defended the rule of law. He was a humble public servant who treated everyone with the utmost respect.<br />There’s no comparison between the GOP’s Trump wing and the conservatives of the 1920s. Coolidge believed in good government. He was honest above all. He improved public education and cut taxes, broadening economic prosperity and lifting the standard of living for the masses, all while delivering budget surpluses."
