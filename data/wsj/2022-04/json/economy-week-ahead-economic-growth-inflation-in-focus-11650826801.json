    "body": "U.S. and eurozone reports on first-quarter gross domestic product will show how both economies performed during a period marked by sharp rises and rapid falls in Covid-19 cases, surging inflation and the start of Russia’s attack on Ukraine.’<br />U.S. factories have been caught between strong demand and stretched supply chains during the Covid-19 recovery.
