    "body": "Procter & Gamble Co.  posted its biggest quarterly sales gain in at least two decades as consumers, undeterred by inflation and the threat of a recession, paid more for household mainstays including Pampers diapers and Gillette razors.<br />The Cincinnati consumer-products company said organic sales rose 10% for the quarter ended March 31, the biggest jump since P&G started tracking the metric 20 years ago. Organic sales is a closely watched figure that strips out deals and currency moves."
