    "body": "Faith Bottum writes of a few reasons to commend a stick shift (“The Dying Art of Driving a Stick Shift,” op-ed, March 28), such as lower cost and less theft, largely because there are few people left in North America who know how to operate one. I would emphasize the pure joy of the human-machine interface, where driver and vehicle become one. There is a magic and satisfaction with a perfect shift.<br />On the other side of the automatic transmission lies the next step in the evolution to complete passivity: the driverless vehicle. I worry that we are becoming entranced by the screen, and losing the capacity to be physically engaged with the world. The stick allows that, for the vehicle is useless absent a human exerting his or her will upon its heft. I will not relinquish that affirmative command for as long as I am able."
