    "body": "No President has been more hostile to charters schools than Joe Biden, and his Department of Education is proving it with proposed rules that undermine the federal Charter Schools Program. The assault is triggering a bipartisan political backlash.<br />In an April 6 letter to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, six Republican Senators led by North Carolina’s Richard Burr note that Congress rejected a proposal that makes it harder for charters to tap the federal program. “Such blatant disregard is yet another example of this Administration ignoring the will of Congress and acting by executive fiat,” the Senators write. They say the department has refused to meet with Mr. Burr’s staff."
