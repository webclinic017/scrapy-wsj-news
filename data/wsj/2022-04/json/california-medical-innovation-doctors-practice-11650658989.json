    "body": "Allysia Finley’s op-ed “California’s Medical ‘Misinformation’ Crusade Could Cost Lives” (April 21) is entirely correct. Respect for patient autonomy is one of the pillars of principle-based medical ethics, and it is considered by many as the most significant because of the value placed in modern Western society on individualism and liberty. Aren’t patients allowed to choose doctors with different opinions?<br />Medical science is ever changing. Today’s contrarian concepts often are tomorrow’s standards of care. Ignaz Semmelweis, the Hungarian obstetrician who introduced hand washing into medical practice, was ostracized. I wrote against such one-size-fits-all approaches as the 39-week rule in obstetrics. Years later, the rule was found to increase stillbirths and other fetal and maternal morbidities."
