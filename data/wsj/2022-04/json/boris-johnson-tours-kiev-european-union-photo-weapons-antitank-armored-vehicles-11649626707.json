    "body": "Boris Johnson may have messed up British energy policy, but the Prime Minister has been stalwart in support of Ukraine against Russia. His latest effort was a personal trip to Kiev to visit President Volodymyr Zelensky on the weekend, including a one-on-one meeting and a stroll through the streets.<br />Call it a photo-op if you like, but this one matters. Ukraine has won the battle of Kiev, which Mr. Johnson called “the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century.” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also visited Kiev and offered a fast-track to European Union membership."
