    "body": "Regarding Toni Nissi’s op-ed “There’s Hope for a More Peaceful Lebanon” (April 24): Mr. Nissi asks whether Lebanese can expect greater U.S. assistance if they increase their opposition to Hezbollah, Iran’s terrorist proxy dominating their country’s politics. The answer should be yes. U.S. foreign assistance now flows to Lebanon’s Hezbollah-controlled national government and to infrastructure projects in Hezbollah strongholds. It would serve American interests to reallocate it in ways that counter Iran’s influence.<br />Lebanon’s politics, including its upcoming parliamentary elections, are in Hezbollah’s grip. If the U.S. is going to provide aid to Lebanon, it makes more sense to direct it away from national and municipal authorities, which are under Hezbollah’s influence, and toward private groups that promote healthy political principles and peace with Lebanon’s neighbors."
