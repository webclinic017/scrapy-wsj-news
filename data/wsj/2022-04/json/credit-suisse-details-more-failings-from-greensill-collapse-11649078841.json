    "body": "Credit Suisse  Group AG gave new details Monday on how it was caught out by the collapse of Greensill Capital in March 2021 and why it overlooked earlier red flags.<br />Credit Suisse said an internal review found that the reputational damage and economic failure from Greensill could have been averted if individual managers and employees had conducted themselves “more appropriately.” It fired 10 people, and is clawing back $43 million in pay. The bank had already said it would restructure its asset management arm."
