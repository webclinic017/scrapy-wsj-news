    "body": "In “Learning the Wrong Investing Lessons” (Exchange, March 26), Jason Zweig worries that K-12 students are taught bad investing habits by stock-picking games, in which the goal is to make the most money over several months. This confuses what motivates the game with what students learn.<br />These simulations help students learn what a company is, what a stock is, how shareholders own companies, how markets work, how stock prices respond to real-world events, what companies do with profits, why investing entails risk, how to assess risk, how to evaluate a company’s fundamentals and more. In short, seeing from the perspective of an investor or producer, rather than a rule follower or consumer. Even the charge that the games are too short ignores that the alternative is to use even shorter lesson plans."
