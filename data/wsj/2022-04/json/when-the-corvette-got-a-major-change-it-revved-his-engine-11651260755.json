    "body": "Richard Hagenlock, 68, a retired paint-company executive who lives in Santa Ana, Calif., on his 2021 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray C8, as told to A.J. Baime.<br />I was born and raised in South Dakota, in a town of some 1,500 people. My father owned an automotive repair shop, and I worked there all the time. We did everything: automotive mechanics, diesel mechanics, we fixed tractors, we had a small body shop. And we had a little area to keep a car to work on, when we weren’t working. That’s how I got into cars."
