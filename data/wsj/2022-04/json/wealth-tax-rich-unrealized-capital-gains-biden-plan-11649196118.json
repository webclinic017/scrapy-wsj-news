    "body": "Put aside the constitutional questions. Jason Furman’s support for a wealth tax on unrealized appreciation (“Biden’s Better Plan to Tax the Rich,” op-ed, March 29) is based significantly on a market-liquidity argument, fairly identifying that an estate basis step-up creates large incentives to hold stocks longer than many investors otherwise would.<br />The Biden plan would enhance liquidity, however, through widespread forced liquidations, with harsh economic consequences, including clear downward market pressure from selloffs to fund taxes. Perhaps most significant would be the deterrence to invest in startups and private companies without liquid or, often, any traded market, leading to many fire-sale exits—potentially devastating to companies and investors alike. Even orderly liquidations over the proposed five-year window could leave some founders and investors with negative net worth should a catastrophic event occur to their companies after accrued tax liabilities, or where margin loans to fund taxes become due on highly devalued assets."
