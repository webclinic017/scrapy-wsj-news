    "body": "Is President Biden a closet immigration restrictionist? It seems implausible given his campaign rhetoric, but then his border policies in practice are doing more for the restrictionist cause than Donald Trump or his former aide Stephen Miller.<br />The latest fiasco is his decision to rescind a Trump-era policy known as Title 42 on May 23. The law lets the federal government deport border crossers who claim asylum during a public-health emergency. Since March 2020 some two million migrants have been turned away under Title 42 authority, and President Biden has no backup plan."
