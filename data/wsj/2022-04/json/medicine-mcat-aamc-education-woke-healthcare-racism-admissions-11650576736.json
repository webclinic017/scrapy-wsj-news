    "body": "Regarding Stanley Goldfarb’s op-ed “Keep Politics Out of the Doctor’s Office” (April 19): In 2015, under the leadership of Darrell Kirch, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) introduced sweeping changes to the Medical College Admissions Test, or MCAT, as well as other admissions criteria used by medical schools across the country. As Dr. Kirch explained in 2011, “I am a man on a mission. I believe it is critical to our future to transform health care. I’m not talking about tweaking it. I’m not talking about some nuanced improvements here and there. I’m talking about true transformation.”<br />The transformation is underway. It is a subversive effort to change the personnel entering the medical field. The revised MCAT includes a new section that screens for adherence to progressive orthodoxies; for example, a practice question from a 2018 AAMC/Khan Academy offering asks whether the “lack of minorities such as African Americans or Latinos/Latinas among university faculty members” is due to symbolic racism, institutional racism, hidden racism or personal bias. The answer is supposed to be institutional racism."
