    "body": "More factories in and around Shanghai, including two run by an  Apple Inc.  supplier, are halting production because of extended Covid-19 lockdowns in the region, adding to pressure on the global supply chain.<br />Analysts said Shanghai-area manufacturers were having more trouble getting parts delivered because China’s restrictions on movement are making it difficult for trucks to enter the region. That means some factories can’t operate normally even if they manage to keep workers on the job."
