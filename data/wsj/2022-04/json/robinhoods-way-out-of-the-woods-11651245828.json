    "body": "Short selling hasn’t been much help to  Robinhood  Markets’ beleaguered share price. But it could be one key for the company to find some much-needed revenue growth.<br />Even as the stock languishes, down more than 40% so far in 2022, Robinhood is busy launching new products. So far this year it has introduced a new debit card and extended its trading hours. It has also completed the rollout of its cryptocurrency wallet and listed the popular Shiba Inu coin while jump-starting its overseas expansion by announcing the acquisition of a U.K. crypto app."
