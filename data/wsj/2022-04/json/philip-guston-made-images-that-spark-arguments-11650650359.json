    "body": "In 1970, Philip Guston enjoyed a reputation as a top-tier, financially successful abstract artist. Then, at a New York gallery, he showed his new work, full of comic-strip-like figures, lightbulbs, clocks, gloved hands seemingly inspired by Mickey Mouse and sinister hooded heads that evoked the Ku Klux Klan. Many art critics and friends of Guston reacted in horror, seeing him as a traitor to abstract art. One of his closest friendships, with the composer Morton Feldman, never recovered before Guston’s death in 1980, at the age of 66.<br />“Philip Guston Now,” opening May 1 at Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts, makes the case for the artist’s late figurative paintings as some of his most powerful creations. The 100-piece exhibition, which will travel in different iterations to Houston, Washington, D.C., and London, also shows that Guston’s controversial turn was less of a break than it initially appeared, allowing viewers to see how his late work evolved from earlier phases in his career."
