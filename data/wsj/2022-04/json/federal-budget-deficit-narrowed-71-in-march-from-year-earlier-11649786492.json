    "body": "The federal budget ran a $193 billion deficit during March, a 71% decline from a year earlier, as the government took in more in tax and other revenue while spending edged lower despite higher interest costs on the public debt.<br />Federal outlays in March fell by 45% to $508 billion, the Treasury Department reported Tuesday, reflecting a sharp decline in pandemic-related spending. Government receipts for the month rose by 18% from a year earlier to $315 billion, not adjusting for calendar differences, the Treasury said."
