    "body": "The Oishii strawberry looks like any other, but its grower describes the taste as “an amazing experience.” Is it worth about $6 a berry? Plenty of shoppers think so.<br />So much for Granny Smith. Grocery stores are stocking produce departments with pricey, hard-to-find fruits that promise to taste and look better than their humbler cousins. Branded items like Cotton Candy grapes, Pink-A-Boo Pineberries, Oishii strawberries and Sumo Citrus mandarins, often made by one or a handful of producers, let buyers feel like they’re onto something special."
