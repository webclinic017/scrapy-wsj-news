    "body": "While it is true that with federal Pell grants, colleges “have no incentive to improve graduation rates because the subsidies flow no matter how students fare” (“The Biden Plan to Raise College Tuition,” Review & Outlook, March 30), state governments have increasingly tried to make public colleges and universities more accountable for student outcomes through performance-based funding formulas.<br />A recent study from the Education Trust found that 33 states appropriated funding for public institutions under such formulas, most of which include degree completion as a metric. While not as effective as they could be, performance-based funding formulas can be improved, and they at least make public institutions have “skin in the game,” long championed by former Sen. Lamar Alexander."
