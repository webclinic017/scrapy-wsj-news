    "body": "An active-duty Marine Corps major writes in a letter that the Marine Corps demands extreme deference to authority, rewards conformity and punishes candor (March 31). That is not the Marine Corps I knew. We were given a mission and were expected to carry it out. That required initiative and the ability to make changes on the ground to accomplish the mission. Every Marine is a rifleman, and small-unit tactics are the lifeblood of Marine Corps units.<br />Not all recommendations, however, are accepted. One piece of trivia: My last duty station was with a reserve engineer company in Lincoln, Neb., in the late 1960s. I sent a recommendation to Marine Corps headquarters that we should have a desalination unit in case we ever needed it. The response was something to the effect of: Don’t worry, we will never be fighting in a desert."
