    "body": "Inflation and rising energy prices are roiling democratic politics around the world, and Britain is a prime example. But while the rest of Europe is getting serious about energy policy in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is drifting further into the clouds.<br />British households and businesses are in the grip of an energy-price emergency mostly of London’s making. Households saw the regulatory price cap for their electricity and natural gas rise 54% on April 1, and price hikes for commercial premises and industries have been even steeper. Partly this is due to rapidly rising global natural-gas prices, which have bankrupted some retail energy suppliers. But green-energy levies and subsidies, and Britain’s consumption tax or VAT, play an outsize role."
