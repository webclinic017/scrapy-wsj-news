    "body": "Be grateful for small favors: China’s dismal economic growth in the first three months of the year at least exceeded the more pessimistic predictions of economists. That’s the end of the good news, though, as Monday’s report of first-quarter GDP growth of 4.8% means Beijing is unlikely to hit its 5.5% growth target for the year.<br />Slower growth is the natural result of Beijing’s zero-Covid fixation, which has led authorities to shutter Shanghai and parts of industrial centers such as Shenzhen and Jilin Province. Retail sales fell nearly 2% month-on-month and 3.5% year-on-year in March. More worrying for the world, growth in industrial production slowed to 5% year-on-year in March, from 7.5% in the January/February period."
