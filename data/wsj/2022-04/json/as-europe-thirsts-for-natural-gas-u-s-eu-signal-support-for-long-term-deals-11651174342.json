    "body": "As Russia moves to cut off natural gas supplies to parts of Europe, U.S. and European Union officials are indicating that they are more open to longer-term deals to ship American fuel across the Atlantic.<br />The EU and U.S. have pledged to expand LNG, or liquefied natural gas, exports to Europe through 2030. But the U.S. is already sending all it can to Europe, and industry officials say expanding volumes will require new, multibillion-dollar export terminals, which traditionally have required long-term contracts from buyers to line up financing."
