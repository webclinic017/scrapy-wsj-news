    "body": "Your editorial “Throwing ‘Shadow Docket’ Shade” (April 8) attributes entirely plausible legal reasoning to the Supreme Court majority in Louisiana v. American Rivers. In her dissenting opinion, Justice Elena Kagan attributed different reasoning to the majority, also entirely plausible. The public has no way to know for which reasons the majority made its decision because it didn’t give any.<br />Justice Amy Coney Barrett made a speech at the Reagan Library on April 4. She referenced the bitter public debate about the legitimacy of the Supreme Court and the increasing tendency to think of it as a group of politicians in robes. Her message was clear and important. She urged the public to “read the opinion” to determine whether the Court made a political decision or a legal decision."
