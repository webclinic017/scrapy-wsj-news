    "body": "SINGAPORE—Palm oil is one of the world’s most ubiquitous food commodities, found in candy bars, ice cream, pizza dough and cooking oil. It is about to get harder to source.<br />Starting Thursday, Indonesia—which accounts for 60% of global supply—will stop palm-oil exports, a sweeping decision that will make cooking meals more expensive for families around the world and cause headaches for a range of food and cosmetics manufacturers. The ban follows a sharp rise in cooking-oil prices at home, caused in large part by disruptions stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine."
