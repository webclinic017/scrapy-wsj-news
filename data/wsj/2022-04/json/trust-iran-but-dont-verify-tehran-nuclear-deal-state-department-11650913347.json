    "body": "Talks in Vienna to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal paused last month, and it isn’t clear whether they’ll resume or officially end. A little-noticed line in a State Department report published last week makes a good case for formally walking away.<br />“The United States has concluded that serious concerns remained outstanding regarding possible undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran,” according to State’s annual report on compliance with arms control and nonproliferation agreements. The document notes that the Islamic Republic has not fully cooperated with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which is trying to investigate possible secret nuclear activity at four sites around the country."
