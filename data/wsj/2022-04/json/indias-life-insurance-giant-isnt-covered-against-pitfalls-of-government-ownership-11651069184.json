    "body": "Life Insurance Corporation of India will hit the markets in May in the country’s largest ever public listing, albeit at a much cheaper price than initially expected. A dominant player with a loyal customer base across India may seem like a good bargain in turbulent times, but investors must take into account the baggage of government ownership.<br />With no end in sight to rocky market conditions, India’s central government has decided to push ahead with the listing of the state-backed behemoth by sharply slashing the size of the public offering. The Indian government will sell a 3.5% stake in LIC, according to the final prospectus filed with exchanges on Tuesday, raising as much as $2.74 billion at the top end of the price range. The previous plan was to offer a 5% stake for about $8 billion."
