    "body": "The November elections are looking good for Republicans, who can pound Democrats on everything from inflation to foreign policy. So naturally the GOP is engaging in some self-destructive behavior: Witness the spectacle in Tennessee, where the state party has booted a congressional candidate endorsed by Donald Trump off the primary ballot.<br />We’ve told readers about the shenanigans in Tennessee, where state legislators recently tried to disqualify some candidates for Congress by passing a three-year residency requirement in the middle of an election cycle. This was a naked effort to hamstring the political competition. The bill became law without the Governor’s signature earlier this month, but state officials ruled it doesn’t apply retroactively."
