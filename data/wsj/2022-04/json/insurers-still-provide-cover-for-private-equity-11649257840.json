    "body": "Private-equity managers may not be favorites of stock market investors right now, but they still rank highly with another very important constituency: insurers.<br />Shares of big alternative-asset and private-equity firms are generally underperforming financials overall this year. Financials in the S&P 500 index are down about 4%, versus a drop of around 8% for shares of  Blackstone  and double-digit declines for  Apollo Global Management ,   Carlyle Group  and  KKR  & Co. That marks a reversal from big outperformance last year."
