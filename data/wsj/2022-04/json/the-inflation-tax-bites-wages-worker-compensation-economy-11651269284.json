    "body": "The headlines Friday said that worker compensation grew at a record pace in this year’s first quarter, according to the Labor Department. That would be nice—if it weren’t for the inflation that is wiping out those hefty nominal gains.<br />Wages and salaries rose 5% for private workers in the 12 months through March, and benefits rose 4.1%. Private employers are paying a lot more to keep workers, who have bargaining power amid a labor shortage."
