    "body": "The Federal Reserve and other central banks are trying to execute that most delicate of maneuvers, a soft landing by which they can pull inflation back down to earth without crashing the economy into recession. The danger? That instead they’ll thud down onto the hard concrete of an appreciating dollar.<br />The dollar’s phenomenal appreciation of recent months is the biggest business and economic story that is almost nowhere to be seen in the business and economic press, with the exception of this newspaper’s editorial column. Compared with its lowest level of the past 12 months, the greenback has risen in value nearly 20% versus the Japanese yen to a 20-year high, and 13% versus the euro to a two-year high. The dollar has risen to around $1.08 a euro from $1.22 around a year ago, and “parity” is starting to appear in some discussions."
