    "body": "Wall Street has long known that it is better to play with other people’s money. But in the case of Elon Musk, other people’s money may limit just how much playing he can do with  Twitter .<br />The campaign by the World’s Richest Person on paper to take over the social network has proven to be a success. Twitter announced Monday afternoon that a deal has been reached, at the price of $54.20 per share in cash that was Mr. Musk’s initial offer from April 14. Twitter’s board was reportedly compelled to give the bid a fresh look after Mr. Musk filed papers late last week reporting $46.5 billion in financial backing for the bid."
