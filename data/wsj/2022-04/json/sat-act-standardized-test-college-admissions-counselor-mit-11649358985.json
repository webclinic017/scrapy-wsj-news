    "body": "Regarding Jason Riley’s “MIT Leads the Way in Reinstating the SAT” (Upward Mobility, April 6): Students from higher-income households tend to perform better on virtually all admissions criteria, not only the SAT and ACT. But the tests can help identify students who might otherwise be overlooked.<br />In 1964 I was applying to colleges. A counselor advised me not to bother with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I ignored that advice. My next meeting with that counselor was to review my SAT scores. He looked at them in stunned amazement. I was probably one of those students who would have been overlooked without the SAT. I am still proud to be MIT class of 1969."
