    "body": "Rapidly rising interest rates are waking people up to the earning potential of cash. That will be an adjustment for banks and brokers—but it isn’t the end of the world.<br />Across banking, there is worry among investors about how quickly cheap deposits may reprice or depart in search of better yields. For brokerage giant and bank  Charles Schwab ,  this pressure comes in the form of what it calls cash sorting: People take some of their yet-to-be invested cash that is earning very little and move it into a money-market fund or other higher-yielding alternative. Even if the money is moved into a money-market fund offered by Schwab, that typically nets less in fees for Schwab than what it would earn deploying that same cash on its own balance sheet."
