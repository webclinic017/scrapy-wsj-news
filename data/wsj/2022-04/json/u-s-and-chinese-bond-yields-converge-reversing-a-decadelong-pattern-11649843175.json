    "body": "For more than a decade, government bonds in China yielded substantially more than their U.S. counterparts, making the yuan-denominated debt securities a big draw for global investors wanting exposure to the world’s second-largest economy.<br />That yield advantage vanished on Monday this week—at least in nominal terms. The yield on benchmark 10-year Chinese government bonds closed at 2.767% that day, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ended at 2.779%."
