    "body": "Amazon is pushing back against the recent union election at its Staten Island facility in a novel way: by taking on the National Labor Relations Board itself, alleging that the NLRB behaved in ways showing bias in favor of the union. In the process, Amazon may force courts to clarify an important ambiguity in American labor law and make the NLRB, the agency charged with overseeing workplace elections, act more neutrally.<br />In the 25 official objections Amazon filed with the board, the company argues that the NLRB’s “interference and mismanagement” prevented “a free and fair election” at its Staten Island facility. Among other things, Amazon alleges that the board arbitrarily excluded some workers from the bargaining unit in which the union had to show 30% support to hold a vote. The company also alleges the NLRB let union representatives distribute marijuana to workers in exchange for votes and intimidate workers opposed to collective bargaining. (The union’s lawyer told the Associated Press that  the intimidation allegation is “patently absurd” and handing out marijuana “is no different from distributing free T-shirts and it certainly did not act to interfere with the election.”)"
