    "body": "More Americans are being mugged as crime spikes in major cities, and more Democrats are being mugged by this political reality. The latest lurch away from the left on crime and policing is occurring in Philadelphia, the city of an unbrotherly spike in murder and mayhem.<br />Mayor Jim Kenneyâ€™s recent budget proposal includes a $23.7 million funding increase that would bring the police budget to $781.8 million in fiscal 2023. Current officers would get a $1,500 bonus and 9% pay raise over three years.  The proposal also includes phone upgrades for cops to make it easier for the public to contact them, as well as improvements to the forensic science lab to solve crimes."
