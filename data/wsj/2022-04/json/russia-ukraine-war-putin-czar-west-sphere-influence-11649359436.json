    "body": "“Putin Targeted Ukraine for Years. Why Didn’t the West Stop Him?” (Review, April 2) ascribes the roots of the war to Russia’s deep ambivalence about its place in the world and Mr. Putin’s search for restoration of Russian greatness. Another part of why we failed to stop Vladimir Putin is that we refused to accept that Russians also are entitled to their fair share of exceptionalism and to have security concerns of their own (a la the Monroe Doctrine to keep great powers out of the Western Hemisphere).<br />The longer we withhold from others the legitimacy that we grant ourselves, the longer we will misdiagnose this conflict, a desperate tragedy for Ukrainians. The world is no longer unipolar, and we in the West need to address the much more threatening challenge from China."
