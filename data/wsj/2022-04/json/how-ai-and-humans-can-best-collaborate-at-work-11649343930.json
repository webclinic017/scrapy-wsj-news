    "body": "Research shows that humans and machines working together often perform better than either humans or artificial intelligence alone. Anecdote suggests the same: Chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov responded to his 1997 defeat by the  IBM  supercomputer Deep Blue by introducing a new form of chess in which humans could consult with computers before deciding on moves. The idea that human-machine teams could outperform in chess if they know how to work together then began to gain steam.<br />But even if you’re sold on the idea that the future of work is human-machine partnership, how exactly does one collaborate productively with AI? It isn’t as if a human and AI can meet over lunch and hash it out."
