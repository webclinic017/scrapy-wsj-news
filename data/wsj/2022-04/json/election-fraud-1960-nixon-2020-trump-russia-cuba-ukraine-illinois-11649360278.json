    "body": "In “Nixon’s Example of Sanity in Washington” (Declarations, April 2), Peggy Noonan argues that Richard Nixon was a patriot because he refused to challenge the results of the 1960 presidential election despite credible evidence of voting fraud. She conflates patriotism with concession.<br />Nixon was known to be more hawkish on the Russians and a more seasoned statesman than John F. Kennedy. Nikita Khrushchev believed that Kennedy could be manhandled, and placed nuclear warheads 90 miles from our shores, bringing the world closer to nuclear armageddon than it had ever been before."
