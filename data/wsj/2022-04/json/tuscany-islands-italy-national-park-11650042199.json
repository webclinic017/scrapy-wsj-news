    "body": "ACCORDING TO myth, the seven islands forming the Tuscan Archipelago came from pearls that the Greek goddess of love, Aphrodite, lost in the Tyrrhenian Sea during a visit. Later, the archipelago’s dramatic views as well as its proximity to Rome, about 200 miles away, made it a popular place for plutocrats to vacation. You can find ruins of the grand seaside villas and gardens they built throughout the islands.<br />The archipelago remains a delight. And unlike the storied attractions at Italy’s better known destinations that regularly endure tourist stampedes, many of the natural and historic wonders here are preserved, often with restricted access, in the Tuscan Archipelago National Park, one of Europe’s largest marine parks. Due to the archipelago’s distinctive ecosystems, which include endemic flora and fauna, the entire area has been designated a Unesco Biosphere Reserve, and recreational activity is controlled in many areas. But as I discovered during my visit last summer, there is still plenty of space for adventure."
