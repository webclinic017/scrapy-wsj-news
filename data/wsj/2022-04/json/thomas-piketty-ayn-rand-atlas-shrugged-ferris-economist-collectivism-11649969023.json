    "body": "“All creations of wealth in history have issued from a collective process,” writes Thomas Piketty in his book “A Brief History of Equality” (Tunku Varadarajan, Books, April 9). Arguing for aggressive redistribution of the spoils of capitalism, Mr. Piketty writes that this collective process includes the division of labor, the use of global natural resources, and “the accumulation of knowledge since the beginnings of humanity.”<br />This recalls Dr. Floyd Ferris in Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged,” a dystopian novel. “A man’s brain is a social product. A sum of influences that he’s picked up from those around him,” Ferris says. “Nobody invents anything, he merely reflects what’s floating in the social atmosphere. A genius is an intellectual scavenger and a greedy hoarder of the ideas which rightfully belong to society, from which he stole them. All thought is theft. If we do away with private fortunes, we’ll have a fairer distribution of wealth. If we do away with genius, we’ll have a fairer distribution of ideas.”"
