    "body": "The froth has come out of  General Motors ’ stock as cost inflation has picked up and the gap between its tech-star aspirations and today’s reality has become clearer. Value-focused investors might consider it a good moment to buy.<br />First-quarter earnings from the largest Detroit auto maker, published late Tuesday, were better than analysts forecast thanks to vehicle prices that remain sky-high. While GM’s sales rose slightly year-over-year as the semiconductor shortage eased, the main driver of revenue growth was the average transaction price, which at the U.S. retail level was a full $10,200 more than in the same period last year."
