    "body": "Sri Lanka said it would suspend foreign debt repayments, as the country suffering from double-digit inflation and daily power outages seeks to conserve its dwindling foreign reserves for essential food and fuel imports.<br />On Tuesday, Sri Lanka’s finance ministry said a comprehensive restructuring of its outstanding foreign-denominated debt was required and that the government had approached the International Monetary Fund for emergency financial assistance. It said the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine—which have hurt tourism revenue and driven up commodity prices—had eroded the country’s finances to the point it could no longer pay its debts."
