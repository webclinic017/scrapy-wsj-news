    "body": "Low-wage workers capitalized on the rare opportunity of a tight labor market with a burst of job-switching. That wave shows signs of easing now and economists say that, apart from a one-off rise in wages, these workers may not end up much better off than before.<br />The rise in quitting reflected the circumstances of the pandemic, economists say: In many cases, whole workforces were let go in March 2020 as restaurants, event spaces and stores closed, some temporarily and others permanently. Rehiring months later wasnâ€™t as simple as just asking former employees to return to work."
