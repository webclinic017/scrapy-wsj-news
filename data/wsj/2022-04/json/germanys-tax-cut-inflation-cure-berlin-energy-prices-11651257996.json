    "body": "American progressives say they want the U.S. to be more like Europe, and here’s their chance: Berlin this week unveiled a raft of energy tax cuts to ease the sting of rapidly escalating inflation. It’s a useful contrast to Democrats’ current plan to raise taxes as an inflation cure.<br />Berlin hasn’t seen the supply-side tax-cut light, alas, so the measures announced recently amount to nibbling around the edges rather than the major tax reform Germany needs. But every bit helps. One proposal increases the tax allowance for individuals by some 3%, making the first €10,347 ($10,900) of annual income tax-free."
