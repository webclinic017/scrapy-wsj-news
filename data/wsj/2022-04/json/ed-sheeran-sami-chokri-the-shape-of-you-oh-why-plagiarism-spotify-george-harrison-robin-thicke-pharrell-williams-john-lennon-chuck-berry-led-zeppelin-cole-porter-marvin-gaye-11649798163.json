    "body": "<br />In a closely watched ruling on Wednesday in a London courtroom, Justice Antony Zacaroli found that British singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran and his co-writers of the hit song “The Shape of You” had “neither deliberately, nor subconsciously” infringed on the copyright of Sami Chokri, who performs as Sami Switch, and his song “Oh Why.”"
