    "body": "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is exposing the trade-offs in a hot Wall Street product meant to encourage good governance.<br />Environmental, social and governance, or ESG, funds have become a top trend, promising to boost returns while bettering the world by avoiding countries prone to pollution, corruption, and even war.
