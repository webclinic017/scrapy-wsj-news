    "body": "Such is the state of the chip industry that the better the numbers get, the worse investors seem to feel about it.<br />The Semiconductor Industry Association reported Monday that global sales for the sector hit $52.5 billion in February. That is a new monthly record that’s also up nearly a third from the same month last year—the best growth rate the industry has seen since 2010, when sales were half their current level."
