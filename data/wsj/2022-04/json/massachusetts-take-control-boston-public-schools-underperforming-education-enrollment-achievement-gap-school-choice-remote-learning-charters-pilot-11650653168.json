    "body": "Boston<br />Boston is a different city today than in 1974, when working-class whites rioted against a federal judge’s order to desegregate the schools via forced busing. Tribalism has been smoothed over by prosperity. In 2021, after decades of Irish and Italian mayors, voters put 36-year-old Michelle Wu in City Hall. The school system is now steaming with fervor for social justice. But one thing hasn’t changed: Boston still does a poor job of educating kids,  especially the majority who are Hispanic and black."
