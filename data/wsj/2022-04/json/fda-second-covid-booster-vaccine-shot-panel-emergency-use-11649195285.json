    "body": "In “FDA Shuts Out Its Own Experts in Authorizing Another Booster” (op-ed, April 4), Marty Makary focuses on the wrong question. He chastises the Food and Drug Administration for not holding an advisory committee on this emergency-use authorization, but there was no need to hold one.<br />There’s no value in convening an expert panel when the facts are clear: A second booster safely increases Covid-19 antibody count in higher-risk cohorts (age 50+, immunocompromised, some pre-existing conditions). No need for outside advice when the data speaks so plainly."
