    "body": "The Senate approved Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination to the Supreme Court last week, but she isn’t yet Justice Jackson. Justice Stephen Breyer won’t retire until this summer. So where is the vacancy Judge Jackson was confirmed to fill?<br />The Justice Department claims there is no problem confirming nominees before an actual vacancy. But that same logic would permit the president to appoint slates of standby justices in case his party loses the Senate in the midterms."
