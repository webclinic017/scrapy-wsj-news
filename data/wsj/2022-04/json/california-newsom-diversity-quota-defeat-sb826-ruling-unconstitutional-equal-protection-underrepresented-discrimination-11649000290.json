    "body": "Did California lawmakers consult a lawyer before passing a law that mandates diversity quotas for corporate boards? A state judge late Friday tossed the law on summary judgment, suggesting it was so obviously unconstitutional that it didn’t merit a full trial.<br />The 2020 law required public companies headquartered in California to include at least one board director who identifies as a racial or ethnic minority or as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender by the end of last year. Companies with five to eight board seats would have to include two “underrepresented” members by the end of this year."
