    "body": "U.S. economic growth data for the first quarter may herald some easing in inflation pressures, some economists say.<br />On Thursday, the government reported in its initial estimate of first-quarter growth that the economy shrunk by 1.4%. The government also included information on price pressures for the quarter, showing a 5.2% rise in the core personal-consumption expenditures deflator. Some saw in that weaker-than-expected number the possible makings of an easing in price pressures."
