    "body": "The consumer-welfare standard, defended eloquently by Phil Gramm and Christine Wilson in “The New Progressives Fight Against Consumer Welfare” (op-ed, April 4), is fundamental to advancing the rule of law in antitrust. It provides a clear benchmark for understanding when business conduct is economically beneficial to consumers, while also benefiting workers and producers.<br />When producers obtain raw materials more cheaply, savings can be passed on to consumers. When workers are more productive, they tend to earn more and can buy more goods or save money. Worker efficiency helps companies produce more and better goods, reducing prices further. Consumers are emphasized because, in the end, everyone is a consumer."
