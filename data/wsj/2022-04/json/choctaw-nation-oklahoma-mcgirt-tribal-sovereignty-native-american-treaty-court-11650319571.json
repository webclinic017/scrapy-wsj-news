    "body": "Regarding your editorial “The Case of the White Supremacist Choctaw” (April 12): The Supreme Court’s decision in McGirt v. Oklahoma (2020) hasn’t “resurrected” Native American reservations. The ruling confirmed a bedrock principle of the rule of law: The U.S. must honor the treaties it signed. These binding contracts between two legal entities provide the basis for tribal sovereignty. McGirt confirmed that one side can’t abandon the agreements when they become inconvenient or unpopular.<br />You discusses Robert Wadkins’s case to indicate a larger problem with criminal prosecutions on tribal land in Oklahoma. But even in that case, you acknowledge that a felon hasn’t gone free; his case will simply be adjudicated in the proper jurisdiction."
