    "body": "Life would be easier for commercial property landlords if white-collar employees would just come back to the office. Instead, they must weigh options to refurbish older workplaces or convert them to entirely different uses.<br />Two years after Covid-19 lockdowns forced a shift to remote working, offices remain much emptier than they were in 2019. Average occupancy in the U.S. is 42%, according to Kastle Systems’ latest Back to Work Barometer, which measures swipe-card access. Expensive cities such as San Francisco and New York are lagging behind, perhaps because some employees have moved to more affordable places or are reluctant to return to long daily commutes, whereas Austin has the highest rate nationwide. Across the Atlantic, London’s occupancy peaked at 42% in mid-March, data from Freespace shows."
