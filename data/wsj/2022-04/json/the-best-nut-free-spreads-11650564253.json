    "body": "WITH THE RISING popularity of almond and other nut butters in the first couple decades of this century, the humble peanut, long the spreadable legume of choice, made way for fancier fruit. Now, some of the newest spreads bypass nuts altogether.<br />Pulverized oats, chickpeas, dates and seeds mimic the rich consistency of their nutty counterparts in a growing crop of products. The labels tout nutritional assets beyond what you would find in, say, cookie butter—fiber, vitamins, minimal added sugar—even if some of these spreads look pretty dessert-like themselves. The trend is a boon to the growing number of people reporting allergies to nuts, particularly peanuts—the most common food allergy in children under 18 and the second-most common food allergy in adults, afflicting 3% of the U.S. population today versus less than 1% in 1999, according to the nonprofit group Food Allergy Research & Education."
