    "body": "As Russia consolidates its forces for an offensive in Ukraine’s east, the temptation is to think the stakes have shrunk for NATO and the West after Russia lost the battle of Kyiv. But Vladimir Putin can still win a major victory that would leave him stronger and better able to menace Ukraine, its neighbors and the Western alliance.<br />The Kremlin boss still has broad military ambitions, as one of his generals let slip on Friday. “Since the start of the second phase of the special operation . . . one of the tasks of the Russian army is to establish full control over the Donbas and southern Ukraine,” Major General Rustam Minnekaev was quoted as telling Russian news agencies. “This will provide a land corridor to Crimea,” the peninsula Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014."
