    "body": "The midterms are still months off, but primaries and conventions are approaching in April and May. They’re spiced this year with an unusual element: Donald Trump has endorsed many candidates in key races, aiming to field a general-election team of loyalists who will amplify his message that the 2020 presidential race was stolen.<br />The first contest will be April 23, when Michigan Republicans hold a convention to nominate candidates for attorney general, secretary of state and other down-ballot offices (primaries for governor, Congress and state Legislature are Aug. 2). If Mr. Trump’s candidates for attorney general and secretary of state prevail at the convention, that sets up a clear test this fall of the power of his core message, since they both share his view that his 154,188-vote Michigan defeat resulted from massive fraud."
