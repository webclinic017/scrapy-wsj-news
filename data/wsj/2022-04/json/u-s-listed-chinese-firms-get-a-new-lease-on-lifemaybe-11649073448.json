    "body": "Beijing offered a conciliatory overture in a long-running standoff with Washington over audits of U.S.-listed Chinese companies. That is a concrete first step that could prevent the delisting of hundreds of Chinese companies from American exchanges. The ball now heads back to Washington’s court—where its reception remains highly uncertain.<br />China’s securities regulator proposed revisions to China’s secrecy laws over the weekend that would remove a requirement that audit inspections of overseas-listed Chinese companies be done mainly by Chinese regulators. That has been a key sticking point between China and the U.S. for more than a decade. But the U.S. position has hardened in recent years following a string of high-profile fraud cases involving U.S.-listed Chinese companies like Luckin Coffee, and amid the general deterioration in bilateral relations."
