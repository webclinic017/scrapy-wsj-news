    "body": "Global supply chains have expanded into the developing world, bringing economic opportunities even to countries whose governments have only a tenuous hold on their territory. Contrary to the old adage that trade diminishes war, trade is driving conflict in these places because fighters are adopting a lean business model, often using only a few Kalashnikov rifles, to extort money from everything that moves down roads under their control—including vehicles working for multinational companies and aid organizations.<br />You can get a Coke in Iraq, a Heineken in Congo and powdered Nestlé milk in Myanmar, and you can effortlessly share selfies from these places thanks to the network coverage provided by Huawei and  Ericsson  antennas. All these products and services make their way to consumers in conflict zones, driven by truckers who cater to global brands through complicated networks of contractors and suppliers. This banal, logistical element of supply chains makes them vulnerable to extortion by rebels."
