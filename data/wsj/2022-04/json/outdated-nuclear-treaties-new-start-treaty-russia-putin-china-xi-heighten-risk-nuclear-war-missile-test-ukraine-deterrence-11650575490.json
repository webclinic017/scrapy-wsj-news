    "body": "U.S. nuclear deterrence policy and U.S. nuclear arms-control policy have become dangerously disconnected.<br />Longstanding deterrence policy requires that the U.S. have sufficient capacity to target what potential enemy leaders value most. Arms control is supposed to augment deterrence by limiting, and if possible reducing, the threats while allowing the U.S. to deploy a force that deters an attack on America or our allies. The policies were tightly linked throughout the closing decades of the Cold War, providing the U.S. and its allies with a credible deterrent and producing the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties, known as Start 1 and Start 2, which were signed in 1991 and 1993 respectively and reduced the levels of U.S. and Soviet strategic nuclear weapons."
