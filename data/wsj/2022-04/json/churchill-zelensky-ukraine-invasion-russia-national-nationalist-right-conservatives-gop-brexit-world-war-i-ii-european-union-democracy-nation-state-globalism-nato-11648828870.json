    "body": "What would Winston Churchill make of Europe in 2022? He was a powerful advocate for the nation-state and the concept of national sovereignty. Yet he appreciated that states sometimes need to band together and was a keen supporter of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s founding in April 1949.<br />He was also the father of the concept of the United States of Europe. In speeches in Zurich in 1946, The Hague in 1948 and Strasbourg, France, in 1949, he promoted the idea that the nation-states of Western Europe band together in a free-trade Zollverein, which he hoped would make war impossible between states whose enmity had led to the loss of many of his friends’ lives, not once but twice earlier in the century. “Let Europe arise!” he said at Zurich."
