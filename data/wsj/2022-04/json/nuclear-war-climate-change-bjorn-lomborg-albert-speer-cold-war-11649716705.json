    "body": "Regarding Bjorn Lomborg’s op-ed “Be Afraid of Nuclear War, Not Climate Change” (March 30): I experienced the climate-change-or-nuclear-war conundrum as a student in 1971, while interviewing Albert Speer, the former Nazi minister of armaments, at his home in West Germany. I contacted Speer, who had recently published “Inside the Third Reich,” and he agreed to meet. I asked what he considered the greatest threat facing the world. Sitting in Heidelberg, only 120 miles from the Fulda gap, where several Warsaw Pact armies with tactical nuclear weapons were poised to storm across West Germany, I naturally expected the threat of nuclear war to be his response. Instead, he replied: “Pollution.”<br />At first, I thought this was a formulaic response that he believed young American college students like me would appreciate hearing. But he actually meant it. I found myself in the odd position of trying to persuade him, of all people, of the more immediate danger of global war if our enemies perceived military weakness in NATO. He seemed unconvinced."
