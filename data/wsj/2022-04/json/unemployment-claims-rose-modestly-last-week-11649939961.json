    "body": "New applications for U.S. unemployment benefits rose last week, but remained near historically low levels as employers held on to workers in a tight labor market.<br />Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, rose to 185,000 during the week that ended on April 9, compared with a revised 167,000 the week prior, the Labor Department said Thursday. New claims had fallen to the lowest point since 1968 in early April."
