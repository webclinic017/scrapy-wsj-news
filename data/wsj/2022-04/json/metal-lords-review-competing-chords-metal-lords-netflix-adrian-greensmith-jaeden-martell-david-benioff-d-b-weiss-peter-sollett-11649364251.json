    "body": "“Metal Lords,” Friday, Netflix.<br />A good way to describe “Metal Lords” is to admit that it resists description. Is it about misfit adolescents? Yes. Is young love involved? Of course. Do the protagonists want to form a heavy-metal band in a high school where Ed Sheeran rules and the marching band actually bleats out “St. James Infirmary” as it makes its funereal way across the football field? Indeed. But few characters or situations are clichéd, few are as good or bad as the post-John Hughes template usually demands of teen comedies, and the ostensible hero is a musical fundamentalist with too much money."
