    "body": "Reading Leslie Lenkowsky’s review of “Private Virtues, Public Vices” by Emma Saunders-Hastings (Bookshelf, April 20), I couldn’t help but think about Julius Rosenwald, the great philanthropist who built Sears, Roebuck & Co. and donated masses of money. He sponsored Chicago’s Museum of Science and Industry and established more than 5,000 schools for African-Americans in the Jim Crow South.<br />It was Rosenwald’s desire to discontinue his foundation upon his passing. He believed that his contributions were needed only during the time that he could guide his efforts. He passed on his wealth to his children, all of whom became philanthropists themselves. It would be a dream to think that today’s plutocrats could feel as comfortable discontinuing their influence in a timely fashion."
