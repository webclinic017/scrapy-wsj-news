    "body": "THE CONNECTION BETWEEN Mason Hereford’s dishes and the city where he invents them is not straightforward or traditional. “In one way, New Orleans has influenced my cooking with big flavors,” he said. Making sure those flavors harmonize is Mr. Hereford’s gift and what makes this sandwich, his final Slow Food Fast recipe, stand out.<br />“We’re always looking for new vegetarian sandwiches,” Mr. Hereford said of the process that led him to this combination of fat asparagus spears cooked al dente, roasted tomatoes, shaved Parmesan and an herby chimichurri cream cheese, served on toasted sourdough. “The asparagus and cream cheese are light,” he said. “And the tomatoes and Parmesan introduce another layer of flavor that isn’t obvious.”"
