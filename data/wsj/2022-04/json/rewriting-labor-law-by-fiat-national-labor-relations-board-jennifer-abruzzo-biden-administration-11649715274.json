    "body": "Progressives are pushing the Biden Administration to enact their agenda by executive fiat, and Jennifer Abruzzo is on the case. The National Labor Relations Board general counsel last week issued a memo that overturns 75 years of legal practice and strips companies of free-speech rights.<br />The Abruzzo memo rewrites the law on the settled question of captive audience meetings, in which companies are allowed to communicate their opposition to union attempts to organize employees. Congress recognized this First Amendment right in the National Labor Relations Act, writing that the corporate expression “of any views, argument or opinion, or the dissemination thereof . . . shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair labor practice.”"
