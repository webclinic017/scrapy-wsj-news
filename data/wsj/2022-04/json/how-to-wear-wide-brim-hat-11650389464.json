    "body": "I’M NOT HIP or particularly well-dressed, at least not as measured against other men who might write about fashion. I’m an exhausted dad and newspaper editor at The Wall Street Journal’s Washington, D.C., bureau whose heretofore edgiest accessory was a leather Fitbit band. But after my twin brother had a skin-cancer scare, my dermatologist advised I wear a wide-brim hat to block the sun. On doctor’s orders, I became a Hat Guy.<br />In a 1949 photograph my grandfather—then 40, younger than I am now—sports a fedora, the brim snapped downward to his right eye. Back then, the hat was a standard part of a man’s wardrobe. But in the decades since, fashion has grown more egalitarian and casual. Now the wide-brim look is mostly reserved for confident cowboys, fashion guys, movie stars and musicians."
