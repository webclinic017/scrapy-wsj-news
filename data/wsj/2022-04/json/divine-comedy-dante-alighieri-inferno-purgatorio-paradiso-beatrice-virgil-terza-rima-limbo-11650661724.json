    "body": "<br />T.S. Eliot said: “Dante and Shakespeare divide the world between them. There is no third.” Hamlet speaks of the afterlife as “the undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns.” Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) attempted to trace the boundaries of that country for us in his “Divine Comedy.”"
