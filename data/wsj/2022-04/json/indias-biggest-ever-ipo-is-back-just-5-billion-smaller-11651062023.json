    "body": "Turbulent financial markets have forced India’s government to slash the size of the country’s largest-ever IPO by roughly two-thirds, sharply reducing the contribution that the deal will make to the public purse.<br />The initial public offering of the state-owned Life Insurance Corp. of India comes as global markets are confronting a series of challenges, including high inflation, slowing growth, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the prospect of rapid rises in interest rates. World IPO volumes have tumbled 72% year-over-year to $67.2 billion so far in 2022, Dealogic data shows."
