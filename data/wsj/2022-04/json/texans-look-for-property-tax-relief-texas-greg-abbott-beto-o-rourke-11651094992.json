    "body": "Texas’ lack of an income tax has made it an economic oasis, but Texans aren’t entirely free of the taxman. The state’s property taxes are among the nation’s highest, and they are rising fast. This week voters have a chance to slow the growth and stop Texas from becoming Illinois on the Rio Grande.<br />Early voting began Monday on a pair of state constitutional amendments that the Legislature approved overwhelmingly last year. (Election Day is May 7.) The first lets state legislators reduce the cap on the property taxes that school districts assess on residents over age 65. Like many other states, property taxes in Texas are levied by county and local governments, and schools get the biggest cut. The amendment would commit the state to make up for schools’ lost revenue."
