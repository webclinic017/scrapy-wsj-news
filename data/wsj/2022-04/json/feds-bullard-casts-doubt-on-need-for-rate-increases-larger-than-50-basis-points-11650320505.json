    "body": "One of the Federal Reserve’s earliest advocates for aggressive rate increases won’t rule out a truly supersize rise, though he doesn’t expect one is needed.<br />When it comes to the size of a rate increase, one greater than 50 basis points “is not my base case,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said during a virtual appearance Monday.
