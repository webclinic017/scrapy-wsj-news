    "body": "Elon Musk often makes news with his  Twitter  posts, and rarely more than on Tuesday in confirming he has bought a 9.2% stake in the social-media firm. He’s now the single largest shareholder and has earned a seat on the board. Mr. Musk hasn’t disclosed his agenda for the company, but for now we’ll consider this a hopeful moment for political speech and debate at America’s increasingly censorious tech giants.<br />“Looking forward to working with [Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal] & Twitter board to make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months,” Mr. Musk tweeted Tuesday to his more than 80 million followers on the site. The cofounder of ventures ranging from  Tesla ,  to SpaceX, to the Boring Company has frequently expressed disdain for Twitter’s heavy-handed censorship, which the company uses to silence prominent voices (e.g., Donald Trump) and stifle views that disagree with the prevailing progressive consensus."
