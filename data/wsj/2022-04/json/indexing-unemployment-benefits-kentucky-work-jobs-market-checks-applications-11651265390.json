    "body": "Louisville, Ky.<br />When my wife and I recently dined at Hiko-A-Mon, a favorite local restaurant, we weren’t surprised by the “Help Wanted” sign on the door. It’s a familiar sight across the city. But we soon realized the sign was a plea. A single server was waiting on about 25 groups of diners. We tipped her well, and hoped others did too, because she was in an untenable situation and working hard to keep up. From talking with her, it was clear she had no idea when she’d get a break."
