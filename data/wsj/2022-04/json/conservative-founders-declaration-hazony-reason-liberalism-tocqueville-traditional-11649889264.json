    "body": "Barton Swaim’s illuminating book review “Grumbles Left and Right” (April 9) highlights well the troubles plaguing contemporary conservatism. His comments on Yoram Hazony’s “Conservatism: A Rediscovery” point to the author’s rigid use of dichotomies to separate the wheat from the tares within American conservatism.<br />Readers of Mr. Hazony’s earlier book on nationalism may recall a similar deployment of empires and nations as the sole way to think about political forms, excluding regime types like republicanism. In Mr. Hazony’s telling, conservatism in the U.S. has been a contest between naked reason, which ends in deracinated individualism, and empirically minded traditionalism."
