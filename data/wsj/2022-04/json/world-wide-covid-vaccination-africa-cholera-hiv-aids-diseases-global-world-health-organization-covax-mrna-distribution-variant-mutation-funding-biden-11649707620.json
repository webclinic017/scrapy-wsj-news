    "body": "President Biden is asking Congress for $5 billion to pay for a global Covid vaccination campaign. The goal, set by the World Health Organization, is to vaccinate 70% of the population in every country. But other infectious diseases that are much deadlier than Covid in low-income countries have taken a back seat during the pandemic. It’s time to reset public-health priorities.<br />Vaccinating the world against Covid won’t prevent new variants from emerging, because vaccines don’t prevent the virus from spreading. Vaccines can slow transmission for a short period at best. The most effective vaccines provide only short-term protection against infection and even less against the Omicron variant. Large shares of lower-income countries already have natural immunity from infection, which is as protective as vaccines. A recent study estimated that some 65% of Africans had Covid antibodies as of last fall. The share is probably much higher now."
