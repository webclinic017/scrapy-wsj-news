    "body": "The Food and Drug Administration evaluates drugs for safety and efficacy, but now the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services wants to act as a political check on the FDA’s decisions. Last week CMS refused to cover a novel Alzheimer’s treatment for millions of patients because it disagreed with FDA approval.<br />Biogen ’s  Aduhelm is the first FDA-approved treatment shown to slow the progression of Alzheimer's. But the drug is now ensnared in a political fight. The public-health left thinks FDA is approving too many new expensive drugs with marginal benefits, and it wants CMS to overrule the drug agency. Progressives are cheering CMS’s Aduhelm decision as a precedent that the agency can restrict access to new FDA-approved treatments. Aduhelm is the target today, but cancer and gene therapies could be next."
