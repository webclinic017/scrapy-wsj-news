    "body": "For decades, the environmental lobby has, with no little sanctimony, owned up to its efforts to keep energy in the ground (“Biden’s Great Energy Contradiction,” Review & Outlook, March 26). It stalls gas pipelines, shuts down coal-fired plants, blocks oil production and organizes hostility to nuclear power.<br />Those same activists who dismissed the importance of energy security must now share ownership of the miseries resulting from energy insecurity, and from a war stemming in part from the West’s reliance on a ruthless autocrat to supply the energy it failed to produce for itself."
