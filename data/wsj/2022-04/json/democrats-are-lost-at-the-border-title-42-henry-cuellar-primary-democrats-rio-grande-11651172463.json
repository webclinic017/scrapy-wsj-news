    "body": "The Congressional Hispanic Caucus met with Joe Biden on Monday to demand an end to Title 42 border restrictions, as well as new protections for hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants. Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar—who knows a little something about politics—wasn’t along for the ride.<br />Mr. Cuellar, a centrist Democrat, represents the 28th District, which stretches from San Antonio to the Mexican border. South Texas has long been a Democratic stronghold, and Mr. Cuellar is the 28th’s man. As the Democratic Party shifts ever left, he has stayed true to guns, God, energy jobs and border security. His voters—76% Hispanic, largely blue collar and socially conservative—have rewarded him with 17 years in Congress."
