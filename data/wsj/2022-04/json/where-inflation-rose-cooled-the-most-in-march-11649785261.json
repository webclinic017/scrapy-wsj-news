    "title": "Where Inflation Rose, Cooled the Most in March",
    "sub_head": "Gasoline and groceries drove broader consumer prices higher, but the cost of fast-food meals and used cars eased",
    "category_1": "Economy",
    "time": "2022-04-12 13:41:00",
    "body": "Gasoline and groceries helped drive up overall prices in March at the fastest monthly rate in nearly two decades, though consumers started to feel less of a price sting at restaurants and used-car dealerships.<br />Gasoline prices soared last month as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine pushed up crude-oil prices. Groceries bills jumped in March from a month earlier as costs for meat, eggs and citrus fruits climbed, Tuesday’s Labor Department report showed."
