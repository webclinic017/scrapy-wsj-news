    "body": "From his letter “The Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma Responds on McGirt” (April 20), Chief Garry Batton seems not to have read the opinions in McGirt v. Oklahoma. The Supreme Court did not hold, let alone confirm as a bedrock principle, that the U.S. must honor treaties. To the contrary, the entire court agreed that Congress has the power to renege on treaties. The majority concluded that in the case of disestablishing the Choctaw reservation, Congress had never actually done so.<br />The problems that have emerged from the McGirt decision could be remedied promptly by Congress. Rather than scolding Justice Neil Gorsuch for his majority opinion, let’s call on Congress to fix the problem with legislation."
