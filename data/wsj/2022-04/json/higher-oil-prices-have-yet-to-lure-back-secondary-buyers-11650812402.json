    "body": "Improvements in oil prices over the past year may be bolstering cash flows at some private equity-backed oil-and-gas companies but it hasn’t lured secondary buyers back to bid for interests in funds focused on the sector, at least not yet.<br />“You can’t trade private-equity energy funds off of spot oil prices,” said Michael Dean, managing director in the real assets team at HarbourVest Partners, adding that higher oil prices have made companies more profitable but have yet to contribute to a significant uptick in exits by oil-and-gas funds."
