    "body": "The art of war is always evolving. Those who anticipate these changes are most likely to prevail the next time conflict arrives. But pre-emptive reforms, which are by nature untested, are often controversial. This is the problem facing Marine Corps Commandant Gen. David H. Berger’s dramatic reform program. Critics, such as former Navy Secretary Jim Webb, argue that he is making a terrible mistake, but the commandant’s ideas would prepare the U.S. to better face its primary enemy: China.<br />It’s certainly true that Gen. Berger’s Force Design 2030 reforms are near revolutionary. Under his plan, the Marine Corps would dramatically shrink its cannon artillery and helicopter forces while eliminating its tank forces. Several infantry battalions and their supporting elements would be cut. Gen. Berger admits these reforms carry risk and have sparked controversy within the Marine Corps. But the Marines have finite resources, which are organized around maintaining democratic international order and defeating the largest threat to America. In today’s world, that’s China."
