    "body": "When employers are in great need of relatively scarce workers, the balance of power in the labor market shifts. This was made clear this month when pro-union  Amazon  employees in Staten Island, N.Y., won a long-shot victory and when the second  Starbucks  location in the company’s hometown of Seattle voted to unionize. These major wins for organized labor have energized the labor movement at a time when it was already on the rise. The number of union-representation petitions filed with the National Labor Relations Board has surged by 57% over the past six months relative to the same period a year ago.<br />More broadly, workers are in the driver’s seat. This shows up in employer concessions on working conditions, flexibility and benefits and in wage growth. Last month nominal average wages for nonsupervisory workers increased at a 6.7% annual rate. Though this pace isn’t fast enough to keep up with inflation, it is considerably faster than the pre-pandemic norm. Nominal average wages in the leisure and hospitality sector increased by 11.8%."
