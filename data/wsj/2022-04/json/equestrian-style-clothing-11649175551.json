    "body": "GROWING UP outside of Washington, D.C., with horse country just a short drive away, Daniella Kallmeyer aspired to be an equestrian. “I had dreams of riding horses when I was a kid, but I never did,” said the 35-year-old fashion designer from her New York studio. While Ms. Kallmeyer says her obsession with saddling up has waned, the aesthetic appeal of a rider’s uniform remains a reference point in her eponymous label’s collections, as well as in her own wardrobe. Last year, she purchased a pair of tall black field boots from Manhattan Saddlery (one of the city’s oldest tack shops) to wear with dresses and pleated skirts.<br />The equestrian look canters back into style every decade or so, and in 2022, riding boots, tailored hunt jackets and even breeches feel as natural at Ralph Lauren’s Polo Bar restaurant in New York as on an actual polo field. The style’s current prevalence no doubt reflects the abundance of fashionable riders in the public eye—among them, Mary-Kate Olsen, co-designer of the Row, and Georgina Bloomberg, a philanthropist and professional equestrian—as well as the herds of equestrian-themed wares that have lately trotted down the runway."
