    "body": "Hot Springs, S.D.<br />The attorney general of South Dakota killed a man. Around 10:30 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 12, 2020, Jason Ravnsborg was driving home to the state capital of Pierre when he ran down Joe Boever, 55, who was walking along the shoulder of the road. Boever’s face smashed through the windshield of Mr. Ravnsborg’s red Ford Taurus hard enough to leave his eyeglasses in the car. He then bounced off into the long grass. Mr. Ravnsborg pulled over to call 911—only to identify himself as the attorney general and explain that he had hit something on Highway 14 about a mile outside the small town of Highmore."
