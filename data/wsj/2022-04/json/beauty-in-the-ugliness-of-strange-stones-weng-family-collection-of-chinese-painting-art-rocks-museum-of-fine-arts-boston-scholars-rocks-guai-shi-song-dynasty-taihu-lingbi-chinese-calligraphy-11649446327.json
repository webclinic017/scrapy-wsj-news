It isn’t part of “Art Rocks,” the last in the three-part series of “Weng Family Collection of Chinese Painting” exhibitions, but it offers a wonderful prologue. Massive, ungainly and pockmarked, the gray stone rises some 14 feet, as though lava had shot up from the pedestal, hit cold air and solidified into a misshapen mushroom. Pretty it is not. But intriguing and compelling? Absolutely."
