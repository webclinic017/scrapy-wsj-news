    "body": "The editorial board levies legitimate criticisms of the Biden administration’s energy policy, but its skepticism about ethanol is based on mistaken premises (“Biden’s Ethanol Gas Price Trick,” April 13).<br />First, it’s wrong that ethanol is bad for the environment and cars. Higher blends of ethanol are not only cheaper, but are also safe and green. Carbon-dioxide emissions from increased land use are more than offset by the replacement of nonrenewable fossil fuels with renewable ethanol. Ethanol also doesn’t meaningfully increase food prices, as it is a natural, nonprotein coproduct of the creation of corn feed for livestock."
