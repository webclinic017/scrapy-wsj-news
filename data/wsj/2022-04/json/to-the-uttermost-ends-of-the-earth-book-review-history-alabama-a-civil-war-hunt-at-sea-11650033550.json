    "body": "Good naval-pursuit stories walk a fine line. Days and nights of dull watches and putrid food are punctuated by the terrors of sea storms and savage battles. Balance and pacing are crucial to the story’s flow. From Herman Melville’s “Moby-Dick” to C.S. Forester’s “The Last Nine Days of the Bismarck,” sea-hunt tales, when done right, combine “man versus nature” and “man versus man” conflicts into a single narrative.<br />In “To the Uttermost Ends of the Earth,” Phil Keith and Tom Clavin—whose many books on American history include their previous collaborative effort, “All Blood Runs Red” (2019)—dive into the true story of two naval commanders who played a deadly game of cat-and-mouse across the Atlantic Ocean during the American Civil War."
