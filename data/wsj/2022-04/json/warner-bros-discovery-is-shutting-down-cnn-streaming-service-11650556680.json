    "body": "CNN is shutting down its streaming service CNN+ about a month after it launched, a sign of its new owners’ lack of faith in the viability of a subscription-based stand-alone news platform.<br />The decision to pull the plug on CNN+, which was off to an underwhelming start, came less than two weeks after CNN ownership shifted from AT&T Inc. to a newly created company called  Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.,  the result of a merger of the entertainment and news assets of the telecom giant and Discovery."
