    "body": "Based on the French series “Call My Agent!” and set in London, the eight-part “Ten Percent” is the sort of fiction whose appeal, emotional or other, will at first seem elusive. The lead characters in John Morton’s drama—employees of the Nightingale Hart talent agency including agency head Richard Nightingale (Jim Broadbent); his son and colleague Jonathan (Jack Davenport); senior partner Stella Hart (Maggie Steed); and fellow agents Rebecca Fox (Lydia Leonard) and Dan Bala (Prasanna Puwanarajah)—are, at first sight, flat, undistinguished and predictable as they go about their task of finding work for clients hoping to secure their place in show business. But it’s a measure of the speed with which writer-director Morton’s skills make themselves felt that “Ten Percent” quickly establishes something close to a perfect blend of satire and geniality in this portrait of a ruthlessly competitive world. One of the most compelling performances in a work amply endowed with them, and in which prominent British actors sometimes play themselves, is that of Tim McInnerny as the aging actor and original Nightingale client Simon Gould.<br />In the opening episode, the British staff at Nightingale Hart is faced with an increasing array of challenges—its trusted guide and leader, Richard, dies. It is faced, additionally, with a possibility more troubling than any other—there are signs that Americans are moving in for a takeover. But this is not the only challenge confronting the British dug in at Nightingale Hart. An American executive is planning a personal visit. Given the described tenor of life in the place, he won’t lack for matters of interest to report."
