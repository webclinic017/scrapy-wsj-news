    "body": "As French President Emmanuel Macron won an unexpectedly comfortable re-election over Marine Le Pen, leaders throughout the West breathed sighs of relief. But a closer look at the results reveals reasons for concern, and raises an intriguing question: Can what Mr. Macron has done—create a new party of the center and lead it to victory—happen elsewhere, even in the U.S.?<br />The French presidential election of 2012 was the last traditional contest between center-left Socialists, the heirs of François Mitterrand, and center-right Republicans, the heirs of Charles de Gaulle. François Hollande, the Socialist, won 28.6% of the vote in the first round, followed by the Republican Nicolas Sarkozy with 27.2%. Taken together, these parties of the center commanded a sizable majority of the electorate. Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Front received 17.9%, and Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the leader of the far-left, 11.1%, combining for only 29%."
