    "body": "Trading desks at Wall Street banks look set to keep delivering strong results, so long as their bosses give them the opportunity.<br />In the first quarter,  Goldman Sachs  and  Morgan Stanley  both grew trading revenue 4% from a year earlier. Trading revenue at  Citigroup  and  JPMorgan Chase  was down just 2% and 3%, respectively. Given some of the gloomy forecasts for trading earlier this year, and the difficult comparison with a very strong quarter in the year-earlier period, it seems that Marchâ€™s market recovery had a big effect."
