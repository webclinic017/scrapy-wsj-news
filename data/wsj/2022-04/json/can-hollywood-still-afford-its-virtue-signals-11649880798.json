    "body": "In a perfect progressive world, the costs of phony virtue signals like pretending that police represent the main threat to city residents are not supposed to be borne by the wealthy signalers. Theoretically they have the means to insulate themselves from the consequences of their ideological poses. But in Los Angeles no one is safe, not even the Hollywood elite. Kevin Rector reports in the Los Angeles Times:<br />Surging crime in Los Angeles and San Francisco has been victimizing people up and down the income scale since both cities decided to hire prosecutors who don’t like to prosecute. But instead of confronting the lawlessness in these cities, many San Francisco and L.A. pols have decided to spend much of their time condemning people in other states who don’t share their radical views on social issues and climate policy."
