    "body": "What if we could upload our consciousness to the cloud? What if strangers could access not just our pictures and videos, but our thoughts and memories? What if technology allowed us to feel and experience what others feel and experience? What if the final frontier of privacy—the division between one consciousness and another—was abolished entirely?<br />This is the breathless premise of Jennifer Egan’s internet novel “The Candy House,” which imagines a not-too-distant future in which our hyperconnected world of social-media sharing is extended to new, nauseating extremes. It opens in 2010 with Bix Bouton, the mega-famous founder of a social-media company called Mandala. Bix is anxiously roaming the streets of Manhattan, worried that he will never change the world again. Casting about for a new revolutionary idea, he wanders into a gathering of academics. This is apparently Bix’s research method. His first company drew on anthropological ideas that “exploded in his mind like ink from a squid, and made him very rich.” In his fresh plunge amongst thinkers and theorists, Bix learns about an experimental device that can “externalize animal consciousness.” Eureka! He monetizes it, creating Own Your Unconscious™, a new technology that allows users to upload their memories, gaining complete access to the contents of their minds."
