    "body": "“Maturity” is a bad word on Wall Street. But most anywhere else, it is a good thing.<br />Investors showed  Meta Platforms  a little respect Wednesday after the company said it was able to navigate the confluence of factors hammering online ad businesses lately at least according to plan.
