    "body": "The press is so determined to discredit the current Supreme Court that we could write an almost daily corrective. The latest effort is the claim that a five-Justice conservative majority is using its “shadow docket” to rule on cases without briefings or oral argument.<br />This week the Justices reinstated a Trump-era rule that sought to stop political abuse of the Clean Water Act (Louisiana v. American Rivers). The order, issued without an opinion, stayed what clearly looks like a mistaken ruling by a lower-court judge."
