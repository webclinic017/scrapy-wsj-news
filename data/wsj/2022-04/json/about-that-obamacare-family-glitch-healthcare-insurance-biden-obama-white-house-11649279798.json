    "body": "The Affordable Care Act has faded into the political background since Republicans failed to repeal the entitlement in 2017, but ObamaCare still doesn’t work as promised. The Biden Administration said this week that it will throw more money at one problem, and the result will be to hook more Americans on government subsidies.<br />The Administration’s proposed new rule would eliminate what is known as the “family glitch.” The question is who qualifies for subsidies to buy ObamaCare. A person is eligible if he doesn’t have an offer of “affordable” coverage at work, defined as one that costs less than roughly 10% of household income. But the calculation is tethered to the cost of insuring only the worker, not the spouse and kids, and a family plan can be more expensive."
