    "body": "Music fundraisers are nothing new. They pop up almost every time a worthy cause comes along. But the recent outpouring of musical events to benefit Ukraine appears unprecedented in scope.<br />In Cleveland the top ticket went for $1,000, while in Ashfield, Mass., it was only $20. In New York City, the music was opera, but in Dallas country was on the bill. The common theme in these and dozens of other diverse performances was to raise money for Ukraine in its desperate time of need."
