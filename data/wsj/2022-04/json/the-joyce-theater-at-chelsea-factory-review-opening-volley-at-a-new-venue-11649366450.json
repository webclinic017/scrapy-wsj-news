    "body": "New York<br />For its inaugural season, through April 16, in partnership with the recently opened Chelsea Factory—a cultural space supporting New York-based artists and community organizations—the Joyce Theater is presenting two-night appearances of four different dance programs there. The Factory’s flexible facilities provide an especially intimate setting for dance, with the part used by the Joyce configured for 130 seats for this opening stint. This contrasts with the Joyce Theater’s longstanding, 472-seat space in a converted movie house some eight blocks away, which will continue to operate and opened in 1982."
