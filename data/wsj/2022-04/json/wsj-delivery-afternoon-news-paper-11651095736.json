    "body": "Regarding Peter Funt’s op-ed “The Last of the Afternoon Newspapers” (April 20), I salute John Sullivan and his two afternoon newspapers in southwest Montana and chastise those who didn’t look hard enough to find the Argus-Press in Owosso, Mich. Our readers enjoy getting their local news sometimes on the same day it happens.<br />Our roots date back to 1854 and the newspaper has been owned by the Campbell family since 1895. In my 40 years at the paper, we’ve held up production many times, most notably for jarring stories. The Challenger explosion and the 9/11 attacks were two terrible mornings, but by the end of those days we were the only newspaper in the state to have those stories delivered to its readers."
