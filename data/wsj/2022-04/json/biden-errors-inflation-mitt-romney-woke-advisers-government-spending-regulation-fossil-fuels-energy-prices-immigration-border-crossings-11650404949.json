    "body": "Three factors combined during the past two years to create the perfect economic storm. Covid-19 scrambled the U.S. economy’s supply lines. The Federal Reserve kept its foot on the accelerator way too long. And the Biden administration did pretty much everything wrong, injecting $1.9 trillion into a supply-constrained economy, sending out stay-at-home checks, letting tenants live rent-free, squeezing oil and gas production, launching an avalanche of growth-killing regulations, lining up behind unions, and pushing yet another deficit-financed budget.<br />Most Americans are having a hard time making ends meet. It’s past time for the Fed to restore its singular focus on monetary stability and leave social policies to the branches of government that are elected by the people. And the Biden administration must stop nominating doves to the Fed. The central bank needs hard-nosed economists."
