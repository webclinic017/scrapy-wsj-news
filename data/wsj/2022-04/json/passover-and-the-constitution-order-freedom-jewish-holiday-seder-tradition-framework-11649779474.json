    "body": "On Friday after sundown, Jews everywhere will gather in their homes to observe Passover. No doubt familiar themes will be discussed—the liberation from oppression in Egypt, the importance of memory, the duty to hand the story down from parents and grandparents to children, and—as the late Rabbi Jonathan Sacks emphasized—the art of asking questions.<br />This year, as I prepare for the arrival of my extended family, something new has struck me. The focus of this Jewish holiday, more than any other, is freedom. Indeed, Passover is called the “festival of freedom.” But the celebration of the holiday is called the Seder, which is Hebrew for “order.” We are required not only to do the right things but to do them in the right sequence. Our conversation always returns to what we must do and when we must do it."
