    "body": "I agree that many patients skip paying deductibles and copays because there are few consequences compared with other bills (Letters, April 1). But there is a deeper problem. Copays and deductibles originate from contracts between the patient and the insurance company. Why physicians are the collection agency for the insurance company is a mystery to me. Further, physicians have contracts with insurance companies to be paid a set amount for a set service. That these payments are discounted by copays and deductibles is unfair. If the insurers would collect copays and deductibles, patients would feel more impetus to pay. The consequences of canceled insurance coverage would be more motivating. This would relieve some of the pressure that leads to higher healthcare costs.<br />Marc S. Posner, M.D."
