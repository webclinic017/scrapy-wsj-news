    "body": "According to the latest federal data, 1,750 children died in 2020 as a result of being abused or neglected. Of those children, 34.9% were black, though blacks make up only 13% of the U.S. population. Black children were three times as likely to die from maltreatment as white children, and the number had gone up 17% from the year before.<br />These are not the racial disparities that concern Dorothy Roberts. A law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Ms. Roberts has long argued that the disproportionate danger to black children in this country comes not from abusive parents or other caretakers but from the child welfare system itself. In “Torn Apart,” she says that, just as it is time to end the “prison industrial complex,” it is time to eliminate the public agencies charged with detecting which children are in danger and, if necessary, removing them from the situation that threatens them, sometimes placing them in foster care."
