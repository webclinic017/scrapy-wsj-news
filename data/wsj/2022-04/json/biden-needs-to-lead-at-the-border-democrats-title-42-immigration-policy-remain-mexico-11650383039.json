    "body": "As someone who wishes the Biden administration well, I’d like to be able to support its immigration policy on the merits. But I can’t, because the policy has been a mess from day one, and the American people know it. The RealClearPolitics polling average on immigration puts public approval at a miserable 35% and disapproval at 59%.<br />The latest problem concerns Title 42 of the Public Health Code, which delegates to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the authority to restrict entry into the U.S. during a public-health emergency. The Trump administration used this provision aggressively during the pandemic to prevent most migrants from remaining in the U.S. To the distress of immigration advocates, the Biden administration has continued to enforce it—until now."
