    "body": "I would like to suggest an eleventh point to add to Bradley Smith’s op-ed “10 Things for Elon Musk to Do at Twitter” (April 8). That would be to remove Parag Agrawal as  Twitter  CEO.<br />Mr. Agrawal has been quoted as saying: “Our role is not to be bound by the First Amendment, but our role is to serve a healthy public conversation.” He thinks that Twitter should thus “focus less on thinking about free speech, but thinking about how the times have changed.” The Constitution has not changed, and it is still the law of the land, fundamental to our democracy. Moreover, what Mr. Agrawal means by “healthy public conversation” is that only what he and his staff want to hear is not banned."
