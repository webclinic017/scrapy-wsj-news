    "body": "Your editorial “John Kerry Says the Darndest Things” (April 23) completely distorts the meaning, context and reality, not only of my argument, but of what the private sector is already doing. Natural gas is central to a smart and achievable policy to cut greenhouse-gas emissions today. In the near term, that means pairing with renewables to clean up electricity. In the next decade, it also means abating emissions from gas itself.<br />Industry sees this as an opportunity, not a “death sentence.” American oil and gas CEOs have said they see carbon capture as a $3 trillion to $5 trillion industry by 2050. As the country moves to 100% clean power by 2035, American companies lead on technologies to produce emission-free electricity with gas. There are immense job opportunities in the gas industry’s transition to net zero. Don’t take my word for it; look at the industry’s investments."
