    "body": "Early signs indicate that consumers are beginning to rein in spending as prices rise. The good news for companies like  Nestlé  is that household essentials are lower down the list for cuts.<br />On Thursday, the world’s biggest-food company said sales increased by 7.6% in the three months through March compared with a year ago. The growth was made up of a 5.2% rise in prices, the highest level since 2008, and a 2.4% increase in the amount and mix of goods sold. This shows that consumers aren’t yet trimming how much they buy as prices increase. The trend was particularly striking in North America, where Nestlé’s prices shot up by 8.5% but volumes were still positive in the quarter."
