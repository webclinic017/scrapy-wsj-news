    "body": "Don Winslow’s latest combustible crime chronicle, “City on Fire,” takes place in Providence, R.I., in the 1980s. Here a crew of Irish crooks and a family of Italian criminals maintain a cooperative business arrangement; they conduct their affairs in the watchful shadow of Boston and New York syndicates who would love to take over their operations.<br />All is copacetic until one of the Italians shows up with a beautiful realtor from Connecticut, and one of the Irish makes a crude pass at her. What starts as a squabble becomes a violent clash, and then a war of opportunistic rivals."
