    "body": "When Melissa Buck first heard the Supreme Court’s verdict in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia last June, she was thrilled. Claiming that Catholic Social Services was violating the city’s nondiscrimination ordinance in foster care, Philadelphia had ended its contract with the agency. The justices ruled that Philadelphia was burdening religious exercise by forcing the agency “either to curtail its mission or to certify same-sex couples as foster parents in violation of its religious beliefs.”<br />When she saw that the decision was unanimous, Ms. Buck says, “I broke down crying. You can’t have the message be any more clear. We need to respect religious liberty and child welfare and the rights of those kids.”"
