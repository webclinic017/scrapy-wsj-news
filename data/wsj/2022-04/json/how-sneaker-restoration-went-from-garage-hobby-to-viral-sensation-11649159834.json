    "body": "At beauty supply stores such as  Sally Beauty ,  you can buy a hydrogen peroxide solution by Salon Care for around $15. Though intended as a hair-lightening product, it has recently been discovered by a community with no particular interest in hair: sneaker restorers, who use the concentrated cream to return old, yellowed  Nike  and Adidas soles (which turn sallow from years of light exposure) back to their original pearly-white hue.<br />In any number of YouTube videos and TikTok clips, these footwear surgeons espouse the decolorizing wonders of Salon Care’s hair cream. This new breed of craftspeople will also salvage suedes, repaint scuffed heels and, when necessary, swap out crumbling soles for new ones, all to bring decrepit, decades-old sneakers back from the brink of death."
