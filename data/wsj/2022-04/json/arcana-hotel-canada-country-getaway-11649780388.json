    "body": "A NEW OUTFIT called Arcana offers just two cabins, which are designed, the website promises, somewhat eerily, “to return you to the wild as a place, but also the wild as a state of mind.” And where exactly is this wild place? The website pointedly conceals the location, allowing only that it’s about a two-hour drive from Toronto. Once you book your stay, you’re sent a link to a Google map.<br />Even after I got my link, the red dot representing Arcana—in a forest in southwestern Ontario—didn’t seem to actually be anywhere; it was more between places, down a drive that was off an unnamed road off another unnamed road. When you get to the dot, it is indeed a sort of non-place, free of signs, the gravel drive almost entirely consumed by the exuberant ferns, tall grasses and low-hanging conifers that almost made me miss the low-slung wooden gate."
