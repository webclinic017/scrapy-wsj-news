    "body": "California is a mess and Gov. Gavin Newsom is sending treats to its citizens. It has the nation’s highest gasoline prices—over $6 a gallon for premium. The Western States Petroleum Association explains, “The first $1.27 a gallon we pay at the pump now is for taxes and regulatory programs.” Pretty easy to fix, but not for Mr. Newsom, who proposed, Oprah-like, sending Californians $400 gas-tax-rebate debit cards: You get a card. You get a card. Everybody gets a card!<br />The Legislature may vote on it this week. Of course, $400 is barely a month of fill-ups for many commuters. California, which has the fifth-largest oil reserves of any U.S. state, should have some of the cheapest gas in the country. Plus, Mr. Newsom’s gift cards aren’t really a gas-tax rebate. Electric-vehicle owners, who don’t buy gas, get a card too, even though they already get up to a third off their electricity bill via California’s Home Charging EV2-A electricity rate."
