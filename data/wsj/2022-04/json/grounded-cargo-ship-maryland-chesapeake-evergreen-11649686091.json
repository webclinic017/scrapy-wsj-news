    "body": "PASADENA, Md.—Linda Miller made a beeline to the end of a fishing pier and trained her marine binoculars on a giant container ship 2 miles offshore in the Chesapeake Bay. As usual, it wasn’t moving an inch.<br />The 1,095-foot Ever Forward has been making a mockery of its name since March 13, when it strayed out of a Baltimore-area shipping channel and plowed so deep in the silty bay bottom that two refloating attempts haven’t budged it. A third is under way, the Coast Guard said."
