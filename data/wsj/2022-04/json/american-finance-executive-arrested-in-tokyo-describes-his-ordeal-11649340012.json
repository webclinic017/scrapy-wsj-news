    "body": "TOKYO—Trevor Hill was sitting down to a takeout dinner with his wife on their moving day into an empty-nester apartment when prosecutors showed up at his door. The 51-year-old American, a rare foreigner to make it to the top ranks of a Japanese brokerage in Tokyo, knew authorities were looking into some trades in his unit. But he had no idea what was about to hit him.<br />Within hours, Mr. Hill was under arrest, taken to a Tokyo jail to be interrogated without a lawyer present and turned into the subject of wall-to-wall national media coverage. Prosecutors accused Mr. Hill and traders working for him at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. of a market-manipulation scheme. In an echo of the frenzy over former auto titan Carlos Ghosn’s arrest, Japanese media depicted it as one of the most serious financial offenses of this century."
