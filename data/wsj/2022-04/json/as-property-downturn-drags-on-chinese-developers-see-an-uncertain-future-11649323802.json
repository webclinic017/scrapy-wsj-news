    "body": "HONG KONGâ€”After suffering through a bruising property-market downturn, the Chinese developers still standing are predicting a starkly different future from their hard-charging days of the past.<br />Last week, at least two dozen Chinese real-estate companies whose shares trade in Hong Kong failed to file audited financial results for 2021 by a March 31 deadline, according to data compiled by CreditSights,  Nomura  and a review of exchange filings. Those developers that managed to do so painted a sober picture of their challenges as new home sales continue to decline, selling prices tumble and funding remains hard to come by."
