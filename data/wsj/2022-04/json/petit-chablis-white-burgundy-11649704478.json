    "body": "THE REFERENCE BOOK “Larousse Wine” describes Petit Chablis as “lighter, with fewer flavours than Chablis...but it’s cheaper!” Does that sound like a wine you’d want to drink?<br />Perhaps the fact that Petit Chablis is treated like a “lesser” version of Chablis by some wine professionals is the reason it’s so little talked about among regular wine drinkers. It’s a wine as summarily dismissed as it is overlooked. Yet after tasting iterations from some top producers, I’m convinced that this wine warrants greater respect and maybe a much better moniker, too."
