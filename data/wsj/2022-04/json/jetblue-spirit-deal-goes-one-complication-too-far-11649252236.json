    "body": "In airline mergers as in acrobatic flying, some maneuvers are too difficult for comfort.<br />Late Tuesday, the race to acquire Florida-based  Spirit Airlines  heated up when  JetBlue Airways announced an all-cash purchase proposal worth $3.6 billion, or $33 a share. This tops the cash-and-stock deal offered by Frontier Group back in February, which based on Mondayâ€™s market close would pay about $24 a share."
