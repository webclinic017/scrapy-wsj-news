    "body": "Investors don’t know precisely what will happen when the Federal Reserve cuts its massive Treasury and mortgage-backed security holdings. But they know that they don’t like it.<br />In minutes from last month’s rate-setting meeting, released Wednesday, Fed policy makers signaled a plan to start shrinking the central bank’s asset portfolio, a process known as quantitative tightening, as soon as their next gathering in May. Moreover, with inflation high and the job market tight, the minutes also showed policy makers are inclined to reduce the Fed’s $9 trillion balance sheet at a much more rapid pace than they did during the quantitative-tightening round that began in October 2017, when inflation was much cooler and the unemployment rate was higher."
