    "body": "New York<br />There is a reason that the 1964 musical “Funny Girl,” a hit on Broadway and a blockbuster movie, has never seen a major revival, and it doesn’t take a forensic scientist to unearth it. As much, if not more, than any musical, the show is indelibly associated with its original star, Barbra Streisand, around whom it was molded, if not shrink-wrapped, after she was cast. And as anyone who has watched her career knows—and most are at least aware of its contours—Ms. Streisand is a talent as singular as any in American popular culture."
