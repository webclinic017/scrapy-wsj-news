    "body": "The world’s oldest, and largest, carbon market has finally come of age.<br />After a rocky start in life, the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) has proven its mettle. EU carbon dioxide emission credits now trade around €80 for a metric ton, equivalent to $87. Since the start of 2020, prices have touched a low of €15 a metric ton and a high of €96. That is a wide range, but it has been a testing time for energy markets generally with the pandemic, the European energy crisis and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The carbon market, and its regulators, have weathered it all with aplomb."
