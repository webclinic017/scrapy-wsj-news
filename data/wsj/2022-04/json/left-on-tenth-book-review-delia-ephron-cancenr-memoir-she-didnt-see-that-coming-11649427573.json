    "body": "The first 100 pages of Delia Ephron’s memoir “Left on Tenth” have the makings of a bittersweet romantic comedy: 70-something woman, recently widowed, gets a second chance at love thanks to an out-of-the-blue email. It could be a senior citizens’ “Sleepless in Seattle,” the 1993 comedy co-written by Ms. Ephron’s older sister, Nora. Or perhaps a twist on “You’ve Got Mail,” Nora and Delia’s 1998 collaboration. Then “Left on Tenth” takes a harrowing turn.<br />But first things first. By June 2015, it had become clear to Ms. Ephron, a novelist and essayist, that her screenwriter-husband, Jerry Kass, was dying. The prostate cancer he’d battled for a decade had spread to his bones, and she began rehearsing for life without him. Returning to the couple’s Manhattan apartment after coffee with a friend—the “Tenth” of the book’s title refers to Ms. Ephron’s street in Greenwich Village—“I’d tell myself ‘Imagine you are coming home and Jerry isn’t there.’ ”"
