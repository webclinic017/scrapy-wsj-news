    "body": "Ryan Stasik, a bass player for the band Umphrey’s McGee living in Charleston, S.C., on his 1979 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am, as told to A.J. Baime.<br />In 2012, my wife and I found out that we were pregnant and we needed to jump ship from living in a high-rise in Chicago. We had family in Charleston and the beach was calling us. So we moved. One day in the summer of 2013, I was getting my golf clubs refit and waiting for the guy behind the counter, who was on the phone. I overheard two guys talking about collecting cars. If you know me, you know it’s hard for me to not join a conversation."
