    "body": "Does inflation increase wealth? That is the contention of some economists and business journalists who should know better. Inflation has a silver lining for economic welfare, they claim, or price increases are good for the economy as a whole.<br />The argument in a nutshell is that inflation induces newly impoverished retirees back into the labor force. Their work increases gross domestic product, and we will all benefit from the increased goods and services it creates. So too for those who put off retirement, unable to afford it because of inflation."
