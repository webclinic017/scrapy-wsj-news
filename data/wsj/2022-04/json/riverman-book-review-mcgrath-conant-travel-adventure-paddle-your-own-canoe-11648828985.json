    "body": "In 1959 the writer Joseph Mitchell profiled a Hudson River shad fisherman in an article for the New Yorker called “The Rivermen.” He wrote: “Some men work full time on the river—on ferries, tugs, or barges—and are not considered rivermen; they are simply men who work on the river. Other men work only part of the year on the river and make only a part of their living there but are considered rivermen.”<br />Ben McGrath’s superb first book, “Riverman: An American Odyssey,” expands on two articles he wrote for the New Yorker about a man who paddled thousands of miles down America’s rivers in plastic canoes over many years, navigating mainly with road atlases. But Dick Conant did not make a cent on his solo journeys. In fact, that was part of his appeal for Mr. McGrath, who was drawn to this unusual adventurer who, refreshingly, was not trying to raise funds or set records."
