    "body": "We told you a week ago that a Los Angeles judge blocked California’s corporate board diversity mandate, albeit without filing an opinion. It turns out Superior Court Judge Terry Green did file a 24-page opinion, though it wasn’t posted on the court’s website until after our editorial was published. We’re happy to recount his logic since politicians in Sacramento are clearly in need of legal instruction.<br />The Legislature’s premise for its diversity mandate was that corporate directors tend to select replacements who look like them, resulting in homogenous boards. Ergo, all public companies headquartered in the state were ordered to include at least one member of an “underrepresented” race, ethnicity or sexual orientation, and two to three for larger boards."
