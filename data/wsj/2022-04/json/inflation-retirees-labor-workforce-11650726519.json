    "body": "In his op-ed “There’s More to Wealth Than Work” (April 21), Walter E. Block invites us to expand our definition of the economy to include more than maximizing gross domestic product. The definition should include the dichotomy of labor-leisure, he thinks. For inflation to pull people out of leisure and force them to work once again is not good.<br />On an individual level, that may be true: If you work only to retire, then you may resent having to work again. At a societal level, however, retirees’ return to work may be very good. Older workers have legacy knowledge and skills that are often lost with early retirements. Instead of golf and cruises, these retirees will once again contribute their efforts to increasing productivity. That’s good for society. Plus, work can be its own reward, contributing purpose that amorphous living often does not."
