    "body": "Editor’s note: In this Future View, students discuss standardized testing. Next week we’ll ask, “Recent Pew surveys have suggested that 40% of adults 25 to 54 are neither married nor living with a partner. Fully half of single adults are no longer looking for a relationship. Even sexual activity has reached a 30-year low. Should the culture combat these trends? Do you plan to form a family?” Students should click here to submit opinions of fewer than 250 words before April 19. The best responses will be published that night.<br />"
