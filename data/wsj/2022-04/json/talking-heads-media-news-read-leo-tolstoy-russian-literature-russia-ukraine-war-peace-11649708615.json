    "body": "Television news programs often call on retired generals, colonels and the occasional lieutenant colonel to comment on the war in Ukraine. They opine, they speculate, they predict. None I have seen appears foolish, intemperate or unthoughtful. Yet not one I know of predicted the radical flaws in Russia’s military or the prowess and courage of the Ukrainian army and volunteers.<br />It’s a shame television news producers were unable to call in a retired Russian lieutenant who fought in the Crimean War and was on hand for the nearly year-long siege of Sevastopol in 1854-55—a fellow named Leo Tolstoy. He could have set us all straight on how difficult it is to discuss war, an irrational enterprise, on entirely rational terms. “Man cannot achieve more than a certain insight into the correlation between the life of the bee and other manifestations of life,” Tolstoy wrote toward the close of “War and Peace.” “And the same is true with regard to the final purpose of historical characters and nations.”"
