    "body": "China’s  Cnooc Ltd.  surged on its Shanghai trading debut, after the country’s largest offshore producer of crude oil and natural gas raised about $4.4 billion in one of this year’s biggest share sales.<br />The listing comes months after Cnooc was kicked off the New York Stock Exchange, and follows similar deals by two of China’s largest telecommunications operators that were also ejected from U.S. stock markets. In total, the three state-backed companies have raised about $20 billion from Chinese onshore investors, showing they still have access to abundant funding."
