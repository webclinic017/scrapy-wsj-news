    "body": "Jason Riley is right that Black Lives Matter’s popularity has declined since its 2020 peak and that news “about the organization’s spending habits” will make things worse (“BLM’s Antipolice Racket is Coming Undone,” Upward Mobility, April 20). And there’s more. The IRS doesn’t know where millions raised in 2020 have gone. California and Washington, no bastions of conservatism, have suspended fundraising by the group’s flagship, the BLM Global Network Foundation, because it is delinquent on its 2020 financial reports.<br />But the foundation’s biggest problem has never been the grift. Nor has it been that its self-avowed Marxist founders have gone on a mansion-buying spree with money well-intentioned Americans and craven corporations donated."
