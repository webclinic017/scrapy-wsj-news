    "body": "We are rationing healthcare. The reason is not a shortage of beds, drugs, ventilators or surgical suites. It is a shortage of healthcare personnel.<br />As with other parts of the American economy, healthcare has stretched its workforce to its limit. Doctors, nurses, administrators, respiratory therapists and others have been in emergency mode for much of the past two years. Unpredictable surges of Covid-19 still threaten to increase the workload and sideline workers. No wonder there is tremendous burnout. People are quitting, causing serious workforce shortages and compromising medical care."
