    "body": "Elon Musk’s cryptic tweets have suggested he might escalate his $43 billion bid for  Twitter  by launching a tender offer to buy the social-media company. The tweets make apparent references to Elvis Presley’s hit song “Love Me Tender” and F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel “Tender Is The Night.”<br />Twitter is expected in the coming days to reject Mr. Musk’s $54.20-a-share bid as too low. If that really was Mr. Musk’s “best and final” offer, as he has said, a tender offer would be his next-best option. He has confirmed he is exploring that route."
