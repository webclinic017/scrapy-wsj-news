    "body": "American consumers’ leisure lives are working hard for card companies right now.<br />American Express  on Friday reported that spending on its cards for travel-and-entertainment just about matched the prepandemic 2019 level in March. While large corporate travel spending and international consumers still aren’t back to those levels, U.S. consumers aren’t being held back by the state of the world these days and helped lead the recovery: In the first quarter they spent 20% more on T&E, adjusted for exchange rate moves, than in the same quarter of 2019, AmEx reported."
