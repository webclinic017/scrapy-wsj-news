    "body": "Few takeovers in the history of English soccer have been more complicated than the forced sale of Chelsea Football Club. Pressed onto the market after its billionaire owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the U.K. government for his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the team immediately drew interest from investors around the world, all hoping to leap on of soccerâ€™s glitziest brands.<br />But for all the twists of government involvement, a military conflict in Ukraine, and a protracted bidding war, the process appears to be heading for what has become the most familiar Premier League outcome: a marquee club landing under American control."
