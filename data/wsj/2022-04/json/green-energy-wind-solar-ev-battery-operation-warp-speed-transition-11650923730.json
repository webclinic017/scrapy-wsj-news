    "body": "Choose any dramatic government-sponsored technical program—the Manhattan Project, the Apollo Program and so forth—and people will want to apply it to alternative “green” energy: In “What Global Warming Has in Common With Covid,” (op-ed, April 13), Tomas Philipson writes, “The Biden administration needs an Operation Warp Speed for green-energy alternatives.”<br />I am sympathetic to some of Mr. Philipson’s ideas: spurring private innovation and removing regulatory barriers. But the problems of an energy transition are at most superficially like those of Covid, and the differences are vast."
