    "body": "After “Diner,” “Rain Man,” “The Natural,” “Bugsy,” “Bandits” and that mischievous landmine “Wag the Dog,” Barry Levinson deserves the benefit of the doubt. It’s safe to assume that he knows what he’s doing, and where he’s going, even if your initial instinct might be to run in the opposite direction.<br />It’s like that with “The Survivor”—a title that seems presumptuous, even provocative. The term is synonymous with those who survived the Nazi horrors of World War II. The film is about a Jew who lived through the Holocaust. But why the survivor? The title makes some sense, if you consider that the history of its real-life subject, Harry Haft (Ben Foster), is a provocation, too."
