    "body": "David de Jong’s “Nazi Billionaires: The Dark History of Germany’s Wealthiest Dynasties” is a provocative group portrait of five industrialists who expanded their fortunes by colluding with Hitler and then, after World War II, walked away with minimal punishment and barely a dent in their bottom lines. Today these dynasties are worth billions.<br />“Over the past fifty years,” Mr. de Jong writes, “German political leaders haven’t shied away from taking moral responsibility and acknowledging the sins of the past,” not least the atrocities perpetrated during the Nazi regime. Not so these five dynasties, which, over time and across generations, Mr. de Jong tells us, have deflected or excused themselves from accountability. They have obfuscated their connections to companies that armed and fed the soldiers of the Third Reich; that used slave laborers from Nazi concentration and prisoner-of-war camps; or that were acquired through Aryanization—the Nazi euphemism for the forced takeover of Jewish-owned businesses for a pittance of their worth. In this meticulously researched book, Mr. de Jong, an investigative journalist and former reporter at Bloomberg News, compels us to confront the current-day legacy of these Nazi ties."
