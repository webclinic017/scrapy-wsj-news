    "body": "For the past year, investors have been worried that rising costs might start putting a big drag on companies’ earnings. It looks as if that happened in the first quarter.<br />Analyst estimates now put first-quarter earnings per share at companies in the S&P 500 at 6.4% ahead of their year-earlier level, according to Refinitiv. Net income, which doesn’t include the flattering effects of companies’ share count reductions, is estimated to be up a more modest 4.3%."
