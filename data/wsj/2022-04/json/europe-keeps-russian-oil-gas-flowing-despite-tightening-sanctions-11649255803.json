    "body": "Six weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, the European Union is taking its first steps to reduce Russian energy imports, depriving Moscow of some of the revenue that covers much of its budget and helps fund its military campaign.<br />But the EU can’t agree to sanction the bloc’s biggest business dealings with Russia: the purchase of oil and natural gas. The EU, which imports around 60% of its energy needs, is making large payments to Russia, boosted by higher oil-and-gas prices during the war."
