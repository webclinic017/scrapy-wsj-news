    "body": "“IF WE’RE KNOWN for a salad, this is it,” chef Mason Hereford said of the blue-cheese wedge he serves at Turkey and the Wolf in New Orleans. In his third Slow Food Fast recipe, Mr. Hereford offers a streamlined version of “The Wedge,” as it’s called in his forthcoming cookbook. But all the key elements are here: crisp iceberg lettuce, a scrumptious buttermilk blue cheese dressing, cherry tomatoes, warm bacon bits, fresh dill. An everything-bagel topping adds crunch.<br />“The thing we didn’t know when we were first testing was just how much everything-bagel topping this can take,” Mr. Hereford said. “And it can take A LOT. We pack it on!” He does not recommend buying the everything-bagel seasoning pre-jarred, however. “You can’t control the salt level and balance,” he said. His own potent mix includes poppy seeds, sesame seeds, and dried garlic and onion. “I’m not big on subtle flavors,” the chef said. “I have no restraint.”"
