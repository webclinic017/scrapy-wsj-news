    "body": "Would you be surprised to learn that Jesus was really a cross-dressing, gender-indeterminate “drag king”? If so, you obviously don’t know the variant of critical theory called “queer theory” as expounded by Tat-siong Benny Liew, a religious-studies professor at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass., who gave this subversive reading of the Gospels in an essay published in a collection of biblical criticism.<br />It is a cliché among academics that the humanities are in crisis. According to Harvard historian James Hankins, part of the problem is the dominance of “critical” reading over “primary” reading. Primary reading takes a text at face value and simply tries to understand what the author intended to say. Critical reading assumes an author’s statements—in the Bible or anything else—can never be taken at face value. Instead, they must be “seen through” to expose the text’s real meaning, which is determined in accord with this or that fashionable theory."
