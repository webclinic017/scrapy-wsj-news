    "body": "The business of global banking can get very complicated, but sometimes it is also pretty simple: A good economy will be good for banks.<br />JPMorgan Chase’s net interest income—a basic measure of the interest the bank earns, less the interest it pays for funding—was up 8% from a year earlier, the bank said in its first-quarter earnings report on Wednesday. That number should continue to rise as interest rates do, but for now the bank declined to update its earlier forecast for 2022 net interest income, excluding the more volatile trading unit’s contribution, to be $53 billion-plus."
