    "body": "Sometimes, cyclicality works in  Apple ’s  favor.<br />The tech giant that makes iPhones, iPads and Mac computers is well accustomed to slow summers. The third fiscal quarter ending in June is typically the company’s weakest in sales, thanks mostly to its pattern of launching new iPhones in the fall. And this year’s June quarter may be even weaker, given Covid-driven lockdowns in China that have shuttered some of the factories that produce Apple’s products."
