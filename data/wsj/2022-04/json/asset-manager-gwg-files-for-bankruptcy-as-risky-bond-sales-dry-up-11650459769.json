    "body": "GWG  Holdings Inc., an alternative asset manager known for selling life-insurance bonds to retail investors, filed for bankruptcy Wednesday after accounting issues and the resignation of its auditor prevented it from continuing to sell its products.<br />Dallas-based GWG created financial instruments called L Bonds, which pooled money from bond investors to purchase life-insurance policies on the secondary market, aiming to use payouts from the policies when people die to repay the investors. The company enters chapter 11 with more than $1.6 billion of L Bonds outstanding, mostly owned by individual investors who bought them after hearing a sales pitch from regional broker-dealers who sold the bonds on GWGâ€™s behalf."
