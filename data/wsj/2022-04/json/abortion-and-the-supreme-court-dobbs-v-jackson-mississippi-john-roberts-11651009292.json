    "body": "The Supreme Court will soon decide an abortion case in which Mississippi has asked the Justices to overturn Roe v. Wade. The oral argument suggested that five Justices lean toward doing so, but a ferocious lobbying campaign is trying to change their minds.<br />The campaign may be the most apocalyptic in its warnings since the ObamaCare case in 2012. Democrats are demanding that Justice Clarence Thomas resign because of the political activism of his wife. The New Yorker published a long piece portraying Justice Amy Coney Barrett as almost a religious cultist."
