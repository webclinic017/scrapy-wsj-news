    "body": "Amazon ’s  dominance in e-commerce is unparalleled, but traditional retailer  Walmart  has been gaining ground for years. That script was flipped in India last week, as Amazon followed in the footsteps of a Walmart-owned domestic rival to enter the burgeoning social-commerce space by making a small acquisition.<br />Amazon’s delayed entry into the space underscores the competitive intensity of the India market, where companies are constantly looking for newer ways to sell. For Amazon, which is facing increased competition not only from Walmart but local giants  Reliance Industries  and Tata Group, a little more aggression to enter newer areas in the world’s second-largest internet market wouldn’t be unwarranted."
