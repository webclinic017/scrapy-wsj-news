    "body": "Walter Russell Mead writes that Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine “looks set to promote the emergence of a Europe that is militarily stronger and more deeply engaged with the U.S.” and is “making Germany more powerful, more activist and more Atlanticist” (“Putin’s War Unifies Europe,” Global View, March 29). But it is far too early to shoot off any celebratory fireworks.<br />Mr. Mead believes that changes will be profound if Berlin finally meets its NATO commitment to spend 2% of gross domestic product on national defense. Yet this is the same Germany that a few months ago could famously scrap together only a few hundred helmets to send to Ukraine in its defense. After years of neglect, it will take much longer and much more financial willpower than most people assume to build a locked-and-loaded German military."
