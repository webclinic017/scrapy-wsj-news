    "body": "America, meet Simpson, Fritsch, & Oppo—the country’s newest, if not its most prestigious, law firm. At least that’s what the purveyors of the Russia collusion hoax are now peddling to the judiciary, part of a last-ditch effort to conceal the truth of their actions.<br />Readers are familiar with Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch as the co-founders of Fusion GPS, the opposition-research firm hired by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (via law firm Perkins Coie) in 2016 to concoct the infamous “dossier” against Donald Trump. A grand jury impaneled by special counsel John Durham indicted Perkins Coie partner Michael Sussmann last year on a false-statement charge related to his effort to feed such dirt to the FBI. Mr. Sussmann pleaded not guilty."
