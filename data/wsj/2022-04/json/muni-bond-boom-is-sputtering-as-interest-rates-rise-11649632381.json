    "body": "Rising interest rates are threatening the municipal-bond boom on Wall Street, leaving governments less willing to borrow and households less willing to invest in the $4 trillion market.<br />Bond issuance by state and local governments dropped 8% in the first quarter from a year earlier, with public officials calling off refinancings and spending down stimulus cash. At the same time, spooked investors yanked their money from municipal-bond funds, which suffered their biggest quarterly outflows since 2013."
