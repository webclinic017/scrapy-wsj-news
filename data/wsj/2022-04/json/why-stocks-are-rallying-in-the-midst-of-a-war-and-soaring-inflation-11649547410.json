    "body": "Investors are confronting one of the most uncertain periods of their lifetimes. Stocks are rallying anyway.<br />The S&P 500 has rebounded 7.6% from its 2022 low on March 8, cutting its losses for the year to about 6%â€”roughly half of what they were weeks ago. In many ways, investors say, the rebound has been as broad as it has been impressive, lifting everything from travel stocks to utilities to unprofitable technology companies."
