    "body": "PARIS—Far-right leader Marine Le Pen is tapping public frustration over energy and food prices to close in on French President Emmanuel Macron before voters head to the polls on Sunday, a sign of how the war in Ukraine is rippling across Europe’s economic and political landscape.<br />In an attempt to quell public discontent, Mr. Macron has ordered a cap on electricity and natural-gas prices. He has also instituted a rebate on fuel and offered checks to low-income households to help them buy essentials."
