    "body": "The European Union is working to make its nine currencies available to the more than 3.5 million Ukrainian refugees now in the bloc, some of whom can’t pay for basic necessities because many EU banks aren’t converting their national currency, the hryvnia, into local currency.<br />European officials believe a substantial proportion of Ukrainians are arriving in the EU with hryvnia cash and without access to credit cards to pay for vital goods."
