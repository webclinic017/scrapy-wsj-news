    "body": "Donald Trump’s trade policy picked winners and losers among U.S. businesses and manufacturers. Now new evidence of the price hikes caused by his tariffs of 10% on aluminum imports—many of which the Biden Administration has left in place—comes from the U.S. beverage industry.<br />Citing national security with little evidence, President Trump used Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum from most countries in March 2018. Data calculated by Harbor Aluminum for the Beer Institute, to be released Thursday, show that U.S. beverage manufacturers have since paid an equivalent of $1.4 billion in Section 232 aluminum tariffs through February 2022."
