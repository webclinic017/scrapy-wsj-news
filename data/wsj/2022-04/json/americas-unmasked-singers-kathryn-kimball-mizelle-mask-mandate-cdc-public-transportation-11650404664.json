    "body": "Has there been a judicial ruling that yielded so much rejoicing nationwide as Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle’s on Monday vacating the federal mask mandate in public transportation? It wasn’t the end of Prohibition, but we’ll bet there was some drinking in more than a few places.<br />Spontaneous applause broke out in midair on some flights on the news. Several airlines immediately announced that masks are now optional, while Uber and  Lyft  dropped their mandates. New Jersey’s Phil Murphy, one of the most mandate-happy Governors, lifted the mask order on New Jersey Transit. New York is still insisting on masks on mass transit—of course—but many straphangers already wore their masks below their noses."
