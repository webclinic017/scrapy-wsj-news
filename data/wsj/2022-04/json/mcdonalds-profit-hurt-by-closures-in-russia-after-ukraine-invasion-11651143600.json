    "body": "McDonald’s Corp.’s  sales grew in its most recent quarter as it increased U.S. menu prices, but the closure of its 847 Russian restaurants has hurt the chain’s profit.<br />The Chicago-based burger chain reported net income of $1.1 billion for its quarter ended March 31, down 28% from last year’s period. The company said it incurred $127 million in costs in its first quarter related to the closure of its Russian market in response to the country’s invasion of Ukraine, with expenses coming from ongoing payment of staff salaries and unsold inventory."
