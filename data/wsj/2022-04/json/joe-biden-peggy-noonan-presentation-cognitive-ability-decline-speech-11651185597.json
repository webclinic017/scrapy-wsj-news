    "body": "In “Joe Biden Has a Presentation Problem” (Declarations, April 23), Peggy Noonan plays off Krylov’s “The Inquisitive Man,” taking note of all sorts of minutiae while ignoring the elephant in the room. The president is obviously struggling with cognitive issues. Whether he’s shaking hands with thin air, losing his train of thought or struggling with the teleprompter, one thing is clear: Even if he would like to take heed of Ms. Noonan’s advice, he is unable to do so.<br />Charles E. Ernst"
