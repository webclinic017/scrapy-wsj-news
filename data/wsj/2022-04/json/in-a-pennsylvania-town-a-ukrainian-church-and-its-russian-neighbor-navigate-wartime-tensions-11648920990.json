    "body": "CARNEGIE, Pa.—Two century-old churches—one Russian and one Ukrainian—sit next to each other on a main street in this small community outside of Pittsburgh, their respective blue and gold domes visible from afar.<br />The pastors have always been friendly, but now Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has called on them to work more closely to defuse tensions and maintain relations while their cultural homelands are at war. Whatever the outcome, the two priests will continue to support each other, saying they share the same theology."
