    "body": "The current custom in journalism holds that legislation sponsored by Democrats carries the title preferred by Democrats, while a Republican-sponsored bill carries the title preferred by Democrats. Therefore modern newsroom policy dictates that President Joe Biden’s desired assault on taxpayers shall be called “Build Back Better” but Florida’s new law shielding 7-year-olds from state-sponsored gender identity lectures must be labeled “Don’t Say Gay.”<br />This policy of granting exclusive legislative naming rights to one party is of course intended to influence rather than inform public debates. In the case of Florida the specific intent is to bully state officials into accepting that even reasonable measures to ensure age-appropriate education and parental involvement will be mischaracterized by journalists as unacceptable bigotry. A bedrock principle of contemporary media is that government employees must not be denied the right to emote about sexuality in front of kindergarten classrooms."
