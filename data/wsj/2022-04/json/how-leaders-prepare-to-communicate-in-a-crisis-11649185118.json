    "body": "The world has become quite sophisticated when it comes to preparing for disasters. Intelligence reports and law enforcement bulletins tell agencies what criminal or terror threats may be out there. The National Weather Service gives us a sense of when hurricanes or tornadoes are coming. New technology is giving residents even a few seconds warning about earthquakes. And after Covid, there is a movement to build a strong early-alert system for potential pandemics so that we arenâ€™t caught so flat-footed and can make decisions earlier and better.<br />We are less sophisticated when it comes to minimizing the consequences of a disaster after it happens. During a crisis, people look to their leaders for two things: numbers and hope. Whether you are a CEO, a government official, a teacher or a parent, when disaster strikes you need to be able to give people who depend on you basic data to guide their response and an empathetic acknowledgment that things are perilous but will get better."
