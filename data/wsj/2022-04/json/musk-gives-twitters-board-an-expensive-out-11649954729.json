    "body": "Some say money means never having to say you’re sorry. It also apparently means never having to entertain the indignity of a counteroffer.<br />Elon Musk’s offer to buy Twitter—made in a terse letter to  Twitter  Chairman Bret Taylor on Wednesday—reflects such thinking. The per-share price of $54.20 reflects a 51% premium over the stock’s 30-day average before Mr. Musk first reporting his interest in the company on April 4. It’s also 24% below what the stock was fetching less than a year ago, meaning the offer would normally—and rightfully—be considered an opener."
