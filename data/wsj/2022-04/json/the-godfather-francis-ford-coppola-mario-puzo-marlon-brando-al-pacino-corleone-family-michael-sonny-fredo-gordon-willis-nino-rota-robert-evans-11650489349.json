    "body": "Like a great Bordeaux, Francis Ford Coppola’s masterpiece “The Godfather,” which is 50 years old this year, has ripened and improved over time. Crime had traditionally been described by the movies, from “Little Caesar” to “The French Connection,” as something gritty, almost repellent. Yet here was a film that exalted the most ruthless of murders with the dramatic sweep of grand opera. More important, Mario Puzo’s saga created a vibrant range of personalities, from Don Corleone and his sons to the Mafia chieftains who oppose them.<br />Until Puzo’s novel “The Godfather” appeared in 1969, most Americans were unaware of the history of the Mafia. Gangsters took the form of Edward G. Robinson, James Cagney or even Humphrey Bogart. Puzo and Mr. Coppola had the inspiration to superimpose what could have been merely an unsavory saga on a well-tried matrix—that of a family and its feuds—from Shakespeare to “The Forsyte Saga” and beyond."
