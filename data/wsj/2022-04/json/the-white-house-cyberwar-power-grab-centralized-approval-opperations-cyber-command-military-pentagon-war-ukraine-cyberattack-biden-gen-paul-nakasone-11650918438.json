    "body": "To most onlookers, the U.S. appears to be in the midst of a successful cyber defense campaign against Russia. As Gen. Paul Nakasone, commander of U.S. Cyber Command, recently testified before Congress, the U.S. military is deploying military members to the region to sit “side by side with our partners.” Cyber Command has also “crafted options for national decision makers” and is “conducting operations as directed.” Yet at a pivotal time in Ukrainian cyber defense, the Biden administration is reportedly considering a proposal to take away Defense Department authorities to conduct offensive cyber operations and reinstate a centralized approval process from the White House. This would be a mistake.<br />All departments and agencies within the federal government operate under different authorities, delegated from the president through executive policies and from Congress through law. These define what an organization can and can’t do and when it needs to ask for permission. In a conflict or military campaign, the president (and sometimes Congress) delegates authorities to the Defense Department to conduct operations."
