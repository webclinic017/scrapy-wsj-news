    "body": "Donald Trump stirred the Pennsylvania primary pot this weekend, with his controversial endorsement of TV doctor Mehmet Oz over David McCormick to succeed Sen. Pat Toomey. If the press won’t let that go, it’s in part because Democrats are in denial about their own consequential contest—one that goes beyond Senate control to the question of their party’s future.<br />That’s the primary on their side, between Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and Rep. Conor Lamb. It pits an all but untested, unapologetic progressive firebrand against a centrist with a proven track record of beating Republicans in the swingiest of states. And it speaks volumes that—for now—the uber-liberal is running away with it."
