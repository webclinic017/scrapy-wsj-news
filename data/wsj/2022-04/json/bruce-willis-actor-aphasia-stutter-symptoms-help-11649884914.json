    "body": "Bob Greene gives readers a powerful education in “Bruce Willis and the Cruelty of Aphasia” (op-ed, April 1). Mr. Willis stuttered badly for the first 18 years of his life. After working so hard to overcome that, it is tragic that now aphasia has a grip on him.<br />The Stuttering Foundation has an article on Mr. Willis titled “Bruce Willis - Look Who’s Talking” that details the struggles of his early years. For 35 years, the actor has been a hero to the stuttering community. I have no doubt that he will now be a hero to those affected by aphasia, and educate the public about it, as he has done with stuttering."
