    "body": "Higher prices can make people think twice before buying. Especially when it comes to things they donâ€™t want as much as they used to.<br />The Commerce Department on Thursday said that retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in March from a month earlier. That was a tad less than the 0.6% gain that economists polled by The Wall Street Journal were looking for, but there were also revisions to the previous two months that brought the level of retail sales in February 0.7% higher than previously reported. On net, first-quarter consumer spending is looking stronger now."
