    "body": "Amazon . com has a rough summer ahead. Or at least a very busy one.<br />The e-commerce giant’s first-quarter results Thursday afternoon showed starkly the multipronged impact of rising costs and slowing demand in an inflationary environment. Total sales of $116.4 billion were up only 7% year-over-year—the company’s slowest growth rate in at least 12 years. That was in line with Wall Street’s estimates, but operating income of about $3.7 billion was 31% below analysts’ targets."
