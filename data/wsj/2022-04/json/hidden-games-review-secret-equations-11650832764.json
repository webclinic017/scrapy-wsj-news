Why did some snipers in World War I trenches intentionally miss their enemies? The answers, and more, can be found—who knew?—in mathematics. Specifically, in the mathematical models used in “game theory,” a rigorous approach to studying strategic interactions.<br />A few plain equations, it turns out, can shed light on a vast array of social phenomena—economic, political, moral and sexual. That doesn’t mean humans are simpletons. It means that, in everyday decisions, we can smartly simmer situations down to their most essential principles."
