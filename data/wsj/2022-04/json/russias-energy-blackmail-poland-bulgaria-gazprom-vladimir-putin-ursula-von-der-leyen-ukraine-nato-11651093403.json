    "body": "An attack on one NATO ally is an attack on all, and that’s how Europe and the U.S. should treat Russia’s decision this week to stop supplying natural gas to Poland and Bulgaria. With enough allied coordination, this could boomerang on Vladimir Putin.<br />The Kremlin is extorting Europe by demanding that “unfriendly” countries pay for gas in rubles rather than euros or dollars as required under their Gazprom contracts. European companies have been ordered to set up two accounts at Gazprombank to enable the currency conversion. Countries that refuse, as Bulgaria and Poland have, risk a gas cutoff."
