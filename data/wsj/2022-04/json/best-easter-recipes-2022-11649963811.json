    "body": "This spring celebration demands fresh, colorful dishes that delight everyone at the table, whether carnivore, vegan, chocolate-obsessed or strictly gluten-free. From an eggy Italian Easter bread to a spectacular leg of lamb, with plenty of green salads and vegetable dishes, plus festive cakes for dessert, all the recipes you need are right here.<br />The icon of the season is a must for the Easter table. This recipe for pane di pasqua, the Italian Easter bread, produces adorable mini brioche-style loaves studded with eggs dyed in your preferred shades of pastel. Egg whites give a grapefruit gin fizz cocktail a delightful airy consistency. This smoky tortilla with ham can be made before the guests arrive and served at room temperature, a blessing for the host. Begin the meal with a jammy egg and smoked trout salad with spring greens. And end with a gorgeous brown sugar Pavlova with lemon curd and yogurt whipped cream."
