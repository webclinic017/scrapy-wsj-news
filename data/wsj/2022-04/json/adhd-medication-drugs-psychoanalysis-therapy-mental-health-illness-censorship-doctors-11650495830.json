    "body": "In “For Mental Illness, Make Pills a Last Resort” (op-ed, April 5), Erica Komisar writes that ADHD results from trauma, loss and failed relationships but provides no evidence. I have practiced psychiatry for 53 years and have seen over 1,000 patients with ADHD. Almost all respond beautifully to medication. With gratitude, they report a huge improvement in focus, concentration and productivity.<br />Forget “last resort.” The main objective of psychiatric treatment should be to improve the quality of a patient’s life and reduce suffering—as quickly, effectively and durably as possible."
