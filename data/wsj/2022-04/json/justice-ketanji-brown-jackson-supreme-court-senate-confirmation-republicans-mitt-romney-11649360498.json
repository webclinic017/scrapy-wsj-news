    "body": "Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will soon be moving her office a few blocks across D.C., after the Senate confirmed her to the Supreme Court on Thursday in a 53-47 vote. Congratulations to the new Justice, although we hope she finds herself more influenced by her new colleagues than vice versa.<br />Three Republicans voted to confirm, Sens. Mitt Romney, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski. Liberals are griping that it should have been more. Oh? Only one Democrat, Joe Manchin, voted for Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Zero backed Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Where were the pleas for goodwill when Democrats preposterously called Judge Barrett a missile aimed at ObamaCare?"
