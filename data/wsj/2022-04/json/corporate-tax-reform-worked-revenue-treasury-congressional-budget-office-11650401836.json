    "body": "Democrats are still looking to raise $1.6 trillion in new taxes this year, and even Joe Manchin says heâ€™d support a corporate tax increase. The West Virginia Senator might reconsider if he looks at the actual revenue results of the 2017 tax reform that cut corporate tax rates. Reform has been a winner for the economy and federal tax coffers.<br />Remember the claims during the 2017 tax debate that reform would drain the Treasury, especially the cut in the corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%? Corporate revenue was supposed to fall to historic lows as a share of the economy. Big business supposedly got a windfall and government was robbed."
