    "body": "For all the obstacles  Microsoft  still faces in its effort to acquire  Activision Blizzard ,  getting the deal done might actually turn out to be the easy part.<br />In its first-quarter results Monday morning, Activision said the deal is still on track to close in Microsoft’s next fiscal year, which begins in July. That long window for a transaction announced in January reflects the high level of scrutiny the deal is expected to receive among lawmakers, who have started eyeing big tech’s moves closely. Indeed, last month saw four U.S. senators express concerns about the transaction to the Federal Trade Commission, saying the deal could exacerbate Activision’s now-well-documented internal culture troubles. “We are deeply concerned about consolidation in the tech industry and its impact on workers,” the letter read."
