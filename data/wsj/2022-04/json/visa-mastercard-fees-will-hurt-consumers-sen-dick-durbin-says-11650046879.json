    "body": "Sen. Dick Durbin and other lawmakers are urging Visa Inc. and  Mastercard Inc.  to scrap their planned card fee increases.<br />The two big payments networks are planning this month to raise the fees that many large merchants pay when they accept consumersâ€™ credit cards, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. In a letter sent to the networks Friday, lawmakers said the fee increases would ultimately trickle down to shoppers who are already struggling with runaway inflation."
