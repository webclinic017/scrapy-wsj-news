    "body": "Carvana Co.  joined the cast of postpandemic losers that includes  Netflix Inc.  and  Peloton Interactive Inc.  as investors tossed away the company’s ambitious growth targets and dumped its stock.<br />Shares of the online used-car retailer are down 20% in the past two days and nearly 80% since their peak last summer. Carvana’s earnings on Wednesday laid bare its failure to upend the used-car market despite borrowing billions of dollars to juice growth."
