    "body": "Regarding your editorial “A Big Defeat for Big Labor” (April 1): The power of unions can be seen as a good thing, as a balance against the power of corporations. Yet unions are not government entities, so union dues should not be withheld from paychecks. Members should gladly write a monthly check (credit card, debit card) for union benefits. Political payments shouldn’t be made directly from union money, either. Union bosses should have to convince members to cough up political contributions from their own accounts. Put power in the hands of members, not bosses.<br />When the mayor of Stamford, Conn., Dan Malloy, was running for governor, I asked a Stamford cop what he thought of him. He replied: I hate him, but my union said to vote for him because he’ll give us anything we want."
