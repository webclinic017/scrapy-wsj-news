    "body": "Remember how Democrats sold their student loan takeover as a money-saver? Now millions of borrowers can’t or don’t want to repay their loans, so President Biden says he may cancel their debt. The taxpayers who repaid their loans or didn’t go to college will pay instead.<br />The Administration has repeatedly extended what was supposed to be a temporary pause on student loan payments and interest accrual. This reprieve has cost the government $100 billion and counting—money that Congress hasn’t appropriated. Now Democrats want Mr. Biden to compound the damage to taxpayers and the Constitution by writing off loans by presidential fiat."
