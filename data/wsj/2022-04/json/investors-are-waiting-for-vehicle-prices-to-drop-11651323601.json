    "body": "Sky-high vehicle prices are keeping auto maker profits in the fast lane for now. How long these unusual times will last is largely a macroeconomic call in the short term, and investors expect the worst. Looking further down the road, collaboration between manufacturers and dealers could make a big difference.<br />Many first-quarter results from car manufacturers this past week had one theme in common: pricing power. Numbers from  General Motors ,   Mercedes-Benz ,   Ford  and  Volvo Cars  all beat forecasts as high vehicle prices proved unexpectedly resilient in offsetting the impact of fast-rising costs. Moreover, the companies all said they werenâ€™t yet seeing signs of consumer weakness and maintained full-year guidance despite hurricane-strength headwinds from commodity prices."
