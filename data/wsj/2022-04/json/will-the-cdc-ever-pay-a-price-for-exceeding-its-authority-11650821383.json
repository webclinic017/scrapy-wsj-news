    "body": "Your editorial “The Mask Mandate Goes Down” (April 19) says “this has been a rough few months” for the CDC. How so? Its eviction moratorium was in place for over a year before it was struck down, and the mask mandate even longer. Was the agency penalized in any way for exceeding its statutory authority? Was anybody fired, demoted or anything? The CDC has demonstrated that it can exceed its authority with impunity.<br />Michael J. Galassi"
