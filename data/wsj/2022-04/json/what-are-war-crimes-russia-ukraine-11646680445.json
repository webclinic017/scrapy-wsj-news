    "body": "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought allegations of war crimes against President Vladimir Putin and his army, including accusations from the U.S., raising the question of whether he or his commanders will ultimately be charged. It is a complex legal issue, compounded in part by the fact that Russia, like the U.S. and China, isn’t a party to the International Criminal Court, which usually hears war-crime cases at its headquarters in the Netherlands.<br />ICC prosecutor Karim Khan four days in to the invasion said he would begin an investigation into violations, based on Ukraine’s previously agreeing to the court’s jurisdiction. Mr. Khan traveled to western Ukraine and Poland and held a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He said he was also seeking to meet with Russian officials."
