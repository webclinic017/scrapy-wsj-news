    "body": "Barack Obama’s credibility never recovered after he failed to enforce an announced red line in Syria. It’s no exaggeration to say that whether a national leader keeps his word on such issues can change history. That’s why Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s recent remarks about Chinese power in the Pacific are worth noting.<br />“I share the same red line that the United States has when it comes to these issues,” Mr. Morrison said Sunday of China’s growing influence in the Solomon Islands. “We won’t be having Chinese military naval bases in our region, on our doorstep.” He declined to elaborate on how Canberra would respond if his red line is crossed."
