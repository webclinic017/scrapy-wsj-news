    "body": "Apple Inc.  is set to get some extra mileage out of its big Oscar win. Making it count for the company’s streaming service is the real trick.<br />The company scored a legitimate victory Sunday night when “CODA” took the best-picture prize at the Academy Awards. It was the first time a movie distributed primarily by a streaming service took the honor. Apple didn’t make the film in the sense of greenlighting the script and financing the production. Instead, the company picked up “CODA” following a strong showing at last year’s Sundance Film Festival for $25 million—a record sum for acquisitions from the event. That is also the amount of free cash flow Apple produces about every two hours."
