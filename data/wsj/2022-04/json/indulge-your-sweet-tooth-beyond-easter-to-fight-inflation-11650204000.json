    "body": "Easter celebrations are the perfect excuse to feast on chocolate. Longer term, shoppers with a sweet tooth might find the habit more affordable than what savory snackers encounter.<br />Cocoa, the main raw material for chocolate, is one of the few food commodities slightly cheaper today than before Russiaâ€™s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. A metric ton of cocoa currently costs $2,483.27, down from $2,489.84 on the day the conflict began, data from the agricultural analytics firm AgFlow shows. By comparison, the threat of grain shortfalls as a result of the fighting has sent prices of staple crops such as corn soaring."
