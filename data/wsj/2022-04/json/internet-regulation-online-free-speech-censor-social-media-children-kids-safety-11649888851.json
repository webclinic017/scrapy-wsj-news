    "body": "Peggy Noonan’s proposal to ban everyone under 18 from all social-media sites (“Can Anyone Tame Big Tech?” Declarations, April 9) would turn every kid into an instant criminal for seeking access to information and culture on the dominant medium of their generation. I wonder how she would have felt about adults proposing to ban all kids from listening to TV or radio during her youth.<br />Let’s work to empower parents to help them guide their children’s digital experiences. Better online-safety and media-literacy efforts can prepare kids for a hyperconnected future. We can find workable solutions that wouldn’t usher in unprecedented government control of speech."
