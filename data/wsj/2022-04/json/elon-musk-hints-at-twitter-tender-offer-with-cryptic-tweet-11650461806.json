    "body": "Elon Musk raised the prospect of launching a tender offer to acquire  Twitter Inc.  in a cryptic tweet following his $43 billion offer last week to acquire the social-media platform.<br />Mr. Musk,  Tesla Inc.’s  chief executive, tweeted a blank space followed by the words “is the Night,” late Tuesday Eastern time. Speculation grew that the message was a veiled reference to the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel “Tender Is the Night” and implied the world’s richest man planned to approach Twitter shareholders directly to buy their stock at a specific price over a defined period."
