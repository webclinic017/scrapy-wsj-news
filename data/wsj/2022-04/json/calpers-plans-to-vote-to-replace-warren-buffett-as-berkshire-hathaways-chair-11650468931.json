    "body": "The nation’s largest pension fund is planning to vote for a proposal that would unseat Warren Buffett as chairman of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc.<br />The $470 billion California Public Employees’ Retirement System, known as Calpers, said in a regulatory filing that it would support a proposal by the National Legal and Policy Center that Berkshire Hathaway’s board chair be independent. That would disqualify Mr. Buffett, who is also the company’s chief executive, from holding both positions."
