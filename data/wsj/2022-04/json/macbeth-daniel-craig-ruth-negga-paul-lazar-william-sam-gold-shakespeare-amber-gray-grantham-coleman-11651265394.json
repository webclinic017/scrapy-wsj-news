    "body": "New York<br />Hie thee to the Longacre Theatre, should you be interested in seeing one of the more dismal Shakespeare productions ever to grace—or rather besmirch—a Broadway stage in recent memory. The highly anticipated production of “Macbeth,” starring Daniel Craig and Ruth Negga, closes the pandemic-plagued Broadway season on a dispiritingly dreary note. Misguided in execution and largely indifferently acted, this minimalist production does no favors to either of its talented stars."
