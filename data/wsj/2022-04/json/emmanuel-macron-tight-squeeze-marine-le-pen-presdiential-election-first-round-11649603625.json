    "body": "Emmanuel Macron expected to have an easy path to re-election as French President, and he campaigned like it. But voters have a way of disrupting complacency, and they sent him a clear warning in Sunday’s first election round.<br />Mr. Macron finished first but too close for comfort in the crowded field, with some 29% of the vote. In two weeks he’ll face Marine Le Pen, the right-wing tribune with about 24%, beating Jean-Luc Mélenchon (a French Bernie Sanders) for second and a spot in the April 24 runoff. Mr. Macron’s supporters note he improved on his 24% first-round result in 2017, but then he was the outsider."
