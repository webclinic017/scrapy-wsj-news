    "body": "Imran Khan seems to think America-bashing can return him to power in Pakistan. The former prime minister, who lost his job in a no-confidence vote Sunday, told thousands of supporters at a rally in Peshawar Wednesday night to take to the streets in opposition to “these slaves of America,” his term for the new government led by Prime Minister Shebaz Sharif.<br />This may play well domestically, and among a section of the Pakistani diaspora, but ultimately it’s a recipe for failure. If Mr. Khan were more responsible, he would resist the temptation to upend his country’s foreign relations in pursuit of political gain. He would also recognize that Pakistan’s problems are ultimately of its own making."
