    "body": "In “MIT Leads the Way in Reinstating the SAT” (Upward Mobility, April 6), Jason Riley writes that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology likely feels it must compete for top students with institutions such as the California Institute of Technology. But Mr. Riley doesn’t explain why technical schools need to retain testing, while liberal arts schools are tending to abolish the practice.<br />The answer is simple: When an English major turns out to be substandard, no serious consequences ensue. With a rocket engineer, an air disaster, followed by death and destruction, ensues."
