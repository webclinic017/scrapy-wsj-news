    "body": "In Peter Bogdanovich’s “Nickelodeon” (1976), a comedy-drama about the early years of moviemaking, a novice actor played by Burt Reynolds finds himself in a bakery that fronts for an independent movie company—one that is running afoul of Thomas Edison’s film-camera patents. The scene ends with a patent enforcer gunning down a camera—“That man killed a box,” says Reynolds’s character—and a fight amid flour and baked goods. It’s all played for laughs, but it’s based on a kernel of truth: Moviemakers crossed Edison at their peril.<br />Audiences familiar with “Nickelodeon” might have a shock of recognition when reading Paul Fischer’s lively “The Man Who Invented Motion Pictures: A True Tale of Obsession, Murder, and the Movies,” in which Edison—and his patents—play a prominent role. As Mr. Fischer shows, any major technological advancement is likely to involve people who hog or deny credit, and the innovations behind filmmaking were no exception."
