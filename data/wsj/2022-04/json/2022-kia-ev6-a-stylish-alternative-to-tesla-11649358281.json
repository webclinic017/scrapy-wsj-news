    "body": "IN ART CRITIC Robert Hughes’s excellent book “Rome: A Cultural, Visual, and Personal History,” (2011) he recalls a time like ours, when a consumer society heard progress knocking but was unsure whether to open because, through the door, progress sounded like a weirdo.<br />In 1909, the Italian writer Filippo Tommaso Marinetti published “The Futurist Manifesto,” exalting the uniquely modern miracle of speed, made possible by pistons, dynamos, petrol and spark. As an advocate for advancement in an age of lamplighters, Marinetti could hardly go wrong, but he did anyway, with dark prophecies of humanity’s evolution into a race of soft-tooled symbiotes to serve the machine overlords. He also advocated banning pasta on the grounds that it made Italians soft and lazy, which was an even less popular initiative."
