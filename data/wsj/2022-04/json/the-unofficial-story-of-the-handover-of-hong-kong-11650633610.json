    "body": "Twenty-five years ago, Hong Kong returned to Chinese sovereignty amid scenes of high pageantry as Beijing pledged to leave the city’s way of life unchanged for 50 years. Today that promise is in tatters.<br />In June 2020, Beijing imposed a National Security Law that has led to the arrest of more than 183 people, including 47 politicians and activists whose crime was to hold U.S.-style primaries ahead of elections to select their most popular candidates. Only “patriots” can now run for elected office, and the city’s once-dynamic civil society is on death watch, with political parties, civic groups and trade unions forced to close down."
