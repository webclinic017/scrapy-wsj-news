    "body": "In “The Right’s Russia Temptation” (op-ed, April 11), Jeffrey Scott Shapiro alleges that “leading America-firsters are parroting the Kremlin’s narrative” on the war in Ukraine and are mistaking Vladimir Putin for a strong nationalist leader like former President Donald Trump.<br />While some in Washington casually call themselves “America First,” we at the America First Policy Institute, who served in senior positions in the Trump administration, have been abundantly clear in condemning Mr. Putin’s destructive invasion of Ukraine and the atrocities his military is committing there. Assertions that this movement has taken a “dangerous turn” or is pro-Putin are nonsense."
