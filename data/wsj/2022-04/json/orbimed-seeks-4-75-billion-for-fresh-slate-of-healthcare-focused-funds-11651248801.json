    "body": "Healthcare-focused investment firm OrbiMed Advisors is seeking $4.75 billion across three new funds a little more than a year after raising $3.5 billion for a trio of predecessor vehicles, regulatory filings indicate.<br />The New York-based firm is pitching its latest funds following a record year of private investment in the healthcare sector. Private-equity firms signed a total of some $151 billion worth of healthcare deals globally in 2021, driven by a glut of large transactions, WSJ Pro Private Equity previously reported. Venture investment in the sector also hit a record, surpassing $86 billion in 2021, according to a report by Silicon Valley Bank that cites data from PitchBook Data Inc."
