    "body": "Japan’s central bank has won its first round against bond speculators. The result—a weaker yen—means the battle isn’t over yet.<br />The Bank of Japan stood firm on its low-rates commitment this week as the market pushed bond yields upward in a bet the central bank would follow its counterparts into monetary tightening. On Monday, the yield on Japan’s 10-year bond yield briefly broke above 0.25%—the  BOJ ’s  cap under its yield-curve-control policy—from 0.17% at the beginning of March. But that selloff lost steam after the central bank reiterated its resolve to defend its benchmark, including by buying unlimited government bonds. The 10-year yield stood at 0.21% on Friday."
