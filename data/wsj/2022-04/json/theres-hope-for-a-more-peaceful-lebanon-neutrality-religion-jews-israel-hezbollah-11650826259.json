    "body": "Beirut<br />Billions of dollars in Iranian support and a menacing military-media machine have allowed Hezbollah, a creature of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, to dominate Lebanese politics and wage war as if it were a state. This has brought the country to economic disaster, but it has emboldened a new wave of activists determined to upend this status quo. Their demand: Restore Lebanon’s historical posture of neutrality toward regional conflicts, which spawned generations of balanced foreign policy and open society and earned it the moniker “Switzerland of the Middle East.” Among the new movement’s champions is Bechara Boutros Al Rai, patriarch of Lebanon’s ancient Maronite Christian sect."
