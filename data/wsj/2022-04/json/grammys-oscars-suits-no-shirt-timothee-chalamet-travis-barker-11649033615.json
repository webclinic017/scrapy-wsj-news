    "body": "What exactly do all these celebrities have against the dress shirt? In the course of a week, the inoffensive button-up—a staple in men’s fashion since time immemorial—has mysteriously become as passé as Betamax in Hollywood.<br />At tonight’s Grammy awards, best progressive R&B album nominee Eric Bellinger skipped a shirt beneath his taffy green suit. Travis Barker similarly went sans shirt beneath his sleeveless black blazer—the better to brandish his generous tattoos. During a performance late in the show, Leslie Odom Jr. didn’t let a dress shirt get in the way of his yolk yellow suit."
