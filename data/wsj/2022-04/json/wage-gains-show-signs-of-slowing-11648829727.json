    "body": "Wages continued to grow in March, but the pace has cooled slightly over the past few months, suggesting employers are feeling less pressure to offer pay increases as more people return to the workforce, which could ease inflation pressures.<br />Average hourly earnings were up a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in March over the previous month, following Februaryâ€™s relatively weak 0.1% rise, the Labor Department said Friday. In the previous six months, by contrast, monthly wage gains averaged 0.5%."
