    "body": "When Sally Schmitt founded the French Laundry restaurant in Yountville, Calif., with her husband, Don, in 1978, the Napa Valley was not yet a destination for foodies. Celebrity chefs were a rarity, and female chefs even scarcer. Schmitt was a proponent of the farm-to-table movement and California cuisine long before either were called that.<br />“Six California Kitchens,” Schmitt’s memoir and cookbook, was 10 years in the making. Sadly, she did not live to see the fruits of this particular labor: Schmitt died on March 5, just five days after her 90th birthday and a month before the book’s publication. But her forthright, unpretentious presence is very much alive in this beautiful volume filled with food, family, reminiscences, recipes and no-nonsense cooking tips."
