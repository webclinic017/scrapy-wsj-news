    "body": "WASHINGTON—The U.S. took its first actions Thursday to enforce sweeping restrictions on the export of technology and industrial goods to Russia, a warning to Russian companies and any foreign countries who seek to help them circumvent the measures aimed at undermining Russia’s defense and technology industries.<br />Commerce Department officials said they were issuing orders to deny three Russian airlines— Aeroflot ,  Azur Air, and UTair—the ability to access U.S.-made parts or receive services from anyone anywhere in the world. They said they were taking the actions after the airlines violated export controls by flying U.S.-made aircraft or foreign-made aircraft containing U.S. parts. None of the airlines could be immediately reached for comment."
