    "body": "Joseph Sternberg misses the point of why American conservatives like me think Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has something to teach our right-of-center politicians (“Hungary Is No Model for Conservatives,” Political Economics, April 8). Mr. Sternberg writes as if Mr. Orbán’s fights with the European Union over funding are relevant to the case we make. He’s wrong. We can leave aside the question of whether the EU bureaucracy should be telling member states how to educate their children about sex, because it says nothing about the argument for an American Orbán.<br />Hungary is a vastly different country than the U.S., so transplanting its system to America is neither possible nor desirable. What’s worth copying from Mr. Orbán is a style of populist, national-conservative leadership based on several realities that typically elude U.S. conservatives."
