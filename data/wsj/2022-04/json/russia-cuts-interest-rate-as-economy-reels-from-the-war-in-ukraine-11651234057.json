    "body": "Russia’s central bank Friday delivered a second cut in its key interest rate this month in an effort to support an economy battered by the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions.<br />The Bank of Russia lowered its key interest rate to 14% from 17%, having already cut borrowing costs from 20% on April 8. Policy makers led by central bank chief Elvira Nabiullina, doubled the key rate in an emergency meeting on Feb. 28 as they scrambled to support the ruble after Western governments froze almost half of the country’s foreign exchange reserves."
