    "body": "On the 2020 campaign trail, Joe Biden declared, “Milton Friedman isn’t running the show anymore.” Wrong! In March 2020 the money supply was $16 trillion, it’s now $21.8 trillion. Lo and behold, inflation is running at 7.9%, supply chains are tight, and many store shelves are empty. Friedman’s adage “Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon” has stood the test of time.<br />But what scares me most is the likely policy responses by the Biden administration that would pour salt into this self-inflicted wound. It feels as if price controls are coming. Don’t trust my Spidey senses? Joe Biden’s own words from March 16: “Oil and gas companies shouldn’t pad their profits at the expense of hardworking Americans.” And in last month’s State of the Union address he said, “As Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up. That ends on my watch.”"
