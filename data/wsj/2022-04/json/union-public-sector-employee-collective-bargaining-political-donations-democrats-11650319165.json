    "body": "In “The High Cost of Not Being Wisconsin” (Cross Country, April 6) Carol Platt Liebau writes, “Connecticut taxpayers have good reason to wonder where racing in the opposite direction [of Wisconsin] will take them.” Connecticut taxpayers have better reason to wonder why they have no representation at the negotiating table when the public unions make their extraordinary demands.<br />In business, executives and board members are required to recuse themselves from decisions in which they have a financial interest that potentially conflicts with shareholder interests. With our state and federal officials, almost universally members of the Democratic Party, we have a vicious circle of union election funding followed by their beneficiaries cutting the unions sweetheart deals across the table."
