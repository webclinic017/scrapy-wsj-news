    "body": "Does Wall Street finally believe the Federal Reserve? Officials have warned for weeks that the central bank would tighten policy faster than many expected to break inflation. So the tumult among bond and stock traders after Chairman Jerome Powell repeated the promise on Thursday is late in coming.<br />Mr. Powell all but confirmed the Fed will raise its policy rate by 50 basis points in May, more than the usual 25-point move. Stocks and bonds promptly tumbled, with the S&P 500 down 1.5% Thursday and another 2.8% Friday, the Nasdaq falling 2.1% and then 2.6%, and the 10-year Treasury yield spiking to 2.917% Thursday."
