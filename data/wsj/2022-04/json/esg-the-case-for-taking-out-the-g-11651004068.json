    "body": "Investors often use ESG criteria to measure a company’s commitment to values beyond shareholder returns—in particular to environmental and social priorities. A perplexing question is why governance—the “G” in ESG—is included as a third factor.<br />Governance is unlike E and S. This isn’t to say a commitment to governance is incompatible with a commitment to certain environmental and social causes. But good governance, while required, is conceptually distinct from the first two things, making it an ineffective measure of how socially responsible a company is."
