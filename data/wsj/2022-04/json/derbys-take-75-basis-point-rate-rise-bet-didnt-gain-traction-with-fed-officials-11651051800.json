    "body": "While the Federal Reserve may be behind the curve in getting inflation under control, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard has generally been out in front among policy makers in calling for aggressive action by the central bank.<br />Mr. Bullard, a central bank veteran who took office in 2008, was among the first Fed officials to speak out about the need for the central bank to shift gears on its efforts to reduce its balance sheet, which had swollen as a form of stimulus, and was at the forefront in calling publicly for interest rate rises to confront some of the worst inflation readings seen in 40 years."
