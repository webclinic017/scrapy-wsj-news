    "body": "Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said Thursday that the U.S. central bank is well behind the curve in its effort to get an “exceptionally high” rate of inflation under control.<br />Mr. Bullard said that by using monetary-policy rules, the federal funds rate, now at between 0.25% and 0.50%, should probably be at 3.5%, while a market-based interpretation also points to the need for substantial rate increases."
