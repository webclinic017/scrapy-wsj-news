    "body": "It’s worth recalling just how fanciful and arbitrary was  Twitter ’s  decision to ban President Donald Trump from the site in 2021 after the Jan. 6 riot.<br />The most newsworthy figure in the world, Mr. Trump was not short of ways to broadcast his claims about the 2020 election. Cable channels carried them live. News organizations dissected them. The things Mr. Trump was saying could be heard everywhere except on Twitter. In the service’s words, he was canned not because he advocated violence (he didn’t), but because of the instransitive fact of “how [his tweets] are being received and interpreted on and off Twitter.”"
