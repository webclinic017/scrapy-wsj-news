    "body": "I served in the Trump administration and fiercely defended the former president. During his administration, no dictator dared do anything close to what Vladimir Putin is doing in Ukraine now. But the things some America-first conservatives are now saying about Mr. Putin alarm me.<br />I noticed this after I condemned Russia’s invasion in a group chat with Trump appointees. One replied with a Z, the pro-Russia war symbol. One made a vulgar suggestion that President Volodymyr Zelensky was crooked. Others supported Ukraine, and it was clear our group was splitting into two factions."
