    "body": "Indonesia’s ride-hailing champion GoTo Group made a bold market debut on Monday—with shares at one point 23% above their initial public offering price—defying turbulent market conditions across the globe.<br />Investors’ initial vote of confidence in the company—and Southeast Asia’s largest economy—might be justified. But with a rich valuation compared with some peers, the company needs to take advantage of its current favorable market and regulatory position to cement its dominance. If the past couple of years have proven anything, it is that regulatory forbearance—and investor tolerance for loss-making firms—can be fickle."
