    "body": "In 2008 the playwright David Mamet famously announced that he had become a conservative and was no longer a “brain-dead liberal.” He explained why in his 2011 book, “The Secret Knowledge: On the Dismantling of American Culture.” Mr. Mamet wrote: “Liberalism is a religion” that asserts that “evil does not exist.” This is “contrary to common sense.”<br />“The Secret Knowledge” was Mr. Mamet’s first collection of political essays (though his 1996 “Make-Believe Town”—a collection of “essays and remembrances” about Hollywood and Broadway—had a few political zingers). His latest volume, “Recessional: The Death of Free Speech and the Cost of a Free Lunch,” picks up where “The Secret Knowledge” left off, but there are a few differences between the two."
