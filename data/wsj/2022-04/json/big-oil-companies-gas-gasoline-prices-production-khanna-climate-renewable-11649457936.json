    "body": "Your editorial “Gasoline Price Amnesia” (April 6) omits my advocacy for bipartisan policies to increase short-term oil production. I strongly support the president’s decision to release 180 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I have also called for the government to buy oil to refill our reserves, guaranteeing a floor price that economists agree will boost production.<br />Americans are getting fleeced with a 29% year-to-date increase in oil prices and a 20% increase in gas prices in the past month. Big Oil is making record profits as a result of Vladimir Putin’s war and putting billions into stock buybacks. My windfall-profit tax, proposed with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, will go after corporate profiteering and give an inflation rebate to Americans to help with gas bills."
