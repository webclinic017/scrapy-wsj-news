    "body": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell promised last month that a “soft landing,” one with neither a recession nor high unemployment, is in the works. He cited three historic tightening cycles, 1965, 1984 and 1994, when soft landings occurred.<br />With the glaring exception of inflation, the U.S. economy is performing well. The labor market is tight, incomes are growing, and household balance sheets are strong. Corporate inventories are low while margins are near record levels. But inflation is at a 40-year high, almost four times the Fed’s target of 2%. The Fed has dropped its “transitory inflation” rhetoric and has turned hawkish. As the Fed addresses inflation, what conditions must prevail to ensure a soft landing?"
