    "body": "When borrowers miss a payment or two, it’s their problem. If they start missing lots of them, it becomes investors’ problem too. The big question is which investors might be left holding the bag.<br />Over the course of the pandemic, something remarkable happened in consumer credit: It got way less risky to lend. At the outset of the crisis, U.S. lenders started setting aside huge reserves anticipating that a surge in unemployment and economic stress could lead many debts to go unpaid. But after stimulus payments and tax credits from the government, private forbearance and restructuring programs, and a drop in nonessential spending, the wave of defaults didn’t come."
