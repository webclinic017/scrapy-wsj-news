    "body": "A letter writer claims that “Crimea is viscerally connected with the Russian soul” and that “its return could salve that soul and send the giant home” (March 22). I am skeptical of such metaphysical pronouncements, and Vladimir Putin wants far more than Crimea, but the example is worth taking up.<br />Crimea was predominantly Muslim in the 18th century and loosely affiliated with the Ottomans. It remained Muslim well into the l9th century. During World War II, Stalin felt that the Crimean Tatars, who had lived there for centuries, might be disloyal, so he deported them to Siberia. After World War II, as Khrushchev told his son, the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine made sense administratively. The only reason Mr. Putin wants to undo it is to promote his messianic expansion into Ukrainian territory."
