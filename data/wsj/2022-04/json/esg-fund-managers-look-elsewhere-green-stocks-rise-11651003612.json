    "body": "For ESG investors who want strong returns, the greenest stocks may be getting too expensive.<br />A tidal wave of money has flowed into funds focused on environmental, social and corporate-governance principles in recent years. Assets in such funds hit $2.74 trillion at the end of last year, according to Morningstar. But an appetite for green stocks with the best credentials means those shares now come with a premium. So some fund managers are looking instead to invest in companies that are still working to improve their ESG footprint."
