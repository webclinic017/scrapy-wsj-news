    "body": "Parents ask me all the time how to protect their children from possible danger on social media and lock down their devices. Unfortunately, there is no one way to just do that.<br />You can use platform-level controls—Apple Family Sharing for iPhones, Google Family Link for Android and Chromebooks—to set limits on which apps your kids can download and how much time they can spend on them. But those tools don’t allow you to manage what kids see on those apps or prevent them from communicating with strangers. If that help is available at all, it is found in the apps themselves."
