    "body": "Boston<br />Two years after the fear of a racial contretemps temporarily scuttled “Philip Guston Now,” the retrospective exhibition of the painter has just opened at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. In attempted reassurance, viewers are told that “We have thought deeply about what it means to present Guston’s paintings while respecting both the context in which they were made and their meaning for audiences today.” (The exhibition will proceed, in semi-independent versions, to Washington, Houston and London.) Which means that the show is both the same and different. It’s still an ample retrospective of 73 paintings and 27 drawings displaying Guston’s stylistic shifts, including—actually featuring—the sardonic KKK paintings that delayed the original show. But the exhibition has now been recontextualized both to show that Guston was not an inadvertent racist and to provide a didactic cushion for those who might be offended or seriously discomfited by Guston’s late-career imagery of Ku Klux Klansmen. (The museum has hired a trauma specialist for visitors disturbed by the work; an alternative exit provides an escape hatch.)"
