    "body": "China’s stock market staged a sudden recovery last month as investors became hopeful of stimulus from Beijing. Fears of prolonged Covid-19 restrictions have prompted an equally sudden reassessment.<br />Chinese shares have plummeted this week amid worries that Beijing is headed for a lockdown, following in the footsteps of Shanghai, where social distancing has been enforced for weeks despite mounting economic costs. That has dashed hopes that the government may take a less stringent approach in dealing with the more contagious Omicron variant."
