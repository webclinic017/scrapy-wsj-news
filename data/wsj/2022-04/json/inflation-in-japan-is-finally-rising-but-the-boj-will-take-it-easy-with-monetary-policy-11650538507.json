    "body": "TOKYO—In Japan, where prices have been roughly flat for decades, inflation is finally taking off. But unlike the Federal Reserve in the U.S., the Bank of Japan has resolved to keep interest rates low, helping drive a fall in the yen.<br />On Thursday, the Japanese central bank resumed another bond-buying move aimed at keeping a lid on rates. It promised to purchase unlimited quantities of government bonds to cap the yield at 0.25%—less than one-tenth the return on the equivalent U.S. Treasury bonds. The notice of intent, which lasts until Tuesday, was enough to push the yield below the cap without any actual purchases Thursday."
