    "body": "“CODA,” which won the Academy Award for Best Picture last week, is a triumph for many reasons. One is that Hollywood recognized the devastating effect of excessive government regulation on American families.<br />“CODA” is a drama about the deaf community, the perseverance of a loving family, and the impact of a teacher. It also portrays how an overzealous regulatory state can destroy one of America’s oldest industries, New England fisheries."
