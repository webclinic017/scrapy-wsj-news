    "body": "French President Emmanuel Macron won a second five-year term on Sunday over Marine Le Pen, and the Western alliance against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine can breathe easier. The question is whether Mr. Macron will do more in the next five years to make France great again.<br />The President is the first French leader to earn a second term in two decades, and he owes his victory in part to the luck of having Ms. Le Pen as an opponent. A political newcomer in 2017, he beat Ms. Le Pen by 32 percentage points while warning of his opponent’s radicalism and vowing to restore French dynamism. Projections Sunday showed a smaller if still decisive 58-42 victory."
