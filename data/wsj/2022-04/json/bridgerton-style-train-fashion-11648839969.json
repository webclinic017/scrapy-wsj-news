    "body": "“WHOA, LADY, nice dress!” said some awe-struck guy on the platform of the West 4th Street subway in New York last week. This was not a vulgar catcall—I was swathed in more fabric than the Virgin Mary. And it was a nice dress: a violet Marc Jacobs gown with a staggering fabric train in the back and front. It was one of five such garments I tested to see if this season’s most confounding trend—the “everyday” train—is indeed a viable option for every day.<br />The spring collections are teeming with trains from brands such as Louis Vuitton and Rick Owens. Among them are plenty of high-octane options ideal for Hollywood events like last Sunday’s Oscars, where bolts of fabric trailed behind stars like Cynthia Erivo and Zendaya. Some designers, however, are positing trains as casual fare, paired not with diamonds and stilettos but T-shirts and slides."
