    "body": "Lawyers representing Sandy Hook families are accusing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones of placing his Infowars website into bankruptcy as a last-ditch effort to avoid an upcoming trial to establish damages for falsely claiming the 2012 shooting was a hoax.<br />“This was their only avenue to stop this trial from happening,” Cordt Akers, a lawyer representing some of the families, told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday after a state judge in Austin, Texas, postponed the trial that was set to begin next week."
