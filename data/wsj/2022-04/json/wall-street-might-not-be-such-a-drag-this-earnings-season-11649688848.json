    "body": "Like quarreling families, every volatile market is volatile in its own way.<br />Looking at a quarter’s price and volume action, it can be hard to always forecast opportunities for profit available to Wall Street banks. Wall Street often talks about “good volatility” and “bad volatility,” with the former being an opportunity to help clients do big new trades or deals, and the latter meaning clients retreat and revenue dries up. The latest quarter likely had some of both, but there are reasons to expect some positive surprises."
