    "body": "William Galston’s “How Will Inflation End?” (Politics & Ideas, April 6) discusses the debate among Keynesian economists about the recent mistiming of fiscal and monetary policy. Keynesians believe that generalists in Congress can time fiscal policy and bureaucrats at the Federal Reserve can time price controls in credit markets, both to dampen the business cycle.<br />Ever tried to time a future wedding on a rainless day? No, because it is too difficult to forecast the weather. The same is true for timing government interventions into the economy. But Keynesians keep trusting the timing of officials with poor incentives to forecast the economy correctly, even though the private sector—with the right incentives—is terrible at it."
