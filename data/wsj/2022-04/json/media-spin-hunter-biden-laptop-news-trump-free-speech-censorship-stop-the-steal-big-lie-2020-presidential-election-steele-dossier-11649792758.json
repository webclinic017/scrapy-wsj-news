    "body": "In his “free speech” campaign against  Twitter ,  Elon Musk didn’t mention it but millions of Americans were thinking of it: the national media’s belated interest in the Hunter Biden laptop story that Twitter and other conventional and social media outlets previously suppressed.<br />As if waking from a coma, the Washington Post last week finally asked, “Why is confirmation of a story that first surfaced in the fall of 2020 emerging only now?” Alas, the paper entitles its editorial “an opportunity for a reckoning,” because, you know, opportunities can be turned down. And the Post does. Instead it justifies the suppression by saying that, because the press was the “unwitting tools of a Russian influence campaign in 2016,” it was “only prudent to suspect a similar plot lay behind the mysterious appearance of a computer stuffed with juicy documents and conveniently handed over to President Donald Trump’s toxic personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani.”"
