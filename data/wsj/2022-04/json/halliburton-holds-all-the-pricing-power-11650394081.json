    "body": "With oil prices at eight-year highs and equipment shortages keeping negotiating power on the oil-field-service companiesâ€™ side,  Halliburton  is having a field day.<br />The oil-field-services giant had a healthy first quarter, with total revenue increasing 24% compared with a year earlier, above analyst expectations polled by FactSet. Much of that was driven by strong growth in North America. Revenue grew 37% in that region while its international segment saw 15% growth."
