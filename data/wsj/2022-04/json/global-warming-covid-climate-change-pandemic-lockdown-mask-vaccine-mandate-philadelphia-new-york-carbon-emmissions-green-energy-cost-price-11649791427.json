    "body": "Covid and global warming, two of the century’s biggest issues so far, have an unappreciated similarity: Both have triggered extreme overreactions by policy makers. The most harshly restrictive Covid policies have recently collapsed. With any luck, we’ll soon be able to say the same about over-the-top climate policies.<br />Governments often go overboard when responding to new threats, and policy makers’ response to Covid mirrored their continuing overreaction to global warming. In both cases they have failed to pursue mitigation strategies that minimize total harm to society. The initial policy response to Covid caused social and economic harms that, in the aggregate, proved worse than the disease itself. Likewise, discussions about the total harm from rising global temperatures often ignore the costs associated with preventing warming."
