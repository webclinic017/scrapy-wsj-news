    "body": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz promised Germans and their allies a transformation in Berlin’s approach to foreign and defense policy. As voters and North Atlantic Treaty partners try to assess whether he meant it, a question looms: Where are Germany’s arms for Ukraine?<br />The snail-like pace of weapons shipments to Kyiv’s military is becoming a political scandal in Germany. Berlin has improved on its laughable offer of 5,000 helmets, extended in mid-February before Vladimir Putin started his invasion. Germany has since shipped an assortment of anti-aircraft missiles, rocket-propelled grenades, machine guns, mines and the like."
