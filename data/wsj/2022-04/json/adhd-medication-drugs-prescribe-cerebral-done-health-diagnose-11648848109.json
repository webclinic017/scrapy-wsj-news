    "body": "Regarding “The Anxiety Inside the Online ADHD Treatment Business” (Exchange, March 26): We at Cerebral Inc. focus on patient safety and clinical quality while treating a range of conditions with behavioral-based treatments and medications. Access to mental-health care is a persistent barrier. Our model is new. But it is working—60% of our new patients have never had access to a mental-health professional. We offer therapy, coaching, meditation and medication, if clinically appropriate. We adhere to national clinical standards, and our work is governed by a clinical advisory board of mental-health experts.<br />Our ADHD service line is a small part of our business. We take the practice of prescribing controlled substances to treat it very seriously. We have in place protocols to ensure that they are prescribed safely and only when necessary. Only a single-digit percentage of our patients have been prescribed Adderall."
