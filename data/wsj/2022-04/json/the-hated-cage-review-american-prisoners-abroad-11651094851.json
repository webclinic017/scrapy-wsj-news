    "body": "Shrouded in mist and legend, the desolate uplands of Dartmoor in southwest England are perhaps best known as the setting for Arthur Conan Doyle’s classic story “The Hound of the Baskervilles.” Yet Conan Doyle was far prouder of his historical fiction, which included the exploits of the dashing Napoleonic hussar Brig. Etienne Gerard. In one adventure, Gerard is penned within Dartmoor prison, an institution opened in 1809 to confine soldiers and sailors captured by Britain in a war with France that had already lasted 16 years.<br />It was not only Frenchmen who were incarcerated inside the grim, granite-built jail. From the spring of 1813, the inmates were joined by Americans taken prisoner during the War of 1812. In two years, more than 6,500 American prisoners of war passed through Dartmoor’s main gateway, filing beneath a stone arch inscribed with the motto parcere subjectis—spare the vanquished."
