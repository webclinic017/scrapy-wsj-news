    "body": "‘Reality is things as they are,” Wallace Stevens declared, and who could argue with that? Well, legions of philosophers and any number of novelists, among them Emily St. John Mandel, who, like an ingenious origami artist, seems determined with each new work to add yet another fold to our perception of what is real and one further twist to what we think of as time. The result can be dizzying and often bleak. A character’s life may suddenly veer off course. The components of everyday existence may simply vanish. In Ms. Mandel’s “The Glass Hotel,” for example, money disappears; in “The Lola Quartet” and “The Singer’s Gun,” identities mutate; and in “Station Eleven,” civilization itself is undone and refashioned.<br />So what next? Could our entire planet be due for reconfiguration? Certainly. For as one character in Ms. Mandel’s novel “Sea of Tranquility” points out: “No star burns forever . . . the world will eventually literally end.” The word “eventually” is, of course, consoling. But there is little else of comfort in this restless, time-warping narrative that takes us farther from home—intellectually and geographically—than any of Ms. Mandel’s previous creations ever has. To a desolate place that is nonetheless intended to be humanity’s final refuge."
