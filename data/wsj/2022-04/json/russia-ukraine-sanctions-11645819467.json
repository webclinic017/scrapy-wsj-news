    "body": "The U.S. and its European allies are imposing a widening array of economic penalties on Russia in punishment for its invasion of Ukraine, and pressure for tougher action is rising after Ukraine alleged that Russian forces committed potential war crimes against civilians. Punitive measures rolled out so far target Russia’s financial sector, major companies, President Vladimir Putin, his daughters, other government officials, members of Russia’s elite and the Nord Stream 2 natural-gas pipeline. The U.S. and European governments say more are forthcoming.<br />Economic sanctions, export controls and other measures became the main tools of retaliation for the West after President Biden said that the U.S. wouldn’t send troops to defend Ukraine, which isn’t a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."
