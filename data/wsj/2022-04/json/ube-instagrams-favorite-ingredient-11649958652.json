    "body": "THE ONLY RULE when making ube halaya in my Filipino family: If you’re snagging a bite, you’d better stir. The bubbling, electric-purple jam must be mixed steadily for nearly an hour on the stovetop. Once it cooks down to a viscous consistency, the jam delivers the concentrated flavor of the purple yam ube, sweet and nutty with a fragrant vanilla note—a taste growing increasingly familiar stateside.<br />“I think there’s a sense of wonder around the flavor,” said Brooklyn chef Angela Dimayuga. Her recent cookbook (right), “Filipinx: Heritage Recipes From The Diaspora” (Abrams), includes dishes that derive their round, mellow taste and vivid color from ube."
