    "body": "London<br />The circle at Stonehenge, in England, was raised around the same time, 2,500 B.C., as the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. Its alignment suggests that it was almost certainly a solar shrine. But Stonehenge has no hieroglyphics, only a Druidic folk mythology out of Julius Caesar’s memoirs and Asterix cartoons. “The World of Stonehenge,” an ingenious and innovative exhibition at the British Museum, is as close as we can get to its making and makers."
