    "body": "The department store—or grand magasin—was born 150 years ago in Paris with Bon Marché, a store that spanned an entire city block on the Left Bank of the Seine. Its uniformed garçons flung open its doors in 1872, and in doing so, flung open a world that not only turned provincials into Parisians but also helped turn Paris into what Walter Benjamin called the “capital of the 19th century.”<br />It was perhaps the worst of times for the store’s creator, Aristide Boucicaut, to launch so daring an experiment. Paris was still reeling from both the humiliating defeat to Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and the bloody civil war, known as the Paris Commune, that had immediately followed. But those events also made it the best of times for such an adventure. What better distraction for a city whose bourgeois residents were desperate to leave behind the recent terror? Now they would make their pilgrimage to what the store’s famous chronicler, the novelist Émile Zola, pronounced a “cathedral of commerce.”"
