    "body": "The scenes of murder and mass graves from Bucha and other towns and cities in Ukraine are shocking the world, and we hope they linger in memory for longer than a TikTok video. The war crimes on prima facie display should underscore the West’s resolve that they can’t go unpunished.<br />President Biden added his outrage on Monday by repeating his charge that Vladimir Putin is “a war criminal” who should be put on trial. He called for an investigation, which is already underway at the U.S. State Department and the International Criminal Court in the Hague. But now that Mr. Biden and other leaders are calling out the crimes, they have to do something or the world will see that such brutality leads to momentary outrage but nothing more."
