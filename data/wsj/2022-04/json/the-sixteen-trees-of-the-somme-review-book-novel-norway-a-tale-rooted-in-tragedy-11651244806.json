    "body": "In 2015 Lars Mytting became a global bestselling author with “Norwegian Wood,” a kind of lumberjack’s self-help guide, with shades of Thoreau’s  “Walden.” Having first appeared in Norway in 2011, this book must take at least some blame for the craze for hygge—the Danish concept of coziness, nostalgia and craftsmanship co-opted by marketers as an all-purpose Scandinavian lifestyle brand to sell overpriced candles and itchy woolen socks.<br />When he wrote “Norwegian Wood,” Mr. Mytting had already published two novels. He immediately returned to fiction, but did not entirely abandon his winning formula. The result, published in Oslo in 2014, now appears in the U.S. as “The Sixteen Trees of the Somme.” The novel is steeped in hygge and obsessed with woodwork—and hinges its entire narrative on the story of some logs."
