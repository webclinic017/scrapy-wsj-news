    "body": "In the 2021 movie “Old,” a group of vacationers is stranded on a secluded beach where the aging process is accelerated. Decades, they soon realize, pass in a matter of hours. Alas, the premise is better than the film, but it suffices as a metaphor for Black Lives Matter, a movement that has quickly aged into a racket.<br />BLM got its start in 2013 following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. It gained traction a year later, when Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Mo. According to a national poll published by the Daily Kos, support for BLM peaked at 52% in June 2020, a month after George Floyd was murdered by a police officer in Minneapolis. Its popularity has declined since then, and recent revelations about the organization’s spending habits are unlikely to reverse that trend."
