    "body": "Buried on page 82 of the Biden administration budget’s proposed tax changes for 2023 is a section that would give the Internal Revenue Service more time to audit individuals and large companies. Current law limits the IRS to three years to assess a tax deficiency, except if a taxpayer appears to have failed to report at least 25% of income, in which case the agency gets six years. There’s no time limit if the suspected omissions are deliberate. The Biden proposal would change this standard by also allowing six years if the IRS believes the taxpayer has unintentionally omitted more than $100 million from a return.<br />On the surface, this may appear a reasonable measure. It’s appropriate for the IRS to audit corporations that fail to report income, and $100 million sure seems like a lot of money. But it’s complicated."
