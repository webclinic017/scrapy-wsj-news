    "body": "Walk into a big-city pharmacy these days and you’ll notice that much of the merchandise is in locked plastic cases. Dishwasher pods, shaving cream, even shampoo bottles are locked up to reduce losses from what has become a shoplifting epidemic.<br />Two recent reports show the scope of the stealing. Business.org surveyed some 700 small businesses and found that 54% had an increase in shoplifting last year. Twenty-three percent said it happens daily. The National Retail Federation surveyed 61 medium to large retailers and found that organized retail crime cost an average of more than $700,000 per $1 billion in sales in 2020."
