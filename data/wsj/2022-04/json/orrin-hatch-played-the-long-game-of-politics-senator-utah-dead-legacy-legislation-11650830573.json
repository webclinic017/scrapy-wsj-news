    "body": "As the American body politic splintered over the past decade, some dedicated men and women worked to keep left and right together. This week we mourn one of those leaders. The “gentleman of the Senate” and one of the most prolific lawmakers in American history, Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, who died Saturday at 88.<br />I worked with Hatch for more than 15 years as Senate Judiciary Committee senior counsel and his final chief of staff. The man represented a generation of lawmakers brought up on the virtues of bipartisanship and compromise. He was beloved by colleagues on both sides of the aisle, making him an anomaly in polarized times."
