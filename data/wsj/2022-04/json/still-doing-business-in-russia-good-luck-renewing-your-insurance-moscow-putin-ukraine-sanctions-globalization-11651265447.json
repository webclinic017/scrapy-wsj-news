    "body": "More than 750 Western companies have left Russia since it invaded Ukraine. Some had no choice because their sectors fall under Western sanctions. Others have left voluntarily and been hailed for standing for democracy. Their departure may have another, less lofty reason: Russia is becoming uninsurable.<br />Insurance is necessary for globalization: It picks up the risk of operating in unstable environments, allowing companies to do business in a wider variety of places. Certain forms of insurance—such as cargo and liability—are mandatory for companies based in the West.  Other kinds of insurance are voluntary but vital to operating in less-stable nations. Political-risk insurance protects policyholders against sundry risks ranging from expropriation of assets to civil unrest. Such protection has enabled countless Western companies to set themselves up in Russia and continue to operate there even as Vladimir Putin’s regime became more capricious. Without insurance, it’s likely that some Western businesses would have left the country after Russian authorities’ 2011 raid of BP’s office in Moscow."
