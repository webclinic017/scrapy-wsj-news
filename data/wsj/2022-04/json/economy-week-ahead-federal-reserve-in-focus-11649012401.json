    "body": "Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s March meeting and remarks from Fed officials highlight a relatively light week for economic data.<br />The U.S. trade deficit hit a fresh record in January as consumers and businesses snapped up vehicles, energy supplies and other goods produced overseas.
