    "body": "President Biden has used the pandemic to justify doing by fiat what he can’t pass through Congress, including his eviction moratorium and vaccine mandate. Now his Administration is effectively canceling student debt on the installment plan.<br />That’s the import of the Administration’s announcement Wednesday that it is again extending the pause on student loan payments and interest accrual, this time through August. Mr. Biden said the economy is stronger than ever and the country can safely “return to more normal routines,” but student borrowers apparently still aren’t ready to return to making normal loan payments."
