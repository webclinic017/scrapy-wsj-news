    "body": "Prosecutors are inevitably going to lose some cases in our jury system, but they should win the big ones or confidence in honest justice declines. That explains the surprise, if not shock, on Friday when a federal jury failed to convict four men accused of conspiring to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.<br />The prosecutions made national headlines in 2020 as supposed evidence that political polarization may have been driving Americans to violent extremism. The indictments fit a popular media narrative, fed by Democrats, that right-wing radicals were prepared to commit terrorist acts."
