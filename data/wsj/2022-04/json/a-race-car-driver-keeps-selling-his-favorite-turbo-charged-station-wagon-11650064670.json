Baime.<br />I have always been an Audi fan, and I have owned many during my lifetime. To me, the holy grail of Audis is the RS 6 Avant station wagon. The RS stands for Rennsport, which means “racing sport” in German. It’s the highest expression of performance that Audi makes. And the Avant is Audi’s word for station wagon."
