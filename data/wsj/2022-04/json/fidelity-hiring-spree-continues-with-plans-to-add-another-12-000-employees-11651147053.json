    "body": "Fidelity Investments said it plans to hire another 12,000 people by September, doubling down on a bet that the individual-investing frenzy that began during the pandemic will outlast the marketâ€™s recent volatility.<br />The Boston financial firm expects to end the year with as many as 68,000 employees, up about 19% from the start of 2022, building on a hiring spree that began in late 2020. Fidelity hired 7,200 associates that year and another 16,600 in 2021. The bulk of the new hires will be in client-facing and technology roles."
