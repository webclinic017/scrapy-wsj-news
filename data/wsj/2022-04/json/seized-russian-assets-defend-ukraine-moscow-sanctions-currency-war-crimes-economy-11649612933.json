    "body": "As Russia began its war against Ukraine in late February, the central banks of the U.S., Japan, U.K., European Union and others froze more than $300 billion of Russia’s foreign-exchange reserves. These unprecedented actions helped undermine the ruble, which has since recovered due to reduced demand for hard currency resulting from the isolation of the Russian economy.<br />Regrettably, these and other important Western sanctions have done little to restrain Russian aggression. Indeed, Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine has resulted in widespread war crimes, the deliberate destruction and depopulation of Ukrainian cities, the displacement of some 11 million Ukrainians from their homes, and the deaths of many thousand Ukrainian civilians. As a result, the West recently has intensified its pressure on Moscow and is seeking new ways to compel Moscow to desist. In this context, Russia’s massive hard-currency reserves now frozen in Western accounts are a crucial asset that can be used to protect Ukraine and its sovereignty."
