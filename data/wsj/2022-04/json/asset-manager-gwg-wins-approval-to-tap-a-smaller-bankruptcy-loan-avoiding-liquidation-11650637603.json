    "body": "Asset manager  GWG Holdings Inc.  won court approval late Thursday to tap $10 million in financing even after a bankruptcy judge questioned the loan mechanics and suggested it had a better offer on the table.<br />Judge Marvin Isgur of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston allowed GWG to borrow the emergency loan from National Founders LP after the lender agreed to sweeten some terms. GWG, known for selling life-insurance bonds to individual investors, said in court papers that it needed the lifeline to avoid an imminent liquidation after filing for bankruptcy earlier this week."
