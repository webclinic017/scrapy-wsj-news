    "body": "BERLIN—Germany is coming under pressure from Western allies to beef up its response to Russia’s aggression, accept stronger sanctions against Moscow and send more weapons to Ukraine.<br />The U.S. and its closest allies in Europe are concerned that after an initially robust response, Berlin’s resolve in opposing Russia is seen as wavering because of economic concerns and skepticism that Ukraine can win the war. Some also think Berlin fears additional help for Ukraine and sanctions against Russia could undermine diplomatic efforts to end the conflict."
