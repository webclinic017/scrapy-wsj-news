    "body": "Flight attendants in the 1960s were, to a one, young, thin, single women. But did they have to be in order to do the job? When stewardesses, as they were then called, began appealing to the newly created Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to challenge the airlines’ discriminatory hiring practices, the airlines fought back, using what was known as the BFOQ loophole in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. They defended their right to hire only women and to fire them if they gained weight, married, got pregnant or entered their 30s, arguing that being a young, thin, single woman was, in fact, a “bona fide occupational qualification” for the position.<br />“It wouldn’t be much of an exaggeration to say that in the 1960s the airplane cabin was the most sexist workplace in America,” writes Nell McShane Wulfhart in “The Great Stewardess Rebellion.” Most passengers at midcentury were male business travelers; airlines believed that having young, pretty stewardesses gave them a competitive advantage. Ms. Wulfhart’s exhilarating account describes how a number of stewardesses, galvanized by the women’s movement, took on the airlines and won."
