    "body": "China’s electric-vehicle leader BYD is still speeding ahead against the headwind of rising material prices.<br />The Warren Buffett-backed Chinese auto maker reported stellar results for its latest quarter on Wednesday. Excluding its sluggish handset segment, net profit at BYD’s core business grew 38% from the previous quarter. That compared with losses a year earlier. It sold nearly three times as many cars as a year earlier while EV sales in China continued to boom. Profit margins slipped slightly but were better than expected."
