    "body": "The war in Ukraine has changed Europe in lasting ways. One key question policy makers will soon face is this: How should the U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization restructure and strengthen their military posture on NATO’s eastern flank?<br />NATO can count on more than three million troops, two million of whom are already in Europe, to defend a member nation against aggression. But most of these troops are based in their home territories. Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine this year, only slightly more than 10,000 troops from the alliance’s biggest and most powerful militaries were stationed on NATO’s frontlines with Russia."
