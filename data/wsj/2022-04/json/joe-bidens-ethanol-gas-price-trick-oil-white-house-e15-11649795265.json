    "body": "President Biden could reduce prices at the pump by unleashing the U.S. oil and gas industry. Instead he’s borrowing a trick from Donald Trump: Boosting Big Ethanol.<br />In Iowa on Tuesday, Mr. Biden announced an environmental waiver to allow sales of 15% ethanol gasoline blends (E15) this summer. The Clean Air Act prohibits this because higher ethanol blends can increase smog in hot weather. They can also erode older car engines, gas pumps, storage tanks and pipelines."
