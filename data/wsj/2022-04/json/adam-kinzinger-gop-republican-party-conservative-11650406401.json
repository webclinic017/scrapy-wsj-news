    "body": "Rep. Adam Kinzinger is “homeless” because he has become too moderate for his Republican Party and is not liberal enough for the Democratic Party (“A Political Homeless Shelter,” op-ed, April 18). Neither party will countenance less than rigid adhesion to party orthodoxy. He blames this on a public that is “more susceptible than ever” to falling for “untruths,” as if the public were sheep that could be herded in the correct political direction by leaders who speak out against the “outrage machine.”<br />Where he goes wrong is assuming that the public is unhappy with our political situation. We have “extreme partisanship” because voters keep electing partisan politicians. The country is divided and partisan; the politicians are a reflection of those views."
