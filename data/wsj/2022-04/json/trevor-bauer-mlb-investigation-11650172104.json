    "body": "Star pitcher Trevor Bauer hasn’t appeared in a game for the Los Angeles Dodgers since last June 28, the day before a sexual assault allegation against him first surfaced. More than nine months later, he is still on paid administrative leave, as Major League Baseball tries to determine whether or how to punish him.<br />Bauer’s position on the matter is clear: He believes that he has done nothing to merit a penalty under law or baseball’s code. If the league does try to suspend him under the sport’s “Joint Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault and Child Abuse Policy,” he could become the first player ever to mount a challenge to the decision. What happens next could establish a standard that shapes the handling of future incidents."
