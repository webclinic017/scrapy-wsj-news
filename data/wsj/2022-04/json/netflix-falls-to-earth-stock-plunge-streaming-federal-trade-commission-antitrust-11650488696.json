    "body": "Streaming stocks sold off Wednesday, led by  Netflix â€™s  35% plunge after it reported losing subscribers for the first time in a decade. Count this as another sign that the pandemic is coming to an end and a reminder to antitrust regulators that the streaming market is competitive and dynamic.<br />Netflix said it lost 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter and expects to lose two million in the second. Covid lockdowns boosted subscriptions across streaming platforms. Americans had more money to spend owing to pandemic transfer payments and fewer things to spend them on, so they spent on home entertainment."
