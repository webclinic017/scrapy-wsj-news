    "body": "The first quarter will be a messy one for Europe’s banks, but with the risk of an economic downturn rising things may only get messier.<br />In quarterly results this week,  Deutsche Bank ,   Barclays ,   UBS  and  Credit Suisse  will likely paint a mixed overall picture of the European banking sector. While the Russian invasion of Ukraine put the brakes on the recent investment banking boom, it also brought market volatility, particularly in commodities and interest-rate expectations. That will have helped some traders boost their revenues, but also comes with potentially higher capital requirements and risks such as mark-to-market writedowns or counterparty losses."
