    "body": "‘Based on the evidence, the Court finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021.” That sentence, from a Monday ruling by a federal judge, has echoed in the press, with the implication that Mr. Trump may soon be indicted.<br />Better tread carefully here. Judge David Carter’s sweeping statement is less than meets the eye. The narrow dispute in Judge Carter’s court was whether the House could access the emails of John Eastman, a former law professor who gave Mr. Trump awful legal guidance. If the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 riot takes his opinion as a reason to call for prosecuting Mr. Trump or his advisers, it could drag the country into a legal minefield and a political-revenge brawl more befitting a banana republic."
