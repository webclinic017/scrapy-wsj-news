    "body": "It’s not fashionable to talk about exchange rates at the Federal Reserve or most university economics departments these days, but an underreported economic story of late is the rapid ascent of the dollar. This is a challenge to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s battle against inflation, but it’s also an opportunity for politicians who want to show they take inflation seriously.<br />Dollar strength now is impossible to ignore. On Monday it hit a 20-year high against the Japanese yen when the yen approached ¥127 per dollar. Some traders believe it could hit ¥130. (The higher the rate, the weaker the yen.) The euro has fallen below $1.08 in recent days from a one-year high above $1.20 last May, and parity with the dollar is possible. Britain’s pound sterling trades near $1.30, down from above $1.40 last year."
