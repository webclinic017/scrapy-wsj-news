    "body": "In “Biden’s Better Plan to Tax the Rich” (op-ed, March 29), Jason Furman’s argument is based on highly questionable premises. To begin, unrealized gains do not “escape taxation at death.” Estate taxes of 40% are collected on the full value of assets, including unrealized gains.<br />Next is the implication that somehow we will be better off transferring capital-allocation decisions from the likes of Warren Buffett, Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Stephen Schwarzman to the likes of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Finally is Mr. Furman’s point that this proposal will make our tax system raise revenue in a “more progressive manner,” overlooking that the U.S. tax code is already among the most progressive in the world."
