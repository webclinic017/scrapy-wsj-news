    "body": "Americans understand that an attack on one ally in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an attack on all. If Russia bombed Warsaw, Washington would be obligated to come to its aid. But if Pearl Harbor were attacked again, this rule wouldn’t compel U.S. allies to help.<br />Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty covers only Europe and parts of North America north of the Tropic of Cancer. Swathes of member countries’ land, such as Puerto Rico and French Polynesia, fall outside the pact. At NATO’s birth in 1949, this limit served to exempt far-flung colonies. Amid Russia’s war in Ukraine and Chinese saber-rattling, NATO’s self-imposed geographic limits absent the alliance from the Indo-Pacific and weaken it in the Atlantic."
