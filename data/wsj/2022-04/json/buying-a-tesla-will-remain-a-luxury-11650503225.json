    "body": "Tesla  is doing very well—so well you might wonder why it has been raising prices so aggressively.<br />The electric-vehicle pioneer on Wednesday reported yet another record quarter for profits, far ahead of analyst forecasts, despite delivering a similar number of cars to customers. The explanation is a combination of price increases and, given the backdrop of soaring commodity prices, surprisingly low inflation in its bill of materials. Teslas sold for an average price of about $52,200—up 2.9% compared with the fourth quarter—while their average cost rose 1.7% to $36,500."
