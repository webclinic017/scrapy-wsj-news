    "body": "WASHINGTON—The International Monetary Fund said Tuesday it expects global economic growth to slow significantly this year as the repercussions of the war in Ukraine spread world-wide, a setback for many nations already grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic and rising inflation and interest rates.<br />The IMF sees the world’s economy expanding 3.6% this year, down from 6.1% last year. The new forecast is 0.8 percentage point lower than its projection in January and a 1.3 point cut from its October 2021 outlook."
