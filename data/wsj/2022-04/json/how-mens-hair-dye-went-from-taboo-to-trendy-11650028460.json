    "body": "LAST NOVEMBER, Sameer Sadhu dyed his black mop a mauve so rich it would make Barney the dinosaur jealous. Though Mr. Sadhu, 34, a New York music executive, said he woke up one morning yearning to try a loud shade, his purple plan wasn’t totally out of the blue. His wife had been contemplating dyeing her hair and he guesses she “put a little seed” in his head that eventually took root. He and his colorist decided lavender would best complement his skin tone, said Mr. Sadhu, who is South Asian. While the hue handily hides his grays, he’s more stoked by the “sense of adventure” it inspires.<br />Mr. Sadhu has joined a growing flock of men whose dyed crests resemble birds of paradise. These adventurous gents treat their hair like an accessory, switching colors—aqua! chartreuse! beet red!—as easily as some guys change sneakers. Other men pursue a more low-key dye agenda, opting for approachable, natural-looking shades that diminish—or enhance—their grays."
