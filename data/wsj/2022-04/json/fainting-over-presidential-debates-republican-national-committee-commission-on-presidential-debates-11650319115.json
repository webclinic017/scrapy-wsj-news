    "body": "It’s official: Republicans are abandoning the Commission on Presidential Debates. That’s the group of Washington grandees formed in 1987 to set the terms of the televised sparring every four years. After signaling its intent for months, the Republican National Committee voted unanimously last week to withdraw.<br />The usual suspects are hyping this as a GOP attack on democracy and the American way. Where’s the fainting couch? The reality is that sidelining the debate commission will merely put presidential campaigns back in charge. Debate topics and formats will be up for negotiation between the Republican and Democratic nominees."
