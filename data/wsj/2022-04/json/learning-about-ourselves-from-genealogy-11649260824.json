    "body": "Genealogy can easily be a narcissistic endeavor, steeped in self-aggrandizement, a way of making false connections and eliminating undesired ones. Kings have used it to exalt themselves, tyrants to decide which people to purge. Whether or not Jesus the man really was descended from King David, his disciples so desired him to have that pedigree that two of the gospels purport to trace it in incompatible ways.<br />And so ridicule of genealogy also has a long history, one that over the millennia has run alongside the practice itself. Plato mocked those who believed themselves to be “of noble birth, because [they] can show seven wealthy ancestors.” Everyone, he wrote in the 4th century B.C., “has had countless thousands of ancestors and progenitors, among whom have been in any instance rich and poor, kings and slaves.” This kind of derision is evergreen. “Genealogy? That’s like those people who believe in past lives, isn’t it?” a friend of the journalist Christine Kenneally asked her when she was writing “The Invisible History of the Human Race.” “And they’re always Cleopatra, never an anonymous slave.”"
