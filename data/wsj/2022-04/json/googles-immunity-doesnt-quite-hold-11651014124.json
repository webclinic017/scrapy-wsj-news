    "body": "Google is resilient, but it isn’t bulletproof.<br />First-quarter results from parent company  Alphabet Inc.  on Tuesday afternoon showed that the world’s largest online advertising company is hardly immune to the pressures being felt by others in the sector. Total advertising revenue grew 22% year over year to $54.7 billion, but still fell shy of the $55 billion expected by Wall Street. The main culprit was YouTube, where ad revenue of nearly $6.9 billion fell about 8% short of the $7.4 billion analysts were expecting. YouTube’s ad revenue also saw substantial deceleration, growing 14% on year in the most recent quarter compared with 25% growth in the December period and 49% growth in last year’s first quarter."
