    "body": "In no sense now can Vladimir Putin be allowed to win in Ukraine. People shouldn’t have to be shot in the back of the head with their hands tied behind them to make that clear, but such is history’s record of humanity slow-walking counterattacks against mass slaughter.<br />Mr. Putin was going to defeat Ukraine quickly. Now he isn’t. But he can still win if the West’s commitments to Ukraine, however impressive, produce a frozen conflict, as Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley predicted to Congress Tuesday when he said the conflict could last “years for sure.” Time like that is Mr. Putin’s friend because he has Stalin’s stomach for death, and eventually we won’t."
