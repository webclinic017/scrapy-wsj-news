    "body": "It was just two years ago but seems like a galaxy far, far away when hand sanitizer was seemingly worth its weight in gold. Now that supplies have caught up and Covid-19 is understood to be a respiratory disease, it takes a bit of marketing to even move the stuff off the shelves. And who has better brands to do so than  Disney ?<br />That might no longer be the case, though, at least when it comes to hygiene, after two different hand sanitizers using the entertainment giant’s trademarks and sold at three U.S. national retail chains were recalled. WDW News Today, a repository of all manner of stories about Disney, reports that Mandalorian hand sanitizer, which has a picture of Baby Yoda from the hit show, wasn’t safe for human little ones."
