    "body": "Mississippi residents have the highest obesity rate in the U.S., but the state is about to shed a few regulatory pounds. Raise your protein shake to personal trainer Donna Harris and her lawyers at the Mississippi Justice Institute.<br />Effective May 16, the Mississippi State Department of Health will no longer require residents who don’t claim to be dieticians to get a dietician’s license before they can offer non-medical weight-control services. The reform is part of a settlement with Ms. Harris, who was targeted by state regulators."
