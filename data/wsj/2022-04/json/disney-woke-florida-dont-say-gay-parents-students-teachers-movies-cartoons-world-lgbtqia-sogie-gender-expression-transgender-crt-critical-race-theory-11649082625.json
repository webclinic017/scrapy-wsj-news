    "body": "If executives of the Walt  Disney Co.  are serious about tackling the endemic poison of cisgendered-white-patriarchal ideology in our wicked society, it’s high time they revisited their enormous back-catalog of works that have promoted this pernicious propaganda for too long.<br />It is not enough to start making movies that reflect and celebrate our modern sexual mores, as we have learned lately is their intent. They need to make urgent reparations for the pollution they have poured into the impressionable minds of young children over the first disgraceful century of the company’s existence."
