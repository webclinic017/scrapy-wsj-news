    "body": "In the landscape of American political history John Jay and his descendants may perhaps seem like lesser outcroppings, overshadowed by the cliff-like profiles of more prominent men. But their role in the formation of the early republic—and in America’s evolving self-definition over time—was a crucial one. In David Gellman, a historian at DePauw University, they have at last found a superb though not uncritical chronicler. “Liberty’s Chain: Slavery, Abolition, and the Jay Family of New York” brings into sharp focus three generations of one of the nation’s most remarkable families.<br />Mr. Gellman is primarily concerned with the Jays’ tangled relation to slavery and antislavery. In this way, his clear-eyed narrative will undoubtedly take its place alongside other studies with a similar theme—for instance, Henry Wiencek’s “An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America” (2003) and Annette Gordon-Reed’s “The Hemingses of Monticello” (2008). In the Jays’ case, the time-frame stretches beyond the founding era—and far beyond the legal demise of slavery in the Jays’ home state of New York."
