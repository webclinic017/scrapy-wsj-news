    "body": "China  Evergrande  Group and some of its biggest offshore creditors have reached agreement on moving restructuring talks forward, helping stave off their threats of taking over the company’s offshore businesses after $2 billion in offshore cash was seized by banks, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />Evergrande agreed in principle late last week to pay bondholders’ advisory fees, provide additional due diligence on the company’s financial health, and give creditors a formal role in the restructuring process, the people familiar with the matter said. The fee- and information-sharing agreement is seen as a moderate step in the right direction rather than substantial progress to restructure Evergrande’s debt, one of the people said."
