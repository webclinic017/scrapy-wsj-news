    "body": "The Internal Revenue Service is investigating  American Express Co.  over a questionable tax break that it pitched to clients, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The civil investigation has been under way for a few months, these people said. The Wall Street Journal reported in November that AmEx salespeople touted a tax break based on a shaky interpretation of tax law. The pitch was part of a strategy to persuade business owners to sign up for costly payment services."
