    "body": "Has streaming peaked?  Netflix  stock dropped 37% last week after the company’s loss of subscribers, and CNN+ was dead on arrival. Are viewers finally revolting? Maybe it’s the shows and content. It’s hard to find a movie, series or newscast that doesn’t push a social or political agenda, from “Bridgerton” to “Squid Game” and “The Handmaid’s Tale.” Even formerly family friendly  Disney  is getting too preachy. Elon Musk calls this the “woke mind virus.”<br />The agenda list is too long, so I’ll focus on the current rash of shows about entrepreneurs: Showtime’s “Super Pumped” on Travis Kalanick and Uber;  Apple  TV’s “WeCrashed” on Adam and Rebekah Neumann and  WeWork ; and Hulu’s “The Dropout” on Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos. Their debuts curiously coincided with the Netflix’s “Inventing Anna” about the con artist Anna Sorokin. Hollywood seems to equate entrepreneurs with scammers, almost as if filmmakers have a vendetta against success."
