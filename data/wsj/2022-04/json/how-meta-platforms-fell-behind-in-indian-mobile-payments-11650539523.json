    "body": "Mark Zuckerberg has pinned his hopes on commerce to save his business from stagnating user engagement and decelerating advertising revenue growth. But in the massive market of India, Facebook parent company  Meta Platforms  has fallen far behind in mobile payments, which serve as the crucial last step in closing an online sale.<br />It needs to get its act together quickly if it doesn’t want to lose out to Google and  Walmart  in the race for controlling digital payments in the world’s second-largest internet market.  Meta  has a popular mobile messaging platform in the country with WhatsApp, which has its own local payment service. But so far, the encrypted messaging app has been at loggerheads with the Indian government over multiple issues, all of which are likely impacting its payment ambitions in India."
