    "body": "Augmented reality could completely change how you shop, but don’t expect it to dramatically change where you do it.<br />For a second there, it looked like bricks-and-mortar shopping would become a permanent casualty of the pandemic. E-commerce business boomed. Platforms like  Shopify  empowered physical stores to move online and consumers to purchase goods in just a few clicks.
