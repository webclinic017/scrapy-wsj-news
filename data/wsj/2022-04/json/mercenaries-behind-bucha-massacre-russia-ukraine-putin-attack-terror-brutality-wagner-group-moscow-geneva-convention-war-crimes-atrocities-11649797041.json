    "body": "Germany’s foreign-intelligence service recently intercepted secret messages confirming Russian mercenaries known as the Wagner Group played a leading role in the massacre in Bucha, Ukraine. For those who track the Wagner Group, this was expected. In recent years, it has become Vladimir Putin’s weapon of choice because it offers plausible deniability. Hiring mercenaries is a foolproof way to confound international laws prohibiting savagery in war. The Wagner Group has left a trail of atrocities everywhere it’s gone: Syria, Libya, the Central African Republic, Mali and now Ukraine. And other nations are following Moscow’s example.<br />It’s impossible to know for certain whether the Wagner Group’s brutality is the work of rogue warriors or Russian policy, but it is plausible it’s the latter. Coercion and terror are a time-tested imperial strategy for pacification, from the First Jewish-Roman War (66-73) to the Second Chechen War (1999-2000), during which Mr. Putin flattened Grozny. When the fighting was over, the city looked like Stalingrad after the Nazi’s five-month siege—post-apocalyptic, with only skeletal buildings left standing and scorched rubble burying unknown dead. Immoral but effective, Mr. Putin’s bombardment ended the war in Russia’s favor."
