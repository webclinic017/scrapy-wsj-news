    "body": "Ukraine won the battle of Kyiv in heroic fashion, but the war is set to enter a bloody new phase as Vladimir Putin prepares an offensive in the east. The question is whether President Biden will summon the mettle to make sure America’s friends win.<br />The Biden Administration on Wednesday announced $800 million more in weapons, ammunition and other security assistance for Ukraine, calling it “tailored to the wider assault we expect Russia to launch in eastern Ukraine.” The awful images coming out of Mariupol are a sign of what is to come, and the miracle is that the city’s defenders have managed to hold out as long as they have. Mr. Putin said this week that peace talks have reached a dead end."
