    "body": "Credit Suisse  Group AG shareholders revolted Friday, refusing to clear executives of legal liability from recent financial mishaps, even as the bank’s chairman and chief executive sought to reassure shareholders the institution can change its culture and turn a corner.<br />In what is normally a routine vote to insulate bank officials from lawsuits, around 60% of voted shares went against Credit Suisse for discharging them from legal liability in 2020. The binding vote highlights investors’ deep dissatisfaction with scandal-prone Credit Suisse, including the more than $5 billion it lost from family office Archegos Capital Management’s soured stock positions."
