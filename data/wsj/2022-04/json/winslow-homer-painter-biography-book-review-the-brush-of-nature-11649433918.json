    "body": "The painter Winslow Homer was a man of few words. He kept no journals. He burned most of his correspondence. He also never married, ensuring that no heirs would survive to recount the details of his private life.<br />What Homer left behind was his art: thousands of illustrations for 19th-century newspapers and magazines, and the stately, often shimmering paintings in oil and watercolor for which he is now best remembered. This oeuvre, in its entirety, not only chronicles a nation in rapid transformation during and after the Civil War. It also stands as a personal testament to a new way of viewing existence. Stripped of the idealism that characterized his parents’ generation, Homer confronted the world around him with curiosity and a stoic acceptance."
