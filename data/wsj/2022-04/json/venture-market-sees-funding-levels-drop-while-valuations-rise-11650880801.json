    "body": "After setting a feverish investing pace last year, venture capitalists took their foot off the gas in this yearâ€™s first quarter. At the same time, valuations largely continued to rise, a dynamic that is causing some investors to expect a price drop for startups this year.<br />Investors committed $144 billion to startups globally in the first quarter, down 19% from the prior quarter, which is the largest percentage decline since the third quarter of 2012, according to analytics firm CB Insights. The number of deals completed also dropped, falling 5% compared with the fourth quarter to 8,835."
