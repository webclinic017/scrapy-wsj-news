    "body": "The decline of Hong Kong’s rule of law continues under Chinese Communist Party pressure, and this week two prominent British judges resigned from the city’s top court in protest.<br />For decades the Court of Final Appeal has included judges from other common law jurisdictions. These foreign judges are supposed to protect judicial independence. But that job has become increasingly untenable since China imposed national-security legislation to outlaw dissent in 2020."
