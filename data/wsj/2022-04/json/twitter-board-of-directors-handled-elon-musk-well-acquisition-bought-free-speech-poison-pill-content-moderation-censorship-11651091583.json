    "body": "Let’s hear it for  Twitter ’s  board of directors. Given the considerable drama surrounding Elon Musk’s bid for the company, it is easy to overlook the board’s skillful handling of his approach.<br />In early April, when Mr. Musk initially disclosed his acquisition of slightly more than 9% of the company’s shares, the board responded by offering him a seat. This elegant move acknowledged the right of a major shareholder to influence the company’s direction and also would have hindered Mr. Musk’s ability to criticize the company publicly. That he ultimately turned this offer down doesn’t mean the board was unwise to offer it."
