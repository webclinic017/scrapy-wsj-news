    "body": "The Major League Baseball lockout delayed Opening Day until April 7 this year. I passed on attending. Long ago in grad school, I postponed graduating until August so my neighbor and I could do a driving baseball trip. The schedule was almost perfect: a game in St. Louis, the next night Kansas City, then Seattle, the Bay Area, Southern California and Dallas. Right as we were about to leave, the players went on strike. Aargh! Ultimately 713 games were canceled in 1981. I’ve never forgiven the players or their union.<br />I’m still a fan. Back in my New York days, I tried and failed to get tickets to opening day at Shea Stadium between the St. Louis Cardinals and the New York Mets. Fortunately, I scrounged up tickets for the next day. Rodney Dangerfield threw out the first pitch—marketed as “No Respect Opening Day.” Just my speed."
