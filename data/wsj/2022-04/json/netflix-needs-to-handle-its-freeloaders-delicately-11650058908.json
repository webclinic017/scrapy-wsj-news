    "body": "As  Netflix  looks to shift gears with investors, it may find the need to do something about those who are getting a free ride.<br />When the streaming pioneer posts first-quarter results on Tuesday, the figures may show one of its weakest periods in years in terms of paid-subscriber growth. Netflix projected 2.5 million net additions for the quarter when it last reported results in late January, but that was before war broke out in Ukraine, which has driven Netflix and many other companies to suspend their business activities in Russia. John Blackledge of  Cowen  now expects Netflix to add only about 1.5 million new subscribers in the quarter."
