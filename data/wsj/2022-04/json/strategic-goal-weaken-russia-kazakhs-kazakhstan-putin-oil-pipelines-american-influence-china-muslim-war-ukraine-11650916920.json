    "body": "Almaty, Kazakhstan<br />Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has exposed deep failures in Russian strategic culture and undermined Russian prestige across the West. Viewed from Almaty, in the foothills of the Tian Shan mountains, however, the Russian leader looms large. It is not only that Moscow’s propaganda still shapes the worldview of Kazakhstan’s sizable Russian minority (about 20% of the population, heavily concentrated in regions adjacent to Russia). This also has been a year that, for many in Kazakhstan, underlined how much power Russia has over the future of this oil- and mineral-rich Central Asian country."
