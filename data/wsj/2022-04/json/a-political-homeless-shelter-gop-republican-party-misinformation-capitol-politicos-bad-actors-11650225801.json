    "body": "America is at a crossroads. Politically speaking, so am I.<br />The Republican Party I joined decades ago is unrecognizable today. It has favored conspiracy theories over truth, anger over hope, and division over problem solving. As I serve my final months in Congress, I find I am left carrying the torch for the values and principles of a party that’s been overtaken by partisan politicos looking for the limelight and clinging to their sense of power instead of upholding their oaths of office. I’m holding out hope for what I know the Republican Party has been and can be, but every day that passes, I’m feeling more politically homeless. And I’m not alone."
