    "body": "Your editorial “Rewriting Labor Law by Fiat” (April 12) rightly excoriates National Labor Relations Board counsel Jennifer Abruzzo for her attempt to suppress the free-speech rights of private employers. She would prevent them from holding meetings to speak with employees about the implications of unionization. Ironically, the exact opposite behavior is often sanctioned in the public sector.<br />Here in Washington, a state law allows government-employee unions to conduct a 30-minute meeting with each new hire, during which workers are subjected to a high-pressure pitch to join the union designated as the agency’s sole bargaining representative. The arm-twisting sessions are technically voluntary, but that information is rarely shared with the workers."
