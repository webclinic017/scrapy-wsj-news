    "body": "Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer was suspended without pay for 324 games under Major League Baseball’s domestic-violence policy, an unprecedented punishment representing two full seasons for one of the highest-paid players in the sport’s history.<br />The discipline comes about 10 months after a California woman accused Bauer of sexually assaulting her. Bauer, 31-years-old, has said that he had “consensual rough sex” with the woman but that he only acted within previously established parameters. Prosecutors in California didn’t file charges against Bauer after an investigation earlier this year."
