    "body": "Inflation accelerated in March to its fastest pace since 1982, measured by the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge, as the Ukraine war pushed up energy prices and supply problems and strong U.S. consumer demand persisted.<br />Consumer prices rose 6.6% in March from a year before, up from February’s revised 6.3% increase, as measured by the Commerce Department’s personal-consumption expenditures price index, which it reported Friday. The March rise was the fastest since January 1982."
