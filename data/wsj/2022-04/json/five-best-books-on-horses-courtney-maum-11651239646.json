    "body": "By C.E. Morgan (2016)<br />1. This sweeping novel unfolds on the southern side of the Ohio River, where the revered Forge family is fighting to breed, train and race a filly in the Kentucky Derby. Henry is the patriarch, a believer in God and natural selection, a man dead set on convincing his daughter Henrietta that inbreeding is the best way to make a winning racehorse. Henrietta pushes for diversification, reminding Henry that a thoroughbred’s own hybridization is one of the reasons for its strength. When Henrietta hires an African-American ex-convict named Allmon Shaughnessy to help prepare their prize mount, Hellsmouth, the result is a multigenerational Southern saga as appealing as the champion thoroughbreds the Forges raise."
