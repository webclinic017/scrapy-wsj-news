    "body": "The Soviet invasion of Finland in November 1939 is strikingly similar to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Russia is now making many of the same mistakes as in its earlier military failure. Finland had been under Swedish and Russian rule until 1918; Ukraine didn’t break away from the Soviet Union until 1991. Both countries had recently gained their precious independence and were determined to fight for it.<br />The same tragic elements have appeared in both wars: faulty Russian intelligence, misguided expectations of a rapid victory with few casualties, brutal invasion of a weaker country, bombardment of cities, assaults on civilians, poor training, inadequate supplies, low morale, reluctance to fight, humiliating defeats, universal condemnation, lack of allied intervention, and exposure of military weakness. A brief account of the Finnish war illuminates these parallels."
