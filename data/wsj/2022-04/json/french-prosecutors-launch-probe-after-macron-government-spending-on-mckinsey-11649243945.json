    "body": "PARIS—French prosecutors have opened a tax-fraud and money-laundering investigation stemming from a Senate report on government spending on consulting firms, delivering a blow to President Emmanuel Macron just days before voters head to the polls.<br />France’s financial prosecutors issued a brief statement Wednesday saying they were probing the findings of a Senate report published last month. The report detailed how the government spent 893.9 million euros, equivalent to $975.8 million, last year on consultants, including McKinsey & Co. That was a sizable increase on the €379.1 million spent in 2018, Mr. Macron’s first full year in power, the report said."
