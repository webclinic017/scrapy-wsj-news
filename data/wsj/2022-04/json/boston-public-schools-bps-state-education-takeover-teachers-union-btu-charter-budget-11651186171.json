    "body": "Regarding Roger Lowenstein’s “Massachusetts May Take Control of Boston’s Public Schools” (Cross Country, April 23): I covered Massachusetts’s Education Department for nine years for Bay State Parent magazine, and it doesn’t exactly have a sterling record when it comes to running public schools. Jeff Riley, prior to becoming the department’s top executive, oversaw the Lawrence, Mass., public schools when the state took them over. Based on the MCAS standardized test, Boston is outperforming Lawrence.<br />The MCAS has been given since 1998. The only thing it consistently shows is that students from upper-income communities, as well as those who are Asian and white, perform better on the test than those from lower-income communities, or those who are African-American and Latino."
