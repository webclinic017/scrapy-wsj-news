    "body": "During Lent, I have stepped up my reading about the lives of Christian saints. The exercise has been strangely dispiriting, not because their virtue isn’t heroic, but because it’s so heroic. This is especially true for the lives of the martyrs, those who died for their faith.<br />Consider St. Lawrence, the third-century deacon who was grilled alive under order of Roman Emperor Valerian. He reportedly told his torturers, “Turn me over; I’m done on this side.” Or St. Thomas More, King Henry VIII’s lord chancellor, who joked with his executioner in 1535 that more assistance would be needed up to the scaffold than down from it."
