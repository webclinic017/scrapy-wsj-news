    "body": "Travel back three-quarters of a century, cross a border, imagine a world of fedoras and streetcars. There are smoked-meat sandwiches on warm plates and shivering commuters on cold corners. It is Montreal in 1946. Mobsters rule the street, the Catholic Church rules the soul. The mayor, who had encouraged Quebeckers not to register for the World War II draft, has won back his office after being sent to an internment camp for sedition. French and English mingle in the pâtisseries; furriers and longshoremen mingle by the river.<br />It was in postwar Montreal that the man who would break baseball’s “colour barrier”—that is how the word was spelled in Montreal’s morning Gazette and afternoon Star—began his star turn. Jackie and Rachel Robinson, known as the couple noir, lived on Avenue de Gaspé in the francophone neighborhood of Villeray. He took public transportation to the ballpark."
