    "body": "There is nothing like flashing some green to excite energy investors these days, so long as it is the hue of cold, hard cash.<br />Exxon Mobil ’s  first quarter was something of a mixed bag. The company posted a quarterly net profit of $5.5 billion the first quarter, well short of the $9.5 billion analysts polled by Visible Alpha had been penciling in. The big gap was due to a hefty after-tax charge related to Exxon’s exit from Russia (which accounted for less than 2% of production last year), but even without that impact, its earnings would have been about $700 million below expectations."
