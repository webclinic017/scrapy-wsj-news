    "body": "The European Union has proposed sanctioning two daughters of President Vladimir Putin, according to diplomats familiar with the plan, a move that would add the Russian leader’s closest family members to a growing list of individuals sanctioned in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.<br />EU member states still must approve the sanctions, which are among dozens of newly proposed, targeted travel bans and asset freezes against Russian business people, politicians, officials and their families. EU officials announced details of other new sanctions earlier Tuesday. They include a ban on imports of Russian coal, slashing the access of Russian road carriers and ships into the bloc, restrictions aimed at oligarchs and their families, and the blocking of some high-technology machinery exports."
