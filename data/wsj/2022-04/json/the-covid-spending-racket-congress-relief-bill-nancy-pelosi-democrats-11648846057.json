    "body": "President Biden and Members of Congress applauded themselves for passing a $1.5 trillion spending bill last month. Now they’re demanding a Covid spending encore.<br />“Congress, please act. You have to act immediately,” Mr. Biden pleaded this week. “The consequences of inaction are severe.” His Administration warns that monoclonal antibodies and antivirals will soon run out, and booster shots might not be available this fall if Congress doesn’t provide more money."
