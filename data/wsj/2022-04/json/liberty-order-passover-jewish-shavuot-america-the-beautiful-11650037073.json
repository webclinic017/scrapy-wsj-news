    "body": "Regarding William Galston’s “Passover and the Constitution” (Politics & Ideas, April 13): The rabbis of the Mishnah describe Shavuot (Pentecost), the festival that celebrates the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai, as atzeret, or conclusion—the conclusion of Passover. As the rabbis understood, true freedom involves the acceptance of personal and communal responsibility. This is exactly what Katharine Lee Bates meant when she wrote, “Confirm thy soul in self-control, thy liberty in law.” It is a lesson that is both timely and timeless.<br />Rabbi Norman Patz"
