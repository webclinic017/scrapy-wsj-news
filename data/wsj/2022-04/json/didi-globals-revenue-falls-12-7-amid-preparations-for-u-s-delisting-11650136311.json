    "body": "Didi Global Inc.  said Saturday its fourth-quarter revenue fell 12.7% from the same period a year earlier as the ride-hailing firm, under a cybersecurity investigation by Chinese regulators, prepares to delist from the New York Stock Exchange.<br />The Chinese ride-hailing company, based in Beijing, separately said it would hold a shareholders meeting May 23 to vote on its delisting from the NYSE. To cooperate with the continuing cybersecurity probe, Didi said, it won’t seek a public listing elsewhere before the U.S. delisting is completed."
