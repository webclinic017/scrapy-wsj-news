    "body": "PARIS—In issuing arrest warrants for Carlos Ghosn and four others, French prosecutors have zeroed in on around 15 million euros, equivalent to $16.2 million, of bonus payments from auto maker  Renault SA  to an Omani dealership they suspect ended up in companies controlled by Mr. Ghosn and his family, according to people familiar with the matter.<br />The arrest warrants, issued Thursday, are the latest twist in a yearslong saga that began in November 2018, when Japanese police arrested Mr. Ghosn, then leading both Renault and its car-building alliance partner  Nissan Motor Co.  Japanese prosecutors initially accused him of underreporting his pay before also charging him with more serious financial crimes. Mr. Ghosn has denied any wrongdoing, and fled Japan in December 2019, hidden in a music-equipment box, ahead of a planned criminal trial. He remains a fugitive in Lebanon. French investigators opened their own probe into his time at Renault."
