    "body": "Is real estate a haven from inflation? It depends. Todayâ€™s rates may be too high for certain types of property to offer much protection against rising prices.<br />Real estate has a long history as an inflation hedge, based on the principle that income generated by buildings tends to keep pace with consumer prices. One study by commercial real estate services firm  CBRE  found that rents in the U.K. grew in line with inflation from 1981 to 2020. However, the results were very mixed depending on the type of property. Of the 14 real estate subsectors in the study, half experienced a fall in real rents."
