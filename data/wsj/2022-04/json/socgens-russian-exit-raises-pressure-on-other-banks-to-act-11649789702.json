    "body": "It is rare that a billion-dollar write down prompts a stock price rise. Such is the conundrum faced by Russian-exposed European banks and their shareholders.<br />Until recently there were three European banks with significant exposure to Russia:  UniCredit ,  Raiffeisen and  Société Générale .  On Monday, Société Générale announced it was leaving Russia, prompting a €3.1 billion write down, equivalent to $3.4 billion. Its shares rose 5% on the day. Société Générale’s exit increases the pressure on peers to follow suit."
