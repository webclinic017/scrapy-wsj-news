    "body": "Buffeted by continuing losses, Gabe Plotkin’s Melvin Capital Management plans to shrink and take the unusual step of starting to charge incentive fees again even though clients remain significantly underwater on their investments.<br />Melvin, which was burned badly in the meme-stock rally last year, plans to shrink to $5 billion from the $8.7 billion it managed at the end of March, according to a letter the hedge fund sent to clients Thursday that was viewed by The Wall Street Journal. The fund is also making a raft of other changes in the terms of its agreements with investors, Melvin told clients."
