    "body": "President Biden is willing to say the Russians are committing genocide in Ukraine, but he won’t say his goal there is to defeat Russia or Vladimir Putin. Because the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s rule of thumb for the conflict is not to “provoke Putin,” the Ukrainians’ valiant fight has had to operate in a policy twilight zone with a goal between not-quite-losing and not-quite-winning.<br />Russia is now exploiting this ambivalence, warning the U.S. in a formal protest note days ago to stop sending Ukraine advanced systems or there will be “unpredictable consequences.” In other words: Let us win."
