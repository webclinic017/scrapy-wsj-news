    "body": "Amateurs complain about high gas prices. Pros worry about middle distillates.<br />Surging oil prices, high demand and logistical challenges have caused nosebleed prices for the refined products that keep the world running, from jet fuel to diesel. Steps taken by the White House and some states to shield consumers at the pump wonâ€™t keep shortages of other transport fuels from stoking inflation in everything from airplane tickets to food at the supermarket. Normally there are silver linings from a surge in energy costs for companies that haul goods around the country. Not this time."
