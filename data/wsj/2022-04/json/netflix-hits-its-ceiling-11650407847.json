    "body": "When it comes to streaming, 222 million seems to be the new sound barrier.<br />Paid subscribers to  Netflix  would have just surpassed that number if not for the company’s suspension of its service in Russia during the first quarter. Including that impact, Netflix actually saw quarterly paid subscribers fall for the first time in years. The company also used its first-quarter report Tuesday afternoon to project an even bigger drop of 2 million subscribers during the second quarter, which will incidentally include the newest season of “Stranger Things”—one of its most popular shows."
