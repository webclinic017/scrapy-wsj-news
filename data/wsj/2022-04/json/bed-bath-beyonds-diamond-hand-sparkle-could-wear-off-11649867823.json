That might not matter for the stock as long as an activist investor keeps his base of retail-investing fans on board.<br />In premarket trading, Bed Bath & Beyond’s disappointing results, reported Wednesday, were enough to send the company’s share price back down below where they were before billionaire Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohenrevealed a large stake in the company.
