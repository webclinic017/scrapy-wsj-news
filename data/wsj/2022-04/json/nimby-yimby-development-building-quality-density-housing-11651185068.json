    "body": "“Housing Costs Spur the ‘Yimby’ Movement” (U.S. News, April 20) provides a false choice between those who want development (Yimby: “yes in my backyard”) and those who don’t (Nimby: “not in my backyard”).<br />Shrewd politicians will favor a third approach: Quimby (“quality in my backyard”). One of the primary objections to high-density development is that in comparison with surroundings, it is usually too large, aesthetically disappointing and cheaper in construction quality. Some of the most beloved U.S. neighborhoods were built in the 1920s, and they included high-density development that wasn’t too large, was aesthetically rewarding and of similar or higher quality than surrounding development. That would work much better today than the anything-goes Yimby approach."
