    "body": "Billions of dollars of foreign and domestic energy investments in Mexico are at stake Tuesday, when the country’s Supreme Court issues its ruling on the constitutionality of a 2021 electricity law that stifles competition. Yet the significance of the decision will go well beyond pesos and centavos.<br />Through its ruling, the high court will signal whether it is still independent or if it has become a tool of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. If it’s the latter, Mexico’s democracy will be swinging by a thread, if it survives at all."
