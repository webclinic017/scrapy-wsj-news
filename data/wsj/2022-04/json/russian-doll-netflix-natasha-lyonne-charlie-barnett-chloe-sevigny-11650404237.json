    "body": "A seven-part documentary on Vladimir Putin’s sex life? Nyet. “Russian Doll,” season 2, marks a return to the New York surreal-estate of Nadia Vulvokov (Natasha Lyonne), the hipper-than-thou habitué of the East Village who discovered back in 2019 that the only thing worse than death was a death that never ended: Regularly popping out of her season-long 36th birthday party, she suffered a series of lethal accidents, returning each time to the scene of the existential crime.<br />You can’t say that matters were resolved, exactly, at the end of season 1, even though Nadia and Alan (Charlie Barnett), her lone fellow traveler, reconciled their time loops and wound up in the same place and moment. As season 2 begins, Nadia, now turning 40, finds herself in an even more multiverse-ial conundrum after she gets aboard a subway car where almost everyone is smoking (under the nose of a cop with a German shepherd) and there are ads for “Cats” and “Sophie’s Choice”: It’s a 6 train stuck in 1982, though why there’s no graffiti is a mystery. (It does show up in episode 2.) Another question is why, when Nadia catches her reflection in a window, she sees her mother, Nora (Chloë Sevigny), who is pregnant. With whom? You might well ask."
