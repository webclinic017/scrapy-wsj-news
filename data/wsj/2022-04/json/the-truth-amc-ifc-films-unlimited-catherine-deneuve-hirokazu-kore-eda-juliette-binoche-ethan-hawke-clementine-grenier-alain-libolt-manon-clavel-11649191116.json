    "body": "‘The Truth” won’t set you free. In fact, it won’t leave you alone, partly because of the movie within the movie that serves as a metaphor for the entire story: Somewhere in a sci-fi future, a woman facing terminal illness flees to outer space, where time slows to the point that she doesn’t age. Her daughter, however, does. And over the course of their infrequent reunions on Earth, the daughter gets older while the mother remains the same.<br />It’s enough to make you shudder. Not so the rest of “The Truth,” which is funny, wry, emotionally potent, and like most films by Hirokazu Kore-eda (“Shoplifters,” “Nobody Knows,” “After Life”) operates on multiple levels—usually some kind of domestic tragicomedy under which lies profound existential disquiet. The first film made outside his native Japan by the director, it dates to 2019 (it is welcome whenever) and operates in a zone where very little light separates the performers from what they’re performing."
