    "body": "It was blissful, for a season, to imagine that New York Gov. Kathy Hochul might be a moderating influence in Albany. But examine the state budget deal she cut last week, which is larded with union and corporate welfare, while charting an imprudent fiscal course. Ms. Hochul is Andrew Cuomo without the self-restraint.<br />The $220 billion deal’s most egregious earmark is $600 million to help Ms. Hochul’s hometown football team, the Buffalo Bills, build a new stadium. The New York Post reports that the stadium subsidy was part of wrangling that pushed up the budget’s overall price tag. “The tradeoff is: We get $4 billion to add to Hochul’s $216 billion,” an Assembly Democrat told the newspaper."
