    "body": "On Dec. 28, 1934, Sir Hughe Montgomery Knatchbull-Hugessen, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Persia—good luck parodying that—wrote to George Rendel, the Head of the Eastern Department of Britain’s Foreign Office, describing “an absurd note” from the local government, “asking us to speak of ‘Iran’ and ‘Iranian’ instead of ‘Persia’ and ‘Persians.’ ”: “I understand the person originally responsible for this is Herodotus, who, not being able to foresee the sensitivities of the modern Persian, was insufficiently polite in his references to this country.”<br />“Persia” and Knatchbull-Hugessen are no more—the latter eventually undone by the disloyalty and Nazi predilections of his Albanian valet, who passed clandestine photographs of his papers onto the German ambassador in Ankara. But the Herodotean influence on how the region’s ancient history is taught and perceived in the West remain. Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones’s “Persians: The Age of the Great Kings” is the sort of book one would prescribe for Knatchbull-Hugessen, or perhaps bludgeon him with, today."
