    "body": "When Albany passed a House reapportionment plan in February, we called it a jerrymander, since it forced Rep. Jerry Nadler’s New York City district to perform contortions worthy of Cirque du Soleil. Democrats drew that map intending to send four congressional Republicans into early political retirement.<br />But the Legislature was too obviously eager to take partisan advantage, and on Wednesday a majority on the state’s highest court blocked the gerrymander. Voters in 2014 amended New York’s constitution to hand redistricting to an independent commission, as well as to prohibit the drawing of lines for raw partisan ends. Albany thumbed its nose at voters the first chance it got."
