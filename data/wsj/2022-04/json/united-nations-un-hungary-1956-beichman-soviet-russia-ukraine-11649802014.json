    "body": "Nobody should be surprised at the U.N.’s failure to act decisively in the face of Russian aggression (“When Russia Loses the U.N. . . .,” Review & Outlook, April 8). On Nov. 4, 1956, after the Russian invasion of Hungary, Anna Kéthly, Hungarian delegate to the U.N., flew to New York to appeal to the General Assembly for assistance. Our father, journalist Arnold Beichman, worked in New York with Kéthly and her colleagues to draft these appeals.<br />That Thanksgiving, invited by my family for dinner, she and her colleagues, at my father’s well-meaning request, stood around our dining-room table singing the Hungarian anthem. Midway through, tears overtook them and they could not go on. Their country’s dream of a democratic future was being crushed by Soviet tanks, and the world was standing by, doing nothing. This was a powerful early memory and remains a stark lesson in the weakness of the international community in the face of naked aggression."
