    "body": "Your editorial “California’s French Workweek” (April 16) brought back memories from before I retired. We were acquiring a French company, and I was in Lyon for due diligence when one executive told me that they were going to a 35-hour workweek. I said that we could work with that. “You don’t understand,” he told me, “we will be working for 35 hours but you will pay us for 40.” I told him that if they did that, I would close the factory and move it to China.<br />They did it. Guess what happened?"
