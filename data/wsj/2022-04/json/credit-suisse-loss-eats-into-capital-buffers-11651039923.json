    "body": "Credit Suisse Group AG  made more changes to its management team Wednesday and reported a quarterly loss due to weak business conditions and higher costs from lawsuits.<br />The bankâ€™s net loss for the first quarter was around $284 million, following a $2.2 billion loss in the last three months of 2021. Its main capital ratio slipped to 13.8% from 14.4% at the end of December. Unless the bank returns to profitability, the drop in its capital could weigh on its ability to conduct buybacks and pay dividends."
