    "body": "The Food and Drug Administration’s job is to determine whether a treatment is safe and effective. As your editorial “Sandbagging an Alzheimer’s Treatment” (April 14) notes, that is a clinical judgment.<br />Whether the treatment is cost-effective and should be paid for by the government or insurers is a political judgment, not a clinical judgment. “This is the first time CMS has restricted drug coverage in such a way,” you write. It’s about time. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services should spend money where it will do the most good. That means cost-benefit analysis, which progressives are not known to embrace. They shouldn’t be criticized for doing so now."
