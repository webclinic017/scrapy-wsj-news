    "body": "Before the pandemic, I didn’t think of life insurance as something I needed. Why would I? At the end of 2019, I was 25 years old and newly married. I had no children. The only time I thought about life insurance was when it came up as the killer’s hidden motive in true-crime documentaries. (I watch a lot of true-crime documentaries.)<br />But last year, my husband, Ryan, and I decided to apply for policies. As we completed our online applications, I was self-congratulatory, full of pride. Every so often, I sang our praises to my husband: “Look at how responsible we are!”"
