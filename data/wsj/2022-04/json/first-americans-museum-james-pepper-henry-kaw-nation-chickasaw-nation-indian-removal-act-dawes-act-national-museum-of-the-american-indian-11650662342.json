    "body": "Oklahoma City<br />Oklahoma occupies a unique place in American history. It is home to more Native American nations than any other state, but that didn’t happen naturally. In the 1800s, the federal government drove 67 tribes from their ancestral homelands into the area then known as the Oklahoma and Indian territories—from the Ottawa in the North and the Delaware in the East to the Seminole in the South and the Modoc in the West. By Oklahoma statehood in 1907, 39 remained—and 39 remain today. Only four (the Caddo, Plains Apache, Tonkawa and Wichita) originally lived on this land; four others came seasonally or to hunt."
