    "body": "In 2018 I asked on these pages, “Why is the U.S. relying on adversaries to supply it with uranium?” Since then, a large U.S. supplier—Russia—has gone from adversary to aggressor to having its leaders accused of war crimes.<br />Vladimir Putin’s Ukraine invasion exposed the foolishness of relying on despotic regimes for resources, particularly energy. Under pressure from Congress, President Biden belatedly banned Russian oil, natural-gas and coal imports. But he continues to ignore the fuel powering 20% of U.S. electricity generation—uranium. More than 90% of the uranium that fuels U.S. power plants is imported, and Russia is the third-largest supplier. In 2021 Russian imports cost almost $1 billion, money that helped underwrite Mr. Putin’s war machine."
