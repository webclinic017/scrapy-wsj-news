    "body": "Google parent  Alphabet Inc.  posted slower sales growth as global economic turmoil disrupted digital advertising spending.<br />The company said first quarter sales rose 23% from the year-ago period, the lowest rate for the tech giant since late 2020. The company at the time saw a period of massive sales growth, as small and large businesses alike flooded into the ad market seeking to win customers who spent the early period of the pandemic sequestered in their homes. Company sales advanced 41% last year."
