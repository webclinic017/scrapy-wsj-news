    "body": "Southeast Asia’s largest consumer internet firm is shuttering its e-commerce business in the world’s second-most-populous nation. That might be a sign of things to come as investors become much more skeptical of big, costly growth plans in a tougher global-market environment for tech.<br />In fast-growing emerging markets like Southeast Asia and India in particular, incumbents that have achieved scale might fare better. Plucky startups and foreign latecomers, on the other hand, could have a much tougher time convincing investors they should burn cash to expand in new markets, particularly with spending on online consumer services like gaming struggling as economies reopen."
