    "body": "My hunch about why cultural conservatives are drooling over Viktor Orbán differs from Rod Dreher’s (“How to Think About Hungary’s Viktor Orbán,” Letters, April 13). I suspect they are using Prime Minister Orbán as a totem in America’s culture war, and don’t actually know much about Hungary. But unlike Mr. Dreher, I’ve never been a visiting fellow at a Budapest think tank financed by the Hungarian government, which could influence my judgment.<br />Mr. Orbán is having trouble with the European Union. It’s worried about corruption in Hungary and the independence of Hungary’s judiciary. As a result, the EU has refused to distribute seven billion euros in Covid-recovery funds and initiated a rule-of-law mechanism that could deprive Hungary of billions more. Mr. Orbán needed to explain this situation to voters, so he scheduled a referendum to ask Hungarians if they want their children to be exposed to transgender ideology. According to Mr. Orbán, the EU won’t hand out subsidies to Hungary because the country rejects gender ideology."
