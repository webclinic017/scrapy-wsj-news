    "body": "President Biden has been in office for 15 months and has yet to speak with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. It isn’t for lack of trying on Mr. Bolsonaro’s part. But Mr. Biden has declined to take his call and hasn’t initiated one of his own.<br />If Mr. Bolsonaro is on the U.S. president’s blacklist, he isn’t alone. In the world of Biden geopolitics, foreign policy is a tool to settle grudges and advance progressive ideology. Yes, U.S. leadership is concerned with shared interests. But for Team Biden that means bullying, badgering and even blocking access to the president when a country doesn’t share the administration’s interests."
