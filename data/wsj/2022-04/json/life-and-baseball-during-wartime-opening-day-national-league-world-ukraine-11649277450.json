    "body": "My earliest baseball memories date from 1946, when I was 8 and the Boston Red Sox lost the World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals. I recall the sorrow the Sox fans in my New Haven, Conn., neighborhood grimly endured.<br />World War II had ended a year earlier, and I associated its conclusion with the return home of my beloved uncle Ed from Italy and also with emergence from the odd wartime life of ration books, drawn shades at night and the worries about dangers I barely understood as a child."
