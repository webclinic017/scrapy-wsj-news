    "body": "The advertising industry welcomed  Netflix Inc.’s  decision to explore offering a lower-priced ad-supported version of its service, a move that would give marketers a chance to reach younger viewers who have abandoned traditional television.<br />Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Reed Hastings on Tuesday said the company was open to rolling out an ad-supported tier in the near future. The move was a stark reversal for an executive who just two years ago said he wanted Netflix to be a “safe respite where you can explore, get stimulated, have fun, enjoy, relax—and have none of the controversy around exploiting users with advertising.”"
