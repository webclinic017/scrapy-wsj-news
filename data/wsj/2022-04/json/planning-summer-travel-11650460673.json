According to the U.S. Travel Association (USTA), 85% of Americans plan to travel this season, which means crowded roads and airports. “After two years of travel cancellations or delays, there’s so much excitement about getting back out there to travel again,” said Daniel del Olmo, president and chief operating officer of Sage Hospitality Management, which runs more than 50 hotels around the U.S. “We’re expecting this to be a busy summer across the country.”<br />Those travelers will likely be paying more: Gas prices are higher than they’ve been since 2014. USTA says travel costs overall are up 12% from 2019. Flight-booking app Hopper estimates that domestic airfares have increased 7% since that year, and almost 11% from February to March, according to the consumer-price index. And while the crowds promise to be back, staff isn’t. The American Hotel & Lodging Association’s 2022 state of the industry report projects that worker shortages will continue to plague properties this year."
