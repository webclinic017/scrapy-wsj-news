    "body": "“I GOT INTO this industry because I fell in love with food and I love to party,” said chef Mason Hereford. “If there’s a way to get from point A to point B faster when I’m cooking, then there’s more time to party.” In “Turkey and the Wolf: Flavor Trippin’ in New Orleans” (Jun. 21, Ten Speed Press), he brings the good times home with simple, enthusiastically seasoned recipes like the romesco sauce featured here.<br />Mr. Hereford’s second Slow Food Fast contribution offers a quick and slightly unconventional take on the nutty Spanish sauce, swapping in chipotle chiles for the traditional roasted red peppers. The spicy, smoky result is sensational drizzled over wedges of roasted sweet potato. A confetti of toasted almonds, torn basil and briny feta provides a contrast of colors, textures and flavors that “just works,” the chef said."
