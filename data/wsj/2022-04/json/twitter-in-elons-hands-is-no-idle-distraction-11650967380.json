    "body": "Elon Musk may like to kid around on  Twitter ,  but his impending ownership of the platform is no joke, to him or anyone else.<br />Mr. Musk maintains his interest in Twitter isn’t about money, but empirically it very much is. Not only will the company now account for around a sixth of his net worth, the world’s largest, it will also put him in hock to creditors. His discourse on the platform—both strategic and slipshod—has for years earned him free publicity for his other wildly ambitious business ventures. Just how much the avian-themed microblogging service had to do with his wider success is debatable, but based on his intense interest in how it is managed, it seems safe to say he believes it was significant."
