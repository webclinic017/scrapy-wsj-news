    "body": "The Ukraine war is coming to Wall Street as a new earnings season gets underway and more companies write down their Russia investments.

JPMorgan ,   Goldman Sachs  and  Citigroup  combined have set aside $3.36 billion as reserves against credit losses, according to a tally by Reuters, much of that related to concerns over Russia."
