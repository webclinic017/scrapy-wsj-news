    "body": "The Ukraine war “has redrawn the contours of the world economic outlook,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in an April 13 speech. She invoked the precedent of the Bretton Woods meeting in 1944, which designed the current economic system following World War II.<br />The Biden administration tends to place undue faith in multilateral solutions to global problems, but Ms. Yellen offered one clear and pathbreaking idea that officials should seriously consider: a new trade architecture “on terms that work better for American workers.” Calling out especially China for its support of Russia, she asserted that the new system should be organized by “countries we know we can count on.”"
