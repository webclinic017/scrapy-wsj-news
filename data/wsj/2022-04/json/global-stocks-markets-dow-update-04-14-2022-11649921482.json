    "body": "U.S. stock futures were little changed as investors awaited a batch of reports from major financial firms, seeking clues on how soaring inflation and signs of slowing growth were expected to affect businesses.<br />Futures tied to the S&P 500 were flat, a day after the broad index rebounded 1.1% to snap a three-day losing streak. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 0.2%, while Nasdaq-100 futures gained 0.1%, putting technology firms on course for mild gains after the opening bell."
