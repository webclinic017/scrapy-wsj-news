    "body": "Well, this could be entertaining. In a week Elon Musk has moved from holding a 9.2% stake in  Twitter  with a seat on the board to offering to buy out the social-media site for $43 billion cash. The offer is causing a meltdown in progressive circles that don’t appreciate Mr. Musk as much on free speech as they do when he’s building electric cars.<br />“I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,” Mr. Musk wrote in announcing his bid. “I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form.” He is offering $54.20 a share. Before his stake went public, the stock was trading near $39. Twitter lost $221 million in 2021 and $1.1 billion in 2020, and it might miss its target for user growth. Many shareholders will want to take Mr. Musk’s money and run."
