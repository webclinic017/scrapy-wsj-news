    "body": "Russia is escalating its war in Ukraine again, with a new offensive in the east and missile strikes against cities across the country. The assaults are likely to accelerate the flood of refugees that reached a grim milestone this week. More than five million Ukrainians have fled the nation of 43 million since the war began Feb. 24, according to the United Nations refugee agency.<br />The flight to the European Union has been staggering: Poland (2,847,540), Romania (763,769), Hungary (476,213) and Slovakia (346,175). Tiny Moldova, a Ukrainian neighbor and EU aspirant, has taken in 428,577. For comparison, the Syrian civil war created some 6.8 million refugees over a decade."
