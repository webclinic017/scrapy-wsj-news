    "body": "James Freeman is right to praise the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, my alma mater, for bringing back standardized testing for admissions, which was suspended during Covid (“Go Tech!” Best of the Web, March 29). But he gives MIT too much credit. The school has not done anything to end the racially discriminatory admissions policies it implemented in the 1990s to restrict the number of Asian-American students and increase the number of black and Hispanic students.<br />As shown in a 2018 analysis of MIT enrollment data by Althea Nagai, the university implemented preferences and racial quotas to cap the number of Asian-American students admitted and to admit other minority students with lower academic qualifications, credentials and test scores. As a result, the admission rate of Asian Americans topped out at about a quarter of the freshman class."
