    "body": "Media folk are on Twitter today debating the ethics of the Washington Post’s rhetorical attack on a woman who doesn’t want public school teachers talking to kindergarteners about sex. There’s another opinion piece in the Post that also deserves attention.<br />This column has often asked: What would we do without experts? This question is perhaps especially useful in considering today’s offering from the Post’s health columnist, Dr. Leana Wen. The Post notes Dr. Wen’s credentials as a professor at George Washington University, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of the recent book “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.”"
