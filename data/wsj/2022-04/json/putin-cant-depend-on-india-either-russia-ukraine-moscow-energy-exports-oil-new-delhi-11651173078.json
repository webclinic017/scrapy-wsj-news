    "body": "India’s neutrality in the growing confrontation between Russia and the West over Ukraine is causing heartburn in Western capitals. But while disappointment may be justified, undue focus on New Delhi’s unwillingness to condemn Moscow or impose sanctions misses an important detail: India’s apparent forbearance toward Russia is largely symbolic. As a practical matter, New Delhi is unlikely to help its “special and privileged strategic partner” stave off Western pressure.<br />Take energy. Since the conflict in Ukraine began, India has placed orders for at least 40 million barrels of Russian oil on the cheap—more than twice as much as it purchased in all of 2021. This might seem to signal a willingness to give Moscow the cash it desperately needs by increasing energy imports. As the world’s third-largest importer of oil, India could make a big difference for Vladimir Putin. And the low price could make a big difference for New Delhi. According to a 2019 Reserve Bank of India study, every extra dollar a barrel India pays for oil imports increases the country’s budget deficit by $1.25 billion."
