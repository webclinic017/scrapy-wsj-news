    "body": "THOUGH AN EIGHT-TIME Grammy-nominated artist, Janelle Monáe speaks more like a friend you’ve lost touch with than the A-list star she is. Chatting via Zoom from the Atlanta office at her production company Wondaland Arts Society, Ms. Monáe brimmed with the energy of someone with exciting news she can’t wait to share. “I’m a time traveler,” she said matter-of-factly early in our conversation.<br />Take her most recent album, 2018’s “Dirty Computer,” on which she mixes influences from several eras—as diverse as old-school soul, progressive rock and 1980s and ‘90s pop—to tell a story rooted in the technology at our disposal today. The result: music that brings the past to life but sounds futuristic. Her acting performances, as both historical figures (“Harriet,” “Hidden Figures”) and those history forgets (“Moonlight”), often pull off the same creative trick."
