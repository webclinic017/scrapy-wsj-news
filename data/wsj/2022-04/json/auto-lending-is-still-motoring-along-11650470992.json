    "body": "Banks are going to need solid loan growth to outrun some of their recent challenges. Auto lending might provide a lift, so long as banks don’t violate any speed limits.<br />Across several large banks with auto-lending units—a group including  Ally Financial ,   JPMorgan Chase  and  Wells Fargo —the average growth year over year in auto loans was just over 13% in the first quarter, only a bit slower than in the fourth quarter, according to figures tracked by analysts at  Piper Sandler .  That is more than twice the pace of overall loan growth across U.S. banks in the quarter, according to Federal Reserve data."
