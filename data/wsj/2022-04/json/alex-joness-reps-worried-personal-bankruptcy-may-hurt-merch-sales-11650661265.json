    "body": "A restructuring officer for conspiracy site Infowars said Friday that representatives for its founder Alex Jones worried the radio-host would damage his brand and his ability to sell merchandise if he also joined his media assets in filing for bankruptcy.<br />W. Mark Schwartz, an accountant tapped to serve as Infowars’ chief restructuring officer, said Friday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Victoria, Texas, that Mr. Jones is a prominent figure in the conspiracy theorist community and people working on the bankruptcy case worried that putting him in chapter 11 personally would hinder “his value to us in generating cash flow.”"
