    "body": "AT THE RISK of triggering horrible, gingham-tinged flashbacks, let’s revisit the Zoom shirt. For at least a year, starting in March 2020, these inoffensive, often gingham or plaid shirts were what homebound men and women wore on video call after video call. Suits were mothballed. Ties? Forget about it. But the button-up Zoom shirt—even if wrinkled, mustard-stained and musty—helped you maintain a modicum of formality while working within sight of your bed. (The patterns helped to hide the food splotches and distract your colleagues from your creases.)<br />The Zoom shirt was a one-size-fits-all solution to pandemic dressing. It was also, to the dismay of many apparel retailers, unlikely to be a freshly purchased shirt. In the early stages of the pandemic, “we really saw the casualization of that silhouette happening and the dress-shirt business was under a lot of pressure,” said Ken Ohashi, CEO of Brooks Brothers. Shirtmakers point to 2020 as the nadir of the collared-shirt business. (For Brooks, things were especially dire—it filed for bankruptcy in July of that year.) As Zooming men turned to shirts and sweaters that were already hanging in their closets, sales of new dress shirts withered."
