    "body": "One of the cardinal rules among U.S. practitioners of fiscal and monetary policy is that Treasury officials do not discuss monetary policy and Federal Reserve authorities do not discuss exchange rates. That’s what makes your editorial “The Trials of the Powell Dollar” (April 19) audacious—but nevertheless spot on.<br />By daring to link Fed efforts to fight inflation through higher interest rates to the performance of the dollar against other currencies, you lift the veil on a dirty secret: Central banks are currency manipulators, even when they are motivated by domestic economic objectives. But trying to finesse the risks against rewards is tricky business; one nation’s monetary hawkishness is another’s export advantage."
