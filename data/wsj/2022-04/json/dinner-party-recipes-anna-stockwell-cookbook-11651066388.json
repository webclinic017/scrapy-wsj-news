    "body": "ROAST CHICKEN and a big salad will always be one of my favorite dinners to serve guests at home. Itâ€™s a perfect mix of cozy and fresh, especially appropriate in the spring, when the salad can be abundant with baby lettuce.<br />Two platters of food are all you need for this simple spring dinner party: one full of yogurt-brined chicken halves, the other, spring greens with fried dates. Add a loaf of bread and a make-ahead spiced green sauce to drag slices of chicken through. I like to place the platters right on the table and let guests pass them around, to share and come back for more as they wish. This passing and re-passing not only puts people in charge of what goes on their plates; it also creates a natural movement and connection that feeds more than just bellies."
