    "body": "Monday, Jan. 23, 1978: The 40-year-old Baron Édouard-Jean Empain, “Wado” to friends, ex-champion skier, Redfordesque sandy-handsome with the hauteur that comes from inheriting an industrial complex of 174 companies and 136,000 workers, leaves his marble-lined apartment on Avenue Foch. He maintains a château near Paris, has a position of leverage among the haute monde, and embodies all the advantages of the global elite in one poker-playing, schussing-in-Megève person, a shining figure of France’s postwar boom. His nickname has been “Monsieur Nucléaire” since one of his subsidiary companies won a monopoly contract to build 16 nuclear power stations.<br />At the hereditary-boss hour of 10:20 a.m., he steps into the back of his Peugeot, his chauffeur Jean Denis at the wheel, for the 15-minute journey to his office. A scooter topples over in front of them, Denis slams on the brakes, a truck blocks the car from the rear. Four masked, armed men take the chauffeur, another four the baron in his own car. Duct tape, a black hood, cold steel on skin, a gun barrel at his temple."
