    "body": "The establishment of Israel in May 1948 was never a foregone conclusion. One might assume that, with the Holocaust so recent, it was almost inevitable: a tragedy-born fulfillment of the long-held dream of an independent Jewish state. In fact, a great deal of dramatic maneuvering was required, not least in the newly formed United Nations.<br />The central question was what to do about Palestine. The so-called British Mandate had been authorized in 1922 by the League of Nations, giving Britain political authority over Palestine but aiming, ultimately, to prepare the country for self-government. But now, amid growing unrest between Arabs and Jews, the Mandate was coming to an end and the British were poised to withdraw. The U.N.’s General Assembly had to decide how to divide—even whether to divide—the land between the two warring communities."
