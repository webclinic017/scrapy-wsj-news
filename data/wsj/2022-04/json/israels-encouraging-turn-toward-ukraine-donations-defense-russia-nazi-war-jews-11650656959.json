    "body": "Israel has been condemned, both by its opponents and some of its friends, for being too neutral toward Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. One of Jerusalem’s most fervent supporters, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), was “very disappointed” by Israel’s refusal to sell the Iron Dome antirocket system to Ukraine. Former Trump national security adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster said “Israelis ought to be embarrassed” by their government’s lack of support for Kyiv. Critics belittle Jerusalem’s mediation efforts, which, they claim, are contrary to U.S. and Ukrainian interests. I too was critical at first, publicly warning of the dangers, both moral and diplomatic, of an evenhanded Israeli approach to the war. But Israel has since turned to take a principled stand for Ukraine.<br />After refusing to back a United Nations Security Council condemnation of Russia for the invasion, Israel supported a similar General Assembly resolution denouncing Russia’s aggression. More recently, the Jewish state has called for Russia’s ouster from the U.N. Human Rights Council. Explaining the vote, Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid stated that “intentionally harming a civilian population is a war crime and I strongly condemn it.” Moscow’s Foreign Ministry responded with a blistering censure of his “anti-Russian attack.”"
