    "body": "U.S. economic growth likely cooled in the first quarter, economists say, as supply disruptions, labor shortages and high inflation slowed the pace of the recovery.<br />Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimate that U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 1.0% annual rate in the first three months of the year, down from a 6.9% rate at the end of last year. That would mark the slowest rate since spring 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic and related shutdowns drove the U.S. economy into a deep—albeit short—recession."
