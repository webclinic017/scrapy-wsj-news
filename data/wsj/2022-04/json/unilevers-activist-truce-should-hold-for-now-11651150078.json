    "body": "Unilever ’s  new activist investor Nelson Peltz has remained in the background so far and the company’s latest results should help to keep it that way.<br />The consumer staples business behind brands such as Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and Dove soap increased sales by 7.3% in the first three months of 2022 compared with the same period a year earlier. Growth was slightly faster than European peer  Danone  and well ahead of the 4.4% forecast by analysts covering the stock."
