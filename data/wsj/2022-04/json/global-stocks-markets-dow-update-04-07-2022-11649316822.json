    "body": "U.S. stock futures edged higher and a selloff in U.S. government bonds stabilized as investors digested the possibility of more aggressive monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve.<br />Futures for the S&P 500 edged up 0.2% Thursday, a day after the benchmark gauge fell 1%. The selloff Wednesday followed the release of minutes from the Fed that showed central bankers considered raising rates by a half-percentage point at their March meeting, higher than the quarter-point increase with which they proceeded."
