    "body": "Havencrest Capital Management has raised $356 million for its second fund focused on investing in smaller healthcare companies, as investors continue to reward specialist investment managers.<br />“Healthcare is a very nuanced industry,” said Christopher W. Kersey, who founded Havencrest in 2017 after a career backing healthcare deals at growth equity firm Camden Partners. “You really do need to have lived it to understand what’s happening with the trends [and] to avoid areas that might be overly burdensome.”"
