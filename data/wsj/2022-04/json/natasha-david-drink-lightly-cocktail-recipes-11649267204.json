    "body": "WHEN NITECAP, the small, sparkly, subterranean bar on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, closed in Sept. 2020, cocktail fans mourned. And yet, for proprietor Natasha David, it was the beginning of a new era. Living upstate in the mid-Hudson Valley with her two young children and her husband, Jeremy Oertel, also a noted bartender, Ms. David began working on her first book, “Drink Lightly,” published this week by Clarkson Potter.<br />The book pays glittery homage to Nitecap and the playful, low-alcohol drinks—spritzes, highballs and the like—for which Ms. David has become known. Why the focus on low- and no-ABV drinks? The author credits hazy childhood memories of her mother, a Japanese-American concert pianist, sipping white wine spritzes while preparing to host dinner parties. When the time came to open her bar in 2014, “I wanted to make sure I paid homage to the drink that started it all for me,” she writes. Sure enough, the inaugural menu featured a wine spritz, albeit an upscale variation called the Pinkies Out, made with Cocchi Americano Bianco, chamomile-infused blanc vermouth, tart verjus and hard sparkling cider."
