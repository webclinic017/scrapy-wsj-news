    "body": "In this age of staggeringly massive buildings, merely scraping the sky is a quaint accomplishment. City skylines throughout the world now include towers that reach atmospheric heights unthinkable in an earlier era. As Stefan Al writes in “Supertall: How the World’s Tallest Buildings Are Reshaping Our Cities and Our Lives,” these lofty structures are “the cathedrals of our time.”<br />Supertalls arrive with the same frequency as characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Mr. Al, a Dutch architect based in New York, writes that “we are living in an urban age where the most tangible architectural expression . . . is the supertall.” In 1996, he notes, the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat only classed four buildings as “supertall”: 984 feet or taller. “Today, there are more than one hundred seventy, with about a dozen completed every year—each taller than the Empire State Building.”"
