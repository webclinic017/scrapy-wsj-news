    "body": "DON'T WAIT FOR a super bloom in order to stop and admire the wildflowers; any winter without a serious drought results in carpets of springtime color in destinations all over the United States, starting in February in desert climates and running through autumn in alpine areas. Wildflower tourism is “increasing dramatically,” according to Michelle Bivens, executive director of the Crested Butte Wildflower Festival, attributed in part to the notorious psychedelic colorburst out West in 2019. Instagram has 6.2 million mentions for the hashtag “wildflowers” and recent super blooms have even inspired a cult natural wine from Las Jaras. The following locations have hikes for all skill levels, plus guided options to increase your flower-spotting power.<br />The canyon surrounding the Pacific Northwest’s Columbia River is at its polychromatic peak in April and May. Capitalize on nature’s generosity by taking one of dozens of vigorous hikes accessible from the scenic highway on the Oregon side of the river (such as the Mosier Plateau trail), or off Route 14 on the Washington state side (like the popular Dog Mountain loop). Or get two legs up with a boost-bike on a wildflower tour from Sol Rides. In The Dalles, Ore., you can also take a self-guided flower-themed walk at the Columbia Gorge Discovery Center & Museum."
