    "body": "More Europeans and Americans purport to care about Hungarian politics than probably should, so Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s re-election Sunday will stir discussion, especially on the political right. Here’s a friendly reminder that whatever else this vote demonstrates, it isn’t the vanguard of a new Christian nationalist movement that can or will lead the West.<br />Mr. Orban cruised to his fourth term, winning 53% of the vote for his coalition and 135 out of 199 seats in the parliament, compared to 35% of the vote for the next largest opposition group. The result shows that Mr. Orban’s agenda suits some portion of the electorate. This is especially true of his approach to cultural issues, where his conservative views on sexual ethics may be closer to the European mainstream than his critics elsewhere in the European Union care to admit."
