    "body": "‘The first step in winning is believing you can win,” Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in Kyiv on Sunday. “They believe that we can win; we believe that they can win if they have the right equipment, the right support.” Yet U.S. and North Atlantic Treaty Organization aid to Ukraine has been too little, too late.<br />The war is being waged in the air, on sea and on land. The air war was conceded to Russia a month ago when President Biden, unnerved by Vladimir Putin’s threats, vetoed the transfer of Polish MiGs to Ukraine. With Russia bombing civilians daily, that timorous decision must be reversed."
