    "body": "Mob behavior is rarely admirable. An ugly eruption by fans at Yankee Stadium on Saturday demonstrated the thin veneer separating boisterous celebrations of a hometown win from serious and potentially criminal misconduct.<br />In their final at bat, the Yankees rallied to tie the score against the Cleveland Guardians—formerly the Indians—with a hard-hit drive by shortstop Isiah Kiner-Falefa that barely cleared the leaping grasp of Cleveland left fielder Steve Kwan, who slammed into the outfield wall. As the tying run scored, Mr. Kwan fell to the grass, obviously hurt. The fans’ roar turned then into that awful emotion of victorious vengeance. “Take that” was the unspoken message."
