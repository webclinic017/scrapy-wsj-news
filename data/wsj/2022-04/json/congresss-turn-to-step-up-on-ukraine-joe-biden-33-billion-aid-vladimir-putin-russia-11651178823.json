    "body": "The Biden Administration on Thursday rolled out a $33 billion request for assistance for Ukraine, and let’s hope Congress doesn’t suddenly plead poverty. Vladimir Putin seems set on a long war, and the investment in defeating him will be cheap if it succeeds.<br />About $20 billion of the package is earmarked for military aid, with more for a mix of humanitarian and economic assistance, as well as sanctions enforcement. “The cost of this fight is not cheap. But caving to aggression is going to be more costly, if we allow it to happen,” said President Biden."
