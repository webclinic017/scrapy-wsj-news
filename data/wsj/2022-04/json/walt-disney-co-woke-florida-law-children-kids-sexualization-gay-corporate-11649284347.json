    "body": "Gerard Baker hits the mark in “Disney Decides to Go for Woke” (Free Expression, April 5). The corporate brain trust running  Disney  is cutting off the hands that have fed them generously for 99 years now.<br />The children who flock to Disney movies and theme parks and wear the costumes and princess dresses don’t plunk down the money to do so. Their parents and grandparents do and have done so to excess over the generations. Those parents are now being told what horrible, ignorant people they are. And that they need to butt out of the raising of their own kids."
