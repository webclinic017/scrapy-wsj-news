    "body": "In a self-destructive move, Prime Minister Imran Khan made a mockery of Pakistan’s democratic process on Sunday when he claimed that a foreign conspiracy against him was under way. After Parliament’s deputy speaker from Mr. Khan’s ruling party blocked a no-confidence vote, Mr. Khan dissolved Parliament and called for early elections. The decision stunned the country and triggered a constitutional crisis, prompting the Supreme Court to step in and declare Parliament’s ruling unconstitutional. The court restored Parliament on Thursday and ordered it to hold a no-confidence vote against Mr. Khan on Saturday.<br />A consortium of opposition parties initiated the chaotic no-confidence vote against Mr. Khan’s government, faulting him for economic mismanagement, toxic internal politics, abusive governance and foreign-policy mishaps. Mr. Khan accused his opposition of conspiring with the U.S. to topple his government, labeling his opposition “national traitors.”"
